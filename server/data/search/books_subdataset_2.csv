,,True,3.13,"Mein Kampf (""My Struggle"") is a political manifesto written by Adolf Hitler. It was his only complete book and became the bible of National Socialism in the German Third Reich. It was published in two volumes, which dated 1925 and 1927. By 1939 it had sold 5,200,000 copies and had been translated into 11 different languages.
The first volume, entitled Die Abrechnung (""The Settlement of Accounts,"" or ""Revenge""), was written in 1924 in the Bavarian fortress of Landsberg am Lech. Hitler was imprisoned there after the unsuccessful Beer Hall Putsch of 1923. It describes the world of Hitlers youth, the First World War and the betrayal of Germany in 1918. It also expresses Hitlers Racial ideology. According to Hitler, it was necessary for Germans to occupy themselves not merely with the breeding of cats, dogs and horses - but also care for the health and wellbeing of their own Bloodline. The second volume, entitled Die Nationalsozialistische Bewegung (""The National Socialist Movement""), was written after Hitlers release from prison in December 1924. It outlines the political program of National Socialism and includes the measures that National Socialism must pursue in both gaining power and in exercising it thereafter in the new German Reich.
In this book Hitler describes an ideology which according to him must shake the world from its slumber. An ideology which is based on the Eternal Laws of Nature. Here you can notice how the foundations of Social Darwinism have been applied in practice. This book has set a path toward a much higher understanding of the self and of our magnificent destiny as living beings part of this Race on our planet. It shows us that we must not look at nature in terms of good or bad, but in an unfiltered manner. It describes what we must do if we want to survive as a people and as a Race. We have to understand that Nature does not forgive weakness and that the truth and reality is what it is, no matter how bad it may seem or how hard it can portray itself. This book shows the foundations of White Resistance and White Nationalism. It is the foundation and seed for the preservation of our Race. Be advised that this book does not represent the full Racialist ideology, but it is only a foundation as the Origin of Species is a foundation for the Theory of Evolution.",,,0,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,25431990,"Mein Kampf - My Struggle: Unabridged edition of Hitlers original book - Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice",0000-00-00,history;historical fiction;biography;non-fiction;comics;graphic,Adolf Hitler;Rudolf Hess

,,True,3.58,"The Venetians' language and way of thinking set them aside from the rest of Italy. They are an island people, linked to the sea and to the tides rather than the land. This latest work from the incomparable Peter Ackroyd, like a magic gondola, transports its listeners to that sensual and surprising city.His account embraces facts and romance, conjuring up the atmosphere of the canals, bridges, and sunlit squares, the churches and the markets, the festivals and the flowers. He leads us through the history of the city, from the first refugees arriving in the mists of the lagoon in the fourth century to the rise of a great mercantile state and its trading empire, the wars against Napoleon, and the tourist invasions of today. Everything is here: the merchants on the Rialto and the Jews in the ghetto; the glassblowers of Murano; the carnival masks and the sad colonies of lepers; the artists-Bellini, Titian, Tintoretto, Tiepolo; and the ever-present undertone of Venice's shadowy corners and dead ends, of prisons and punishment, wars and sieges, scandals and seductions.Ackroyd's Venice: Pure City is a study of Venice much in the vein of his lauded London: The Biography. Like London, Venice is a fluid, writerly exploration organized around a number of themes. History and context are provided in each chapter, but Ackroyd's portrait of Venice is a particularly novelistic one, both beautiful and rapturous.

,en-US,True,3.47,"With a foreword by Cynthia Ozick, this semiautobiographical novel of a Jewish girl forced away from home in the face of Nazi persecution is an extraordinary tale of fortitude and survival
On a December night in 1938, a ten-year-old girl named Lore is put on the Kindertransport, a train carrying hundreds of Jewish children out of Austria to safety from Hitler's increasingly alarming oppression. Temporarily housed at the Dover Court Camp on England's east coast, Lore will find herself living in other people's houses for the next seven years: the Orthodox Levines, the Hoopers, the working-class Grimsleys, and the wealthy Miss Douglas and Mrs. Dillon.
Charged with the task of asking ""the English people"" to get her parents out of Austria, Lore discovers in herself an impassioned writer. In letters to potential sponsors, she details the horrors happening back at home; in those to her parents, she notes the mannerisms and reactions of the new families around her as she valiantly tries to master their language. And the closer the world comes to a new war, the more resolute Lore becomes to survive.

1627791698,eng,False,4.1,"From Italy to the Indian Ocean, from Japan to Honduras, a far-reaching examination of the perils of American military bases overseas
American military bases encircle the globe. More than two decades after the end of the Cold War, the U.S. still stations its troops at nearly a thousand locations in foreign lands. These bases are usually taken for granted or overlooked entirely, a little-noticed part of the Pentagon's vast operations. But in an eye-opening account, Base Nationshows that the worldwide network of bases brings with it a panoply of ills--and actually makes the nation less safe in the long run.
As David Vine demonstrates, the overseas bases raise geopolitical tensions and provoke widespread antipathy towards the United States. They also undermine American democratic ideals, pushing the U.S. into partnerships with dictators and perpetuating a system of second-class citizenship in territories like Guam. They breed sexual violence, destroy the environment, and damage local economies. And their financial cost is staggering: though the Pentagon underplays the numbers, Vine's accounting proves that the bill approaches $100 billion per year.
For many decades, the need for overseas bases has been a quasi-religious dictum of U.S. foreign policy. But in recent years, a bipartisan coalition has finally started to question this conventional wisdom. With the U.S. withdrawing from Afghanistan and ending thirteen years of war, there is no better time to re-examine the tenets of our military strategy. Base Nationis an essential contribution to that debate.",Hardcover,Metropolitan Books,418,9781627791694,,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428639064m/22320467.jpg,22320467,Base Nation:  How U.S. Military Bases Abroad Harm America and the World,2015-08-25,history;historical fiction;biography;non-fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,David Vine
