0,19398490,4,"""A beautiful story. It is rare to encounter a book that does such a good job painting the scenes in your mind - you really felt like you were there and got to know the characters and the people they came across. I generally love WWII books and movies, but wasn't sure if I'd like one featuring a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator - but he brings a lot of life to them. 
 That said, the novel drifts around a lot, and the plotline jumping forward and backward in time drove me nuts. 
 I thought a lot about if there is a theme to the book. One was the diamond and if it was really cursed (based on the Hope Diamond perhaps?). Another is that 20K Leagues is an awesome book. But I think the book was a lot about fear and the unknown, and how people deal with it. Marie-Laure was blind and couldn't tell what was happening around her - yet she was the bravest one. Werner was afraid of ending up as a miner, which drove him to join the army, and learn about radios. And Uncle Etienne was afraid dying from a sniper he couldn't see, so he didn't leave his house and he created a radio transmitter. So the moral of the story is... don't be paralyzed by your fears. 
 This, she realizes, is the basis of his fear, all fear. That a light you are powerless to stop will turn on you and usher a bullet to its mark.""",2016-01-03 21:20:46,All the Light We Cannot See,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;young-adult,Anthony Doerr

 So sweet!! Filled with tons of romance and some real emotion. Don't read any spoilers for this book! I'm glad I didn't know anything about it. 
 Renee Carlino's books ALWAYS captivate me. 'Swear on This Life' is one of my all-time favorite stories. I will say that Adam is definitely my favorite thing about this book. *SIGH* Adam is one of the most memorable characters ever created by Ms. Carlino. Impulsive, sweet, charming, creative and loving, he really puts himself out there when he meets Charlotte. While I'm not always a fan of insta-love, it just WORKED here. Charlotte opened up her heart to Adam because he seemed, well, absolutely perfect. 
 I was absolutely enchanted by Adam and could understand how Charlotte fell for him. But life has a funny way of working out and things don't turn out quite how Charlotte expected. There was definitely something off about Adam right from the beginning but I couldn't put my finger on it. 
 ""You're stunning and beautiful and I loved every second of it. I'm sorry you didn't like it. Did I hurt you.?"" 
 ""No, but are you going to paint it?"" 
 ""Paint what?"" 
 ""Us, what we just did?"" 
 ""No."" 
 ""No?"" 
 ""No. I don't need to. I'll never forget it and it's sacred."" 
 The story took a lot of twists and turns and it was definitely one that I was not expecting!! Charlotte has had terrible luck at relationships and let's just say that Adam does not turn out to be everything she expected or imagined. Nonetheless, he still feels like the one love of her life, even though they spent a very short time together. 
 Life moves on and Charlotte gets back in to the dating scene. She meets the adorable Seth, who is a minor-league baseball player. He really likes her but she can't quite forget Adam. Seth is patient and sexy and athletic and funny and smart and is just an all-around wonderful man!! But can Charlotte move on from her brief time with Adam? 
 It was like we already knew each other, like we had met in a previous life. Memories that didn't exist began exploding in my mind like fireworks. 
 This is a lovely, romantic, bittersweet story filled with wonderful life lessons about healing and loving. I also adored all of the characters. This is not at all a love triangle (although I love those, too!). Don't read any spoilers about this one, you will enjoy the book so much more going in blind. The conclusion was just lovely and as always with Renee Carlino's stories, I was sorry to see this one end! 
 ""I want you to know that I am grateful to you. I'm grateful to you now. I got to experience IT in this life, and I don't think it's measured with time."" 
 ""You don't think what's measured with time, Adam?"" 
 ""Love, Charlotte.""

2,28963772,4,"""You're the best mistake I've ever made."" 
 'Four Letter Word' (clever title, no?) was everything I expect from J. Daniels: sweet and funny banter mixed with THE hottest romance and deeply-felt emotion. Brian and Sidney's story was unexpectedly dramatic but completely readable and satisfying! 
 Brian and Sidney meet by accident in the funniest way. Their surprise connection and relationship then develops via text messages and phone calls, BUT it really worked for me! Sidney is completely devastated and betrayed as the story begins, so she will she ever learn to trust another man again? Even one as ""perfect"" as Brian Savage? 
 ""I needed you, but I didn't know I needed you until you reached out to me."" 
 As with all of J. Daniels books, the hero and heroine and totally relatable and very ""real"". They have regular jobs, very good friends and and just came across as very down-to-earth. The secondary characters here were all wonderful: great supportive friends who stood by Brian and Sidney through everything! 
 Brian was a fantastic, sexy, dirty-talking Alpha with a sweet and loving and sensitive side. He and Sidney have fantastic chemistry and I was rooting for them to make things work. I absolutely loved how Brian always tried to do the right thing and be the perfect man for Sidney. He made some terrible sacrifices and poor choices BUT he completely won me over with the way he treated Sidney! 
 'She couldn't know too much. She could never know. Never. I gave her enough so I could still have her, but I took everything.' 
 'Four Letter Word' was a wonderfully paced and steamy story, perfect for when you crave a sweet and sexy contemporary romance. J. Daniels is one of my go-to romance authors, and she really delivered with Brian and Sidney's story. I cannot wait for more stories in this series! 
 'Love was a risk. It was wild and unpredictable. You could either hold on for the ride, not knowing how it would end, or you could let go and never know the amazing you could've had.'

4,13872,3,"""I had to look up ""geek"" because it surely didn't mean the detailed interest of , say, a computer geek. So I learned the carnival meaning. Luckily the really gross and bloody part occurred only briefly at the beginning. The next oddity was the father deciding to produce his own freak show for the carnival (based on his seeing horticultural variety at the International Test Rose Garden). The mother dutifully took drugs to alter her offspring. Their living children were four: Arty with fins for arms and legs; Elly and Iphy, the Siamese twins; Oly, the hunchbacked, dwarf narrator; and Chick the youngest, with his special powers. 
 Had it not been a group read, I might have stopped there. However, I remembered a comment of a professor about other novels with ""grotesques"": What could the author say through them that couldn't be said through more average characters? I decided to read a bit more through that frame. Then the next chapter captured my attention with its narrative strategy of jumping into the future with Oly and her daughter Miranda. Several events are revealed that make a reader wonder how they happened. That same strategy is used a few more times, like a carrot to keep one reading. For the first two thirds of the book, the pacing was very effective. Then the notes of a reporter/participant were introduced, and while they provided important information that Oly, the narrator, couldn't have known, they dragged the pace considerably. Also the very ending of the book, while motivated, seemed to take too long. It also left me wondering to what extent it was a change in her character instead of an extension. 
 I have not yet answered the What could be said question. First hypothesis, something about disability issues. Did not hold up. Second hypothesis, something about minorities. The carnival provided a sort of ghetto where deformities were normal; however, the carnival was dependent on the money of the norms buying tickets. Oly didn't feel odd till she no longer lived in the carnival setting. 
 One group member read an interview with the author and learned she is an environmentalist and is anti-war. Perhaps the father's manipulation is an extreme of the various pollutants in our atmosphere, food, and water. And there was one paragraph in the reporter's notes where Arty ponders how people could criticize his followers who are maimed by choice and not criticize war with the injuries it produces. Maybe. And is it really choice when there is cult-like power in the leader and manipulation? I feel the need to think more on the followers' willingness to endure amputation and what it might say about other things we readers may be willing to give up and for what.""",2015-11-19 22:18:02,Geek Love,fiction;fantasy;paranormal,Katherine Dunn

Most people also didn't like the fact that the murderer gets revealed fairly early on, but the book didn't focus on who was commiting the crimes, but why they were commiting them, and I actually really enjoyed that aspect.""",2017-01-05 15:17:08,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins
7,25854070,5,"""Oh. Man. This one got me right in the feels. 
 Trevor is a successful artist in the end stage of renal disease. He's been on dialysis for the past seven years in the hopes of finding a suitable donor, but his kidney function is failing and he probably has less than a year to live, even with dialysis. He's 39 and facing his mortality. It's creeping up on what will likely be his last Christmas with his large and loving family, but his flight is cancelled when a blizzard grinds all transportation around Denver to a halt. 
 Marc is a driven attorney, hell-bent on making partner at 38. He's sacrificed his entire adult life to be the kind of son his homophobic mother would be proud of, only to note that he has no life except work. Stranded in the white out, he makes his way to a nearby hotel and books a room for the night. Seeing Trevor in the cafe, Marc is immediately attracted. His invitation to sit and join him becomes a long conversation and a further invite to share his room once Trevor confesses that he was unable to get a room due to a sell-out. 
 Neither man is really open to more than one night's solace, despite their incendiary passion. Trevor hasn't had a partner for years, and he's had even less of a libido for most of that time. Something about Marc stirs him, however. In the cold light of day neither Marc nor Trevor can admit they have more than lust boiling along, even if it's true. That said, Trevor doesn't want to reveal his illness and Marc knows a relationship will detract from his workaholic ways. Still, Marc can't abide with Trevor spending his Christmas Eve, and maybe longer, on a couch in the hotel's lobby. He invites Trevor to his beautiful and barren home outside Boulder. 
 Trevor's reluctant to let any connection build between himself and Marc, but it happen anyway. They spend a fantastic Christmas together, Trevor coming clean about his illness and prognosis when Marc presses him for more than their three day fling when he returns from visiting his family. It is bittersweet and melancholy and heart-wrenching and wonderful that these two lonely souls find a spark in such dire times. 
 I fully enjoyed the resolution to this one, which, I will state firmly, was an HEA. Marc's selfless offering of himself helped him to realize all that he had to offer others, and allowed him to break free of his self-loathing. I really liked how he engaged himself with his colleagues and found the best way to handle his very sad situation. Trevor is a man who has resolved himself on imminent death. He's afraid to hope one more, probably last, time. And it shows. He does find the courage to accept Marc's lifeline, however, and it proves the adage that life is always darkest before the dawn. 
 I just plain loved this. It's a well-told strangers-to-lovers story that doesn't ooze sap, despite the medical realities of the plot. The Christmas aspect was balanced, with high and low points--love, loss, isolation, acceptance. I will admit to shedding a tear, or three. As a person with an even rarer blood type than Trevor, I sympathized with his plight. (I may B- but I will always be positive!) There aren't too many sexytimes, but they are all about the feels. Highly recommend!

9,186074,5,"""This is one of those books that once you start reading it you just cannot stop. It was relentlessly readable. The broad outline of the plot is somewhat conventional but the way the story is told is brilliant and very captivating. 
 The protagonist of the story is a man named Kvothe. At the start of the novel Kvothe is a humble innkeeper living under an assumed name. He supposedly has a past history of great heroism/mythic adventure that has come to ruin in some way. This book is the first third of his life story that he is narrating to a Chronicler. 
 Kvothe is not a totally likable or reliable narrator and it is this continual undercurrent of distrust at the recollections of our supposed hero and the clever framing device that add a great layer to the main plot, recounting Kvothe's childhood and attendance at university. Additionally, this book is beautifully written, well paced, and endlessly intriguing. I love how this book treats magic, and the world building thus far has been great for where we are in the story. Every aspect of this world feels so real and so fascinating. 
 Solid roster of supporting characters as well. A great read. Loved it!""",2013-04-02 08:39:46,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 Part 1 in a new series 
 My Four Letter Word Review . . . 
 Let's start off with the confession that this is my first J. Daniels book that I have read. 
 I know, I know this is blasphemous but now that I have read my first J. Daniels books it definitely won't be my last. 
 In Four Letter Word we have Sydney who is a bit down in her luck where it comes to love but life won't get her down. With her re-locating to lick her wounds at her best friends house she ends up berating a wrong number on the behalf of all sisterhood. What might have been a moment of oopsie daisy ended up being a game changer for her. 
 ""WILD"" was his four letter word for ""love."" 
 Brian is just surviving. He's not really living until one fateful phone call that changes his world. Brian's stuck in the pits of hell of guilt. This guilt is causing him to make all kinds of bad choices, but something about the anonymous ranting phone call wakes him up back to the living. 
 On a whim he starts a texting relationship with Sydney. At first it was because she breathed life back into him, but very quickly she got under his skin. This should be a good thing, but Brian's recent decision making has made things difficult to have a real life relationship. 
 Sydney may have just got out of her marriage but her new phone pal sparks what has been missing for her all along. What starts out as a phone relationship turns into something quite steamy and sweet. 
 I liked the growth of Sydney and Brian together and as individuals. I loved the friendships of all the other characters especially Tori and Jamie and now I can't wait for their story, since we know its going to be a bumpy ride between these two. 
 I quite liked this book and all that was Sydney and Brian. Their was a good amount of angst without being too much with a nice balance of humor, steam and second chances 
 Can't Wait for Jamie's story and his snark.

 My Kept From You Review . . . 
 Finally we get Killian 'Kite' Kane's story. And what a story it was. Killian for me has always been the mysterious dark horse in this series. Now we find out that there was quite the reason for Killian's dark side. However, we also find out what helps tame his inner beast. 
 Savannah AKA Savvy has her own past but she always finds the good bits in everyone. This is part of the gift and curse that is Savvy for Killian. He wants her to find the good in him, but he's also tortured enough to think he doesn't have any left and he doesn't deserve any good in his life. 
 ""Because if you come near me again, next time I won't let you go."" 
 Even though Killian was young when he met his savior, he always knew the potential of her. Which is part of the reason he let her go. Now years later and Savvy has walked back into his life. This time around he won't make the same mistake twice. 
 I absolutely loved Killian and Savvy together. Savvy was a strong kick ass heroine, while Killian was the most loyal protective man you could ask for. However, they both had their pasts to contend with. 
 Throughout the years, Killian still knew what Savvy was to him and held that dear and near to his dark heart. I loved this part of Killian that he kept for her. Nashoda Rose has such a gift at creating beauty in a darker world. Kept from You wasn't nearly as dark as some of the others. Actually it had more light and hope than the others which helped balance the series out. However, it's Killian's past and fears that create the darkness within him. The guys of Tear Asunder are all near and dear to my heart and I'm so thankful we finally got Killian's story. Thankfully we have a new character in town with Trevor, whom was Savvy's neighbor and we will soon get his story as well.

 eARC for Honest Review from Author 
 Finally the conclusion to Brad and Julia. If you have not read the first two please be cautious of this review as their will be spoilers for the first two books. 
 Brad's fail safe solution of protecting Julia is with an engagement. At the end of book 2, I was thinking this engagement was out of love but I had a nagging feeling that it was only for her safety and I was concerned that Brad was going to go back to his man whore ways but Brad surprised me in this book. 
 Right from the beginning we get to realize that Brad is really all in with this relationship. He truly loves Julia. Throughout this book we get to feel and experience the depth of Brad's emotions and love towards Julia. 
 Julia loves Brad but she also wants some independence so she conforms to some notions but puts her foot down in others. She is fierce when it comes to Brad even when it comes to his family, her family, or her friends. 
 As the wedding gets closer temptations and pasts rear their ugly head. Julia's ex-fiance tries to make a dent into her plans but with his appearance it only solidifies her feelings for Brad. As Brad is trying to turn a new leaf he gifts Julia the strip club causing them to crash head on to Brad's past and potential weakness. 
 As my heart started to get palpitations wondering what Brad was going to do with temptation and I wanted to bitch slap Alexis with her antics causing me so much grief then Brad surprises Alexis and me. 
 Things are going as smooth as can be then be in the world of Brad and Julia they still find time to explore sexually, while they prepare for their wedding, evade bitchy friends and trying families. 
 Just when we think we are going to get our HEA the rug gets pulled under our feet. As Brad's world falls apart Julia fighting spirit comes to the forefront. However, not to spoil to much but we do get our HEA in the end. 
 I really did enjoy this series. It had so many different facets going on while a beautiful love story was blossoming. I loved the growth and depth of Brad. One of my weaknesses are man whores who succumb to love. It may not be the norm relationship, but it works for Brad and Julia and in the end that is all that matters. When the pivotal angst was happening in the book I did find that part a bit rushed which caused me to lose a bit of the dimension in that storyline but it didn't effect the whole series experience. 
 I am a big fan of Alessandra Torre and if you like Erotica with an edge and a little kink and drama then this is series worth the read.

 Finally, I have been in a reading funk lately with being bombarded with similar plots, formulas and story lines but this little number shook me out of it. It was different with an air of mystery and suspense in the background but still had a great love story. 
 Here we have Dahlia who has lived through a lot of sadness and loss but one constant she always had was Ben who also happened to be the love of her life. With Ben they have a huge once in a lifetime love being friends since they were kids growing into lovers and on their way to getting married....then the unthinkable happens and she has to live through another HUGE loss. 
 When Dahlia was still with Ben, she had a girls night out and during this night out with her best friend she meets a singer named River from a band who she is instantly drawn too but she does the right thing and goes back to her boyfriend and pushes thoughts of this singer to the back of her mind. 
 ""...All I know is, I was a young college girl who flirted with an insanely attractive guy at a bar and had to leave because she felt like the cosmic universe had crashed down on her. And she couldn't accept that; she had a boyfriend."" 
 Dahlia is having a hard time with the loss of Ben but with time and the support of her friends she is able to finally move on and start living again. Her first real step out into the world she runs right back into River from years gone past and their connection is as strong as ever. 
 River and Dahlia make up for lost time and their connection does nothing but grow and cements the two of them together. Dahlia has a hard time with this since these feelings are so new, different and stronger than she had with Ben but since Ben is gone she has to let go and move forward with River. 
 Now this love story is all and good and I adore it but the awesome part through the whole book is the undercurrents of secrets that you know are going to cause a world of shit for these two. There are so many elements that are going to be pulled together I assume in the next few books that can either strengthen or break River and Dahlia. But let me tell you that epilogue HOLY SHIT!!! SO was not what I expected but I LOVED that twist and I can NOT WAIT to read TORN to find out what happens with this new twist and how they play out with all the other undercurrents. 
 This books is a must read for me and I can't wait to read more from the series.

 I loved this book. I loved every character. ALL OF THEM. (well maybe expect the bad guy) All of their interactions were fantastic. I was laughing, I was heating up (if you know what I mean), I was angst ridden, I was giddy, I was so many things from this book and I can NOT wait to see what happens with Allie and her dilemma. Could be potentially delicious. 
 You heart stops with Lucas's first smirk and you love Emma the moment she face plants the ground. 
 Their coupling was against the norm and that is why I loved them. One of things that I loved was that they were a strong couple throughout the book without all the extra petty miscommunication drama and relationship angst. The drama came from outside sources and while this was happening it was only making their relationship stronger. 
 This book has tattooed, pierced bad boys who steal your heart and fun loving friends and family to make you whole. 
 Lucas will definitely be making an appearance on book boyfriend monday. *swoon*

I was taken aback at first; the rough edges of the story, the very European feel and the ridiculously unmotivated protagonist took some getting used to. When the first task was presented, I almost gave up on the book- it just wasn't what I was expecting, and the harshness of the fictional situation was a bit close to the edge for me. I am so glad I kept reading, however. By the end, I was fully immersed in Ed's story. The book is clever and touching, and this novel offers more proof that Zusak is a truly superior author- he can work magic on ordinary situations, he has a beautiful gift with language and he really makes a reader think. I also appreciate the way Zusak messed with the readers concept of the role of an author in a novel- kind of reminded me of the way he played with the readers expectations regarding a narrator in The Book Thief.

22,17950614,4,"""First I wanna say that this is one of my favorite series of all time and this book was brilliant. But, that doesn't change the fact that I had major issues with the last 40 pages (Part 6) and the ending overall. Because of those issues, I'm giving it 4 stars. 
 In this book, it is clear things are getting worse and worse. The Storks are wreaking havoc all over the country, new propositions and bills are being put forth by the government to make unwinding an even more ordinary aspect of life. And in the midst are our main characters: Connor, Risa and Lev... (and all the other characters introduced throughout the series: Starkey, Hayden, Cam, Nelson, Argent, Grace, Sonia...etc). They are all working to their end goals, some sinister and some innocent. I loved the intensity of each chapter and how perfectly they were constructed and written. The characters were great, as usual, and definitely brought me back into the world. I loved the tough choices each character had to make and the consequences of those choices. There were moments where I cried and moments where I cheered. Everything seemed so perfect.... until Part 6. 
 Leading into Part 6, we experienced some heartbreaking stuff. Everything that happened seemed like the only possible outcome... It seemed to set up the chance for other, secondary characters to take the reins... but no. That's not how Neal Shusterman decided to do it. The next bit will be in spoilers.... 
 Lev wasn't killed by the cops beneath lady liberty. Connor was unwound but put back together like the unwind legend of Humphrey Dunfee. Sure, Connor learned to be more accepting of Cam thanks to his own process of rewinding. Sure, Lev got to see Miracolina again. But here's the thing... Lev was always meant to die. He repeatedly searched for ways to feel fulfilled and only discovered that feeling when he was gunned down. I don't understand how he could feel okay about surviving. I guess having Miracolina around made things okay...? Or was it his kinkajou that made things better? :P As for Connor... I felt like his survival was okay, simply because he learned more about Cam through the ordeal. We know things would have gone okay for the country without Connor... We know that the Parental Override bill was vetoed. I guess we just had to have Connor reunited with his parents... Whatever. I can handle his survival, but I'm not okay with Lev's. 
 As for the rest, I think letting both Lev and Connor live took Grace's accomplishment out of the spotlight, and I think she deserved the recognition for her work with the printer. 
 Una's wedding was so sad and yet beautiful. And the fact that her and Cam have developed some sort of connection... just... YES! :D 
 In the end, at least Starkey died and Nelson got his just desserts.  
 It seems I am the only one complaining about the ending of the book, and the series overall. But I truly loved the book, but I wish it had ended a bit more ... I don't know... gritty? In the end I could have given it less stars for my complaints, but I really enjoyed the rest of the book, which is why I gave it 4 stars.""",2014-09-02 01:29:48,"UnDivided (Unwind, #4)",young-adult;fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime;romance,Neal Shusterman

 This is a very promising debut novel that is based highly off the authors own awe-inspiring, cross-country adventure at a young age. 
 I was so amazingly wrapped up in this story that I just HAD to stay up last and finish it. The chemistry between the characters is undeniable and genuine; it's easy to lose yourself with the time they share together, almost as if you were there. Angeli is a tremendously brave -despite her unknowing of it-- to take on the long road ahead of her alone. With each cherished friend she meets up with, she is trialed with many different choices to make, and finds pieces of herself along the way. 
 Each character you meet in this story has their own problems they face and have to deal with. I feel that not only with just Angeli, readers could relate to, but there is a character in here that everyone might feel a tad of a connection with. Angeli has witnessed so much. That connection is hard to come by in books, and I feel it is a very important bond between reader and character/author. 
 Angeli faces a lot of her own struggles before the journey and as it takes place. 
 The stress she undergoes, as well, and how she comes out stronger in the end is inspiring for anyone who just needs that little push to get up and follow their own dreams-- to live a little. 
 I love how each chapter ends with a mileage log and a page from her diary for each day, filled with important revelations and the emotions she experienced. Experiences such as being detained on the Canadian border, Ground Zero in NYC, the struggles with two boys who claim their love for her, endless! All in all, she sees that there are others out there who suffer much worse things than her in their lives, the different ways people live and their cultures. She escapes danger, and goodness, just exciting to live vicariously through these pages. I wish I could have gone through with making a trip like this. My best friend growing up and I would mention it in passing but plans just never fell through. What a great learning experience this must have been for the author. This story absolutely proves that life is what you make it. 
 In the epilogue of this story, she states that she will never know exactly who she is, or what may become of her career-- if she ever decides one at all... Well, let me just offer this, she has nothing to worry about. Her unique and refreshing storytelling is going to get her far, very far and I am excited that we were able to witness the debut of a long and beautiful career ahead of her. And I am sure that after the readers finally get their hands on this coming of age novel, that they too will agree. =) !""",2013-08-12 20:38:52,"Once Upon a Road Trip (Once Upon a Road Trip, #1)",young-adult;romance;non-fiction;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography,Angela N.

 I have never read anything by Ernest Hemingway before. I knew of his reputation, but never found the desire to pick anything up. After this book, I am really fascinated with their lives--especially hers--and I definitely have the desire to read his works. 
 One thing I loved about the books is that the author didn't feel the need to make one of them right and one of them wrong when their marriage begins to unravel. By the end you are aware of their strengths and faults and love them for it. You can see the intense personality and background to Ernest that will eventually be his undoing.

32,8683812,4,"""Maybe you have to be a Hemingway fan (or a Hemingway fan and a woman) to go for this one. I fully confess that The Sun Also Rises is one of my favorite books EVER, and I've been on something of a Hemingway kick of late. (Blame Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris, or my 2008 trip to Pamplona and San Sebastian, or the collected short story collection I gobbled up in grad school.) 
 I think if you have even a touch of Hemingway fever, you feel like squealing when Hem meets up with Gertrude and Alice, Dos, Pound and Shakespear, and of course the lovably-drunk F. Scott and Zelda. The story is told from the perspective of Hemingway's first wife, Hadley -- surely a grounding force for the time they were together, up until the point that Hemingway decided he wanted to move on. I'm no expert (I count Wiki as a source of Hemingway knowledge), but the book feels historically accurate and meticulously researched, so I have no qualms there. 
 What I do miss, though, is the Hemingway voice. While Hadley was sitting in her sawmill apartment taking care of Bumby's cough, I was a little restless. I wanted to be where Hem was, in the cafes where he banged out story after story, in the thick of the salon with Gertrude instead of to the side with Alice. 
 Still, I think it would be very difficult not to love a story that begins (or very nearly) with these words: ""This isn't a detective story -- not hardly. I don't want to say, Keep watch for the girl who will come along and ruin everything, but she's coming anyway, set on her course in a gorgeous chipmunk coat and fine shoes, her sleek brown hair bobbed so close to her well-made head she'll seem like a pretty otter in my kitchen. Her easy smile. Her fast smart talk -- while in the bedroom, scruffy and unshaven and laid flat out on the bed like a despot king, Ernest will read his book and care nothing for her.

36,1122023,3,"""Reads kind of like your standard slasher movie. 
 The opening quote on the front cover of this book simply says, 'Scream meets The Exorcist', and that is a very apt description of the novel as a whole. It mixes in the elements you will see from your typical slasher movie, but also adds a paranormal, demonic possession storyline ala Exorcist. If I was being nitpicky, I'd say it was less Scream like though, as Scream was a movie that tossed the slasher conventions on their head, and created clever twists using those tropes. This book does play it more standard, and is therefore more generic than clever in the end. Despite this however, I did enjoy this. 
 The plot line for 'The Harrowing' follows five teenagers, all from different social groups, who have decided to stay within the confines of their university during a holiday period instead of going home. While alone on campus, they make the clever horror movie decision to play with a ouija board, and chaos ensues.... 
 What I most appreciated about this book was that it actually put some though into the demonic possession angle. While the entity is of course evil, it's not simply just the devil, or a dead person with 'unfinished business'. The twists and turns kept me intrigued to the finale, and while ultimately the whole thing is a little predictable, I can at least say I was entertained throughout. 
 The characters here are pretty generic, each one belonging to your typical horror movie archetypes. We have the geek, the jock, the slut, the goth, and the supposed 'cool dude'. While the characters themselves don't stand out too much, and there's not too much to get attached to in anyway. I can say overall that I at least liked them all, there weren't any annoying characters in the group to bring the novel down and that probably ended up relating to my enjoyment of the story. 
 Overall though, this is a perfectly fun read. You won't really remember too much after you have read it, and it's certainly not going to go down as one of the best of the genre, but it keeps you entertained, and is a quick easy read, so that gets an easy 3 stars from me.""",2013-12-21 15:32:03,The Harrowing,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime;young-adult,Alexandra Sokoloff

 As someone who didn't much like 'Across the Universe', I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. 
 This novel is set in the future, after a war that devastated the world, This world has androids and reveries - where you can relive the memories you want to. Ella has a special gift of being abut the control these reveries (which were invented by her mother) and things start to get weird after she sees her dead father in them, giving her warnings. 
 I enjoyed the plot of this novel. It was fast, full of action and intrigue, and information was released slowly throughout the novel, so you didn't work everything out at once. 
 Ella was an interesting character - she's really relatable, you can really feel her grief for her father, and her confusion over all the events. I love that she doesn't lose her head automatically over the love interest character. She tells him when he's out of line, and her feelings for him grow gradually. It's not instalove. 
 Jack was a really charming character, and I would love to know more about him. I thought her mother and her dad and Ms White were well developed, but there were some others that needed a bit more depth - like Julie and Xavier, who were kind of just there.

I then turn to a completely different book in which the author explains very little, which was confusing and disorienting. In a novel which purports to be ""historical"" fiction, one does tend to expect some explanation of the setting and historical context. Fortunately, I am not unfamiliar with the Cathars or medieval France, but if I had been, I wouldn't be much enlightened after reading this nearly 700 page book. Instead, the reader is plunged into the Inquisitional terror with little or no idea of the actual conflict or why there is conflict at all. Apparently it should just be enough to invoke the Inquisition and we're immediately there - Catholics bad, everyone else, good. Interestingly, the author uses her sex scenes as tools for characterization and to manipulate the reader. They were obviously placed and obviously constructed to create an assumption about the women participating. There was very little subtlety involved. I do prefer subtlety. The second half of the book, the medieval story sort of broke down and the author appeared to have more interest in the modern story.

 On the one hand, it was an interesting and intriguing look at Hemingway before he was 'Hemingway,' the man before the legend. McLain does a great job with her characters, with her story, with her writing. I enjoyed peering into the Lost Generation in early Paris; so many familiar names before or as they made it big. And it certainly looked at how relationships can change with circumstances, in this case fame, but also the people you live with. Most married people bemoan the loss of their single friends after the wedding and again after children (or vice versa), and this is the novel of why that's not really bad. The writing is vibrating, the story intriguing, and I finished the whole book in less than 24 hours. It's an easy read. 
 And yet. I couldn't drop the feeling that I wouldn't really have cared about the novel if it hadn't been centered on the Hemingways. The story is character driven, but only because they were such characters. Much of the tale was about how Hemingway struggled to make it. And Hadley - Hadley was sweet and charming and, you know, perfect. She never did anything wrong, except maybe love and need her husband too much. Sorry, I don't buy that. Just like a marriage takes two, so does its degradation - and yes, Ernest gets the cheater blame and no one makes their spouse be unfaithful...But before that, all failures were painted as his, and I don't buy that. 
 Then, too, there were dichotomies. He loved her for her strength but without him she was weak. Even with him, she was passive if it was what he wanted. It's hard to see it both ways. Maybe that's how it ran, I haven't read anything else about their lives, but even in France with a hip crowd, it takes a strong woman to leave her husband and become a single mom, especially with no job skills, especially in 1927, especially when she was brought up classically and seemed so against the post-war movement. 
 So unlike many of the people who reviewed the novel, I can't help but think the real Hadley must have been stronger than she was portrayed. I'm interested in learning more about her, honestly, and I'm glad she ultimately found her happily ever after.

Noah's mom sounds like an absolute badass lady, and after reading this book I can see why he mentions her so often. I've read plenty of history but this is the first memoir I can remember reading that explicitly addresses some of the complications of growing up under apartheid -- it's worth reading for the history lesson alone, but Noah's heart and unique perspective on life really come through in his writing.

White did an admirable job of trying to throw in some misdirects, but they were all fairly convenient and obvious. The history White gives the main character is a somewhat interesting backstory, but I wish it had connected better to the rest of the novel. 
 The writing was really, really plain. Not one interesting turn of phrase, and if another author uses ""sign off"" so consistently to describe having ended a phone call, I will eat several hats.

57,32336119,5,"""Worth the Wait was an excellent title for this book because it was definitely worth it! Not only do we get Hogan and Violet's story, we also are treated to Nathan and Brooklin. There is even a little side romance where Colt finds some happiness as well. At first, I was hoping for Nathan to get his own story. I wasn't sure I would like both romances in one book. But both couples' stories were woven together so well that it really worked for me in the end. 
 Hogan has a lot of baggage from his late wife and for a time was not the nicest guy to women except get them in bed. Violet is fiercely independent and has worked hard for everything she has, including the diner. Between Hogan and Violet, the attraction is there, but they have a ways to go before they can trust each other. I was really rooting for them. I loved Hogan in the first book. He just seemed so lost and deserving of a good woman in his life. 
 Nathan is smitten from the beginning. He has a tough job cracking the walls around Brooklin. But she is harboring a secret, so her reasons for keeping to herself are valid. I'll let you read it to find out her secret. There does end up being a little mystery and the scene toward the end was pretty intense. 
 I highly recommend this book as well as the first one, Don't Tempt Me. Both have great characters, lots of fun banter and scorching romances that will just make you sigh.""",2017-03-27 14:46:44,Worth the Wait (Guthrie Brothers #2),romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Lori Foster

A successful book and a new TV show have her thinking that life is pretty good. But someone has other ideas. Slowly, she starts to feel like someone is following her and watching her. She starts to get threatening messages and someone drugs her more than once. The problem is that Robin thinks she knows who is doing it, but no one believes her. 
 I thought the psychological suspense was was spot on and could feel the frustration building in Robin as things begin to unravel. For the most part, I liked Robin's character. She is ambitious and likable, if a little too trusting. I just thought she made some incredibly stupid choices throughout the story. She did redeem herself in the end and I was satisfied with her growth. 
 There were a multitude of suspects in the book. I was happy that I wasn't able to figure it out early on. I like it more when I'm kept guessing and was surprised at the identity in the end. I definitely recommend this one.

Ms. Duvall has done it again. The third installment in the Immortal Guardian series was just so good. I am so loving this series and the characters. Not only are the books well written, they are filled with action, romance, humor and very hot and sexy immortals! What's not to love? 
 Bastien Newcombe has come along way from the first book. While most of the other Immortals still dislike him, they are slowly starting to trust him. Dr. Melanie Lipton wants to get to know him a lot better. I loved these two together. Melanie is a great match for Bastien. I loved her forwardness and determination. It really seemed to throw Bastien for a loop. In addition to their love story, the rest of the Immortal family plays a big part in this book. It was nice to see and have the others involved. I won't say how, but Ami plays a huge part. She is one of my favorites in the series, so I was thrilled she was in the book. 
 While the ending was a sweet HEA for Bastien and Melanie, the book left me wanting more! It's not a cliff hanger in the traditional sense, but having to wait to see how Ami's situation will play out is going to drive me crazy! I did find out that Richart is getting his own novella, In Still Darkness, in May, 2013 in the anthology, Predatory. I'll be stalking Amazon for that because it will have to tide me over until Etienne's book comes out in September, 2013.

A massive plague has hit the world (or at least southern California) taking not only Robert Neville's wife and child, but the rest of the world. He holes himself up in his house, protecting it from the vampires with garlic, crosses, and planks over the windows. He only goes out in the day, and even then only when there is no cloud cover, so that he can be home in time for dark, when the vampires attack his house. He eventually gets extreme cabin fever, driving him to drink and going mad. He tries to cope by looking into the cause of the disease when he really just wants some kind of companionship. He at one point obsesses over trying to catch a surviving, though feral, dog. I really felt sorry for Robert Neville. I don't want to give away any more of the plot, though that is really secondary to this character driven story. 
 It's rather short, only 5 1/2 hours in the audio version, which is probably a good thing. The voice actor is exceptional, with a small variety of character voices and really acts out the scenes. I highly recommend the audio version, but I am also going to have to read the novel myself as well.

 Or maybe it is about loss. 
 There is a mother who lost her son twenty years before and descended into alcoholism, deep depression and a loss of society. 
 There is a grand/father who lost his grandson and most of those he's cared about in his life -- simply through the movement of time -- who's never had the love of the daughters he loves, who needs closure and a chance to heal himself and those he's leaving behind. 
 There is a man who lost his father to an act of violence -- terrible on one hand, misunderstood on the other -- who lives a lonely existence on the alvar, being without really being. 
 There is a girl who loses the only one she ever loved, and she never even had a chance to tell him; there is a mother who lost all her sons; there is a man who lost his self-respect and his health; there is a family who lost their cohesion; there are two boys and an old man and a drunk man and an exiled man and a police man and two soldiers who lost their lives. There is deep loss in Echoes from the Dead on the Swedish isle of Oland; it is an island of victims. 
 And there is another person to consider. He killed some of those who lost their lives, or was the subject of others' losses. His actions rippled out to catalyze new actions, which created more victims. But he was as much a victim as everyone else. A man-child who never matured, a boy who wanted to be respected and be good and was at times, a boy-man who couldn't control his violence but was able to rationalize it, a lost heart who just wanted to be home with his mother. He was a victim too.

 I'm not going to write a big review for this cause you know what there's already a lot of fantastic reviews out there, what I am going to do is write some of my thoughts... 
 First of all This series has been one of my top favourite reads of all time, and this book really was the Icing on the cake. This love story has brought us full circle in that this is in 'my book' how Brad has come to realise that he is very much IN-LOVE with Julia, this is how he entwines himself in all that is Julia, how she becomes his best friend, his soul mate how they're engaged and how this year that they're planning their wedding is how they both become a whole unit TOGETHER. 
 Sexually they have a somewhat taboo relationship, and in that way this is not a 'normal' love story, I love Alessandra yet again for giving us readers something extra to enjoy, This book was erotic, beautiful and fluent I very much enjoyed the ride. As a couple they love to share themselves with an extra person, and this was an extra dimension their relationship. Saying all that , Brad is starting to feel that he didn't want anyone other than Julia but Julia just wanted to give something extra to Brad, really this has a complete feel in the final instalment, I just felt that as a couple they became Whole together. 
 I loved how Julia is feisty as ever and held herself well when confronted by Brads 'bad' mafia father, The whole protecting Julia scenario and Julia fighting strong was just another reason why I loved her and how Brad was her match in heaven they suit each other perfectly . Not only that but I enjoyed how Julia and Brad's life has changed their responsibilities are different, how Julia's friends might hold grudges but Julia became mature in her actions to the whole ordeal.

 I loved it. There were certainly very ""childish"" elements, I guess you would say, and nothing was too deep. It was, however, very thought-provoking, as the struggles the characters went through were all too real and very well explored. 
 The thing with the ""childish elements"" is that it reminded me, in a way, of a Tiger Lily book I read.. The book took place in ""The Middle of Nowhere,"" which was actually the town's name. I kid you not. With this book, it was a bit less overstated, with peoples' names like Professor Cake and Mr. Pound (POUND CAKE! It just adds to the humor a little tiny bit, without being IN YOUR FACE) 
 Also, here's something I was thinking when I was listening to this book, regarding a certain very enthusiastic woman: Ha!

 Left Drowning is one of the most incredible books I have read in a while. Ms. Park created a world with 6 amazing characters that I fell in love with and immediately adopted into my own family. On top of all that I learned she is an evil genius who likes to torture her readers wickedly, more on that later. 
 The world of Left Drowning centers on Blythe McGuire and Chris Shepherd. Through meeting Chris a lonely Blythe is wrapped into a group of friends she would never have thought she could have. Chris, Sabin (Who I am hoping gets a story of his own some day!), Estelle and Eric all bring Blythe into their intimate circle of friendship and love helping to transform not only her but them as well. 
 This world was so real and so emotionally raw for me. The magic Ms. Park wields in her ability to create a world so vivid and bold, evoking emotions in myself that are normally detached from me when reading, is astounding. Her words are so powerful I couldn't help but feel everything that Blythe felt, and in essence I became Blythe as I read and it made the experience 10x more profound than I expected. 
 The anticipation and excitement I felt as Blythe and Chris interacted was so enticing. I was feeling the butterflies and the raw sexual energy that Blythe felt. I ached for Chris to have her and was driven damn near crazy myself as I waited and hoped for that moment to come. The way the steam scenes were written with anticipation and longing heightened the reading experience and set me on fire. 
 Let me start this next part by stating I don't cry easy. I didn't cry when I got married or had my two girls which is something that I know makes a lot of people cry, heck my husband even cried when we got married. What makes me cry? Well lets see physical pain makes me cry like stubbing my toe really bad, or if someone where to hit me. I also cry when I see an animal hurt, I mean that is just horrible stuff so how couldn't I cry when an animal is in pain. 
 So anyways, there have been many books that are emotional or angsty and have made my eyes glisten with unshed tears. That is the important thing is I never dropped a tear. Well guess what, apparently Ms. Park made me stub my toe after ramming my funny bone into something hard and then forced me watch as she kicked my imaginary puppy. Why the hell did you have to be so mean to me?!?!! What did I do to you?! My word I would never have thought someone so sweet looking could be so violent and wicked! I mean she must have done all those things to me since 69% of the way through (not 70% and I don't care how naughty yelling ""69 killed me"" sounds!) a gorgeously written book I was actually crying, I mean tears coming down my cheeks and a runny nose! My heart, my poor freaking heart was in agony, I felt my chest constrict even. I was literally feeling crushed by what I had just read. I was not able to shit rainbows! 
 If that isn't talent, I don't know what is. To actually make me feel exactly as the character was feeling. I was living in the world created by Ms. Park in this book. I was Blythe. Well, of course after being made to feel like complete shit I had to keep reading until late into the night because damn it I wanted to feel better. Thankfully I carried on and soon found my heart healing, and I was able to move on which made the lack of sleep I am feeling this morning worth it. 
 This is a good long novel at 399 pages, a standalone that wont leave you hanging on a cliffhanger. All I can hope for is there will be perhaps a companion novel someday for some of the other amazing friends I made while reading this book. 
 So yes, I felt this book deserved more than the standard 5/5, it was at least a 6/5 for me. Lord only knows how many more of my imaginary puppies Ms. Park would kick if I gave her any less ;)""",2013-07-21 19:35:55,"Left Drowning (Left Drowning, #1)",romance;young-adult;fiction,Jessica Park

91,147843,4,"""Ms. Britain has written a thoroughly enjoyable fantasy epic. I know this book is well over a decade old, but the shift in writing has moved away from this style of story-telling, that slow burn that gradually percolates a story through a very long journey that leads to a final climactic ending. I liked this story a lot. It was a great place to spend a few hours in the forests of Sacordia. The characters were well thought out, the setting was perfect, and the action was intense. It was a well-paced, good fantasy romp. 
 The one issue that I had is that the dialogue was not particularly great. Conversations between characters were adequate, and conveyed the meaning of the story and the plot along its natural course. But I couldn't point to one single part of this story as being brilliant. Ms. Britain has some wonderful ideas and some intriguing concepts that are in place throughout her novel, yet there is nothing that truly sold me on her characters. None of her characters were truly stand-out or overly memorable. The setting was more engaging than the characters for the most part. I somewhat liked the king, but there wasn't a whole lot to recommend any of the characters. Karigan's father was a decent example, but he's not in the story for very long. 
 Karigan herself is a good character, but again she doesn't seem to be very developed. She's a strong personality in the story which is chock full of strong personalities, but her character herself doesn't seem well developed. Her history before the fateful encounter with F'ryan Coblebay doesn't seem well developed and she doesn't seem to change much or develop over the course of the novel in a way that makes it seem like she is a different person after this experience than she was when she began the adventure. This isn't really a negative point so much as an undercooked one in my opinion. I think this will be rectified in later additions to the series. 
 Overall, I liked the story quite a bit and look forward to reading the other novels in the series.""",2016-01-25 11:45:16,"Green Rider (Green Rider, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;fiction;romance;history;historical fiction;biography,Kristen Britain

 It was good for what it was, a prequel showcasing the Spartan's training and their 'first contact' with the Covenant and the Master Chief's first experience with Cortana.

 Oh Dante Walker, you cocky bastard, how I've fallen for your wit and charm. I'll admit, this book is not going to be for everyone based solely on our wonderful narrator, Dante. He's an ass. He's deeply in love with himself and can be quite rude or put on the full charm when needed. But I love him for all those quirks. The amount of times I LOL'd, well I don't even know. Seriously just go look up some quotes from this book. DO IT! Scott's writing and dialogue are spot on. You know what kind of person Dante is from the start. And when he meets Charlie, who is just pure nice down to her core, and she starts to point out the good traits within Dante. A little bit of his softer side starts to make an appearance. 
 Scott has created a different take on the whole Angels/Fallen Angels craze. You've still got people like Dante working for The Boss Man(hell) and people working for The Big Man(Heaven) but in a whole different way. So if you like your fallen Angel books and you want something with a different sort of narration(meaning you want to laugh and roll your eyes(in a good way)) than pick this one up.

He has earned my trust as a reader, and I will officially read anything he writes. In any genre. In any perspective. In a box. With a fox... Well, you get the point. The Name of the Wind is tied with Ready Player One for my favorite book of the year. (but possibly longer... we'll see) A Wise Man's Fear was also very good.

I got so sick of feeling sorry for Fitz that I eventually shut off my emotions to save myself the heartache.

 I really liked the stress on money in this book. The reader is constantly aware of how much of an issue it is and how poor Kvothe is. He's living from moment to moment...every decision could financially break him, which would lead to the end of his education and current life. Such a little thing...but part of daily life and a constant stress for many many people. It's interesting to find it here....I read a lot of fantasy.

 So before I begin my review, I think it would be fitting to write a letter to the author since Kandi Steiner told us a story that was aptly titled: A Love Letter To Whiskey. 
 Dear Kandi Steiner, 
 It's 2:30 am and I just spend the last three hours getting lost or in this case drunk on your lyrical and poignant prose. How can this one story consume me? Have me strangely intoxicated? Addicted? It's simple. One taste of your raw words was all it took. It didn't take much because shot after shot of your literary brilliance, you left me feeling numb, high and sated. I wanted to drown in whiskey. I wanted to feel whiskey. I wanted to be vulnerable to whiskey. I wanted to love whiskey. I wanted to hate whiskey but I couldn't because whiskey didn't consume me. It was your words Kandi Steiner that I was addicted to. 
 ""It turned out a Whiskey stain was just as permanent as ink, and I wondered if I would ever truly wash myself clean. Or if I even wanted to."" 
 This story. These characters. These words. These emotions that you had coursing through my veins was the very essence of why I love to read. This was not a story of perfect characters but instead of flawed individuals who continued to make mistakes after mistakes. Individuals who hurt each other emotionally. So how could I be intoxicated on a story where cheating occurred multiple times? The answer to that is simple. Love is complicated. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is beauty. Love is truth. And the truth of the matter, love can be selfish. Love can be cruel. Love can be an addiction. Good and bad. It can be toxic. But love can make you feel. And the story of Jamie and B was a story that I will happily drown in over and over again. Why would I torture myself in such a complicated love story? Because love is meant to be consuming and a story that makes you feel every fiber of emotions coursing through your veins is a story worth remembering. And this is one love letter to whiskey where I will savor every last drop. 
 ""My first taste of Whiskey had been nothing. My first shot? Child's play. I'd been holding back, delicately balancing on the line, afraid of drinking too much --but this was it. I knew it. I felt every inch of the fall from tipsy to drunk. I was completely wasted, and all I wanted was to feel this way forever."" 
 Sincerely, 
 ~Michelle xo 
 Emotionally consuming. Intoxicating. Raw. Flawed. And breathtakingly poignant. These are the words that immediately comes to mind as I sit here in write my review for A Love Letter to Whiskey. Kandi Steiner honestly blew me away with this book. In the three hours that I was held hostage, I felt like I was on an emotional roller-coaster going through the motions and the unexpected twist and turns. In all honesty, I needed a drink after reading this book because my heart and emotions were scattered and beating wildly as I drank in every mistake, love, hurt, and loss the hero and heroine experienced. 
 ""Jamie was whiskey, that much I was sure of. I couldn't deny the way he burned, the way his taste lingered."" 
 That first taste. Once you had your first drop of love, it's a high and addiction that you can't forget. The buzz that you crave. For Breck, her addiction came in the form of a boy who knocked her world off its axis. The boy she knew who was top shelf material. Yeah he was that drink that was rich, smooth and left a good burn. And that drink was her very own whiskey named Jamie. 
 ""I was spinning, tipsy, teetering on the edge of being wasted on Whiskey. I'd dreamed of kissing Jamie so many times, but nothing could compare to how it really felt --his hands on me, so strong, his mouth skilled and passionate. My legs were weak and he felt it, taking the weight of me in his arms, kissing me like he'd waited his entire life to have the chance."" 
 Jamie and B's relationship was built on a friendship that was held by truth, love, and an indescribable connection. To sum it up, it was intense. But like any friendship when feelings are involved, lines would get blurred. And the timing of Jamie and B was never right.When she was single, he was in a relationship. When he was ready for her, she wasn't available. But as much as the timing was never right, their feelings were always there but miscommunication and timing was always their downfall. She wasn't ready to be fully consumed with whiskey even though she already knew she was drowning in it. 
 ""It turned out I was water, he was whiskey, and I couldn't dilute him --not now that I knew he loved me enough to let me. I needed to be stronger, to be ice the next time I melted with him."" 
 A Love Letter to Whiskey is an utterly raw gripping addictive read. This book was built on a symphony of raw emotions. Emotions that left you frazzled, confused, hurt, angry, sad, and wildly intoxicated. Steiner did not write an ordinary love story but instead a story that left you savoring every drop of her poetic and stunning prose. To the very last drop, you will want a taste of whiskey. You will want to know and experience a selfish kind of love. An addictive kind of love. And most importantly a love that is honest. Real. Raw. A love that leaves you vulnerable and breathless. And so if you are ready to take a sip and get your first taste of a literary masterpiece then I urge you to get drunk on this book. Take a sip, savor the taste, and enjoy the lasting aftertaste of whiskey or in this case Kandi Steiner's words. 
 ""Even if you must move on, please don't ever let us go.""

 ****5 BRAD DE LUCA STARS*** 
 Ahhh...I'm sad that the Innocence series is coming to an end. Literally, I devoured and consumed all three books of the Innocence series plus the Diary of Brad De Luca in three days. I was addicted to Brad De Luca and Julia. I never wanted their story to end and I wanted more. Hands down Ms. Torre's writing is captivating and spellbinding. When I read the last page of the epilogue, it was bittersweet for me. I hate to say goodbye to Brad and Julia. These two are unlike any couple that I have read. Their relationship screams passionate, hot, sexy, understanding, love, and trust. Brad and Julia's relationship is not your typical norm but they are still a committed couple even though they have a sexual preference of menage. What makes this couple stand out is that there is no jealousy...they are simply confident with their relationship. Their love is so strong that not even another person can come between them. They only have eyes for each other. 
 End of Innocence picks off where it last left off in Masked Innocence. Julia and Brad are back and PASSIONATE than ever!!! Ms. Torre was able to incorporate sex, love, trust, and suspense all in End of Innocence. Julia's new found sexuality is embraced. Brad finally found the one woman who can satisfy and complete him. Together they are each other's missing piece. All loose ends from Masked Innocence were wrapped up in this final installment. Ms. Torre did not just give us an ordinary predictable love story. She took us on one hell of a sexy rollercoaster ride that I didn't want to get off. End of Innocence concluded in Brad De Luca fashion. Readers are left holding their breath if Brad and Julia can weather any storm that comes their way. Is this lifestyle Julia wants? How strong is their love? Will Julia and Brad get their HEA? 
 I loved the transformation and growth of Julia's character..the once naive heroine blossomed into a confident, independent woman who knows her sexuality. Julia is no longer blindfolded but has her eyes wide open. She knows what she loves and that is Brad. She accepts this newfound sexual exploration with open arms. As for Brad, I absolutely love him. He is sexy, confident, and the man knows what he wants. He only has eyes for Julia and she is the only one in his heart. If there ever a couple who was confident in their love, it was Brad and Julia. 
 The Innocence series has made me a fan of Alessandra Torre. Her writing is flawless, brilliant, and spellbinding. She has a way to hypnotize her readers with every word. I find myself losing track of time because I am devouring her books in one sitting. Her writing is original. Her characters are real. Emotions expressed are raw and heartfelt. Passion and intimacy was felt. Alessandra Torre did an amazing job in developing Brad and Julia's relationship. It was fun, honest, sexy, passionate, fierce, and steaming hot. Brad is unlike any male hero...his presence in the book will make any readers sigh and swoon over him. Ms. Torre will amaze and captivate you with the Innocence series. She was able to conclude the story that left me smiling. So if you haven't read the Innocence series, what are you waiting for? Go meet Brad De Luca.. Like an addict who needs their fix, the Innocence series was what I craved.

112,17325147,5,"""Left Drowning is about friendship, family, sibling love, loss, abuse, faith, hope and overcoming your past, and love. Love all the characters in the book because they felt real and believable. You felt their pain, sorrow, loss, and love. 
 ""Don't you see, Chris? You and I are supposed to be together. There is always a choice. This is not an obligation or a duty. But our lives are entwined, they have been, for good reasons. I've known that from the moment I set eyes on you. It never made sense to me before. How I felt so deeply connected to you before we'd even spoken. But I did, and I do."" 
 Left Drowning is an emotional compelling story of Blythe McGuire who lost her parents in a tragic house when she was 17 years old. Her brother, James and her were luckily able to escape and survive the tragic accident. The loss of her parents has tragically shaped and changed the lives of Blythe and James. Four years later, Blythe is a very sad, self depreciating damaged and depressed girl. She's been living in a numb, almost lifeless state until she meets The Shepherd siblings. (Sabin, Chris, Estella and Eric) 
 She meets Chris Shepherd. She feels an inexplicable connection to Chris, and he brings out feelings in her that she has long since buried. Along with Chris' two brothers, Sabin and Eric, and their sister, Estelle, Blythe is saved from drowning. They teach her to breathe again. The Shepard clan becomes the family she is missing. Along the way, Blythe reconnects with her brother James and other close family friends. Blythe learns to take charge of her life. Chris gives Blythe hope.. 
 However, Chris and his family also have demons in their past. Blythe wants to be there for Chris, to help him like he did her, but he keeps her at arms length. She makes him feel too much, makes him remember his troubled past, and he doesn't want that, he only wants to move forward with his life. They both have emotional and physical scars. Blythe and Chris past and future are connected. Although, they don't believe in faith and God but they were destined to meet each other. Their physical scars fits together like a puzzle and they were meant for each other. 
 ""I am overwhelmingly in love with you, Chris says as he matches my steps. ""I've spent most of my life thinking that my father never gave me anything but pain. But that's not true. He did give me something. Someone. You. He gave me you. Last summer, you asked me to believe in us. I don't believe in much, as you know, but I do damn well believe in us. Forever.""

118,31549837,5,"""Wow. Wow. WOW! This book was SO freaking good. 
 I am struggling to put in to words how much I loved this book. I've just spent the last two hours finishing it. Reading it nonstop because there was no way on this earth I was putting it down. The angst was off the damn charts. My heart still hasn't stopped racing. 
 ""But sometimes, even when we know something is bad for us, we do it anyway.. Maybe for the thrill, maybe to cure our curiosity, or maybe just to lie to ourselves a little longer."" 
 I had no idea what to expect from this book. Honestly, my hopes weren't that high but I wanted to give it a try anyway. I couldn't have been more blown away! The books storyline is something I'd normally shy away from because it irritates me, but I was hooked. 
 A Love Letter to Whiskey centres around the life of B and Jamie. And by life I literally means 10 to 15 years of it. Meeting as teens, these two have the craziest, most insane life together.. and apart. I loved them from the first page, and was rooting for them for the entire duration of the book. I really can't go in to too many details because this is one of those books where you just have to find it all out for yourselves, but suffice to say, this book has it all. Ups, downs, emotions, angst... everything. I was on the edge of my seat, reading at lightning speed, because I had to find out what happened next.. and fast. 
 At times I wanted to throttle the characters, bang their heads together, or just lock them in a room until they sorted their shit, but what kind of story would that be? Ultimately, everything they went through, that made me want to tear my hair out, absolutely made this book. 
 ""I think sometimes life is about embracing what hurts, because pain is one of the most vivid emotions we can feel. Pain reminds us that we are alive, and I'll always appreciate that stinging reminder."" 
 I've never read a book by this author before but I thought her writing was incredible. I fell in love with the characters as soon as I started reading the book, and I fell in love with their story just the same. This is a book that will easily make it to the top of my favourites list and I can't recommend it enough!

119,20959438,5,"""It's official.. Nicole Reed is a genius. I fell in love with her writing in her first series, The Ruining Series, and since then her writing has got better and better. Beautiful Ink was out of this world. The writing was flawless, the characters were interesting and the story was captivating. I was glued from start to finish. It has been a long time since I have fallen in love with a book and its characters, but I did, 100% with this book. 
 ""This is for those who carry a piece of their soul inked out lovingly on their skin."" 
 CHILLS. I hadn't even got to the story, just the dedication, and Nicole had already given me chills. I knew immediately that there was no way I wouldn't love this book. And then I read the prologue and I knew I was done for.. I couldn't wait to carry on and just devour the whole thing. This book takes all sorts of things I love, throws them together, and takes you on one of the most amazing rides. We've got an MC club, a tattoo artist, a hero coming along to save said tattoo artist and a whole lot of twists and turns. I loved it! 
 ""Diamond showed me the beauty that lies within the art of tattooing. If you respect the magic, appreciate the art, and forge yourself in the blood, a piece of your soul lives with another."" 
 It's so hard to talk about this book and the storyline without giving too much away. Nicole has created a story that has so many twists and turns that giving away part of it, would reveal a whole lot of the other parts. What I can say is that the way in which she has told this story is just clever. We have mixtures of past and present, different sets of characters, and we are always wondering if and when the past will catch up to the present, with everybody in one place. It was edge-of-your-seat stuff. 
 I loved every single character in this book and often felt myself torn over whether I should in fact like this character or that. There were 'bad guys', the ones we were meant to like and the ones we couldn't help but love, regardless of their actions. The situations these characters found themselves in were, at times, heart breaking. Not one person had an easy time in this book and Nicole really showed that. There were no easy choices for the characters to make. 
 ""You deserve respect and love and everything your heart desires."" 
 ""You need to live your life instead of watching it pass you by."" 
 I am so looking forward to the rest of this series, whatever those books may be about. Whether they are about the same characters, or some of the secondary characters, then I know I am going to love it just as much. Nicole's writing and story telling ability is out of this world and I feel so lucky to be reading it.

 I think I've said this before--really not sure though--but my main issue and prerequisite for biker novels is the believability factor. This is a world I'm not familiar at all, so for me to dive and get sucked in, it has to feel real to me. Obviously, this one unfortunately didn't. It had something to do with the plot, story development, character dynamics, and dialogue.

121,13449677,5,"""I love it when authors switch it up to the guys' POVs and I have to say that this has to be my most favourite among all the other novels I've read that included a guy's POV. Dante Walker is an ass. I swear, he's the cockiest, most arrogant and egotistical bastard I've ever met. And I love his bad-to-the-bones ass. 
 ""You don't know who you're fucking with, princess. Ain't no one do bad like I do.""

 Even though I'm half asleep, I wonder if she's checking me out in my boxer briefs. Then again, who wouldn't check this out? 
 ---- 
 I glance in the mirror. Surprise, surprise---I look finger-lickin' delicious. 
 If it wasn't for reminders here and there, I would've never imagined that all the things that happened in this book just happened within 10 days. Being inside Dante's head provided me a whole new perspective on what the ""reformed"" bad boys really go through once they've met THE girl. And his road to redemption and love was just oh-so beautiful and profound. 
 I couldn't even remember how many times I laughed out loud with his inner ramblings and egotistical self-praises. But what I loved most was his transition from being Charlie's corruptor to her protector. It was like I actually witnessed the wheels turning inside Dante's heart and mind whenever he goes on full attack mode against anyone who hurts and offends Charlie. At the same time, you also feel the change in him when he starts to take notice of Charlie's real beauty as well. I even teared up during that scene in Vegas when Charlie in all her drunkeness, opens up to how much she sees the goodness in Dante and he just stares at her in awe as he felt his heart slowly opening up to a whole new feeling. And then he finally falls for her... 
 I stare at the note and try to decide how to sign my name. Dante? Love, Dante? Obsessed with you, Dante? I feel like a freakin' twelve-year-old, like I'm seconds away from zits and wet dreams.

 Don't let her kiss anyone, and I'll start being a better person. I'll eat vegetables. Save baby seals.

 ""You are beautiful, Charlie. You're so beautiful, and I can't believe I let you think you weren't."" .... ""I love you, Charlie. I fucking love you so much."" 
 Charlie was the perfect heroine. She's not your typical beautiful-girl-who-everyone-adores but with her spunk and big heart, you just know that she's the perfect match for Dante in every way. I mean come on, if you managed to turn a self-centered super badass demon into a selfless and lovesick puppy, you just have to be incredibly awesome right? And she really is. 
 All the other supporting characters including grams, Annabelle, Blue, Max, and Valery, also contributed in the overall character dynamics and they really complemented each other as well. And even though Dante isn't your typical perfect swoon-worthy lead guy and Charlie isn't your usual physically-perfect girl, I still completely adore their journey together and I can't wait for the next installment in this series!""",2013-03-07 05:13:14,"The Collector (Dante Walker, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Victoria Scott

123,8683812,3,"""I'd consider this book about Ernest Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, somewhere between biography and historical fiction. The author obviously based the story on facts and real correspondence, but chose to embellish the narrative by writing in first person as Hadley. I'm not sure I understood the point of doing so. Author McLain offers little introspection into Hadley's thoughts or feelings, and Hadley comes across as one-dimensional. Even as a secondary character, Hemingway himself pulls more of the focus of the novel. Hadley seemed like an afterthought, like a companion to Hemingway's strong personality. Maybe she thought of herself that way. 
 I found the descriptions of an artist's life in 1920s Paris fascinating: philosophical conversations in smoky cafes, spontaneous trips to Spain for inspiration, and a constant fog from too much alcohol. I enjoyed reading personal accounts (albeit somewhat fictionalized) with Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. They were idealistic artists, celebrities of their time, and they were as provocative as any ""Brangelina"" celebrities of today. 
 But the setting can only carry a book so far. As mentioned, I couldn't empathize with Hadley because McLain didn't bring her to life. There's not much plot movement, other than watching Hemingway become an author and their marriage become dissolved. Hemingway behaves questionably, but I struggled more with why Hadley allows him to continue. 
 I don't regret reading The Paris Wife, and there are some redeeming qualities, but overall I didn't find it very affecting.""",2011-11-08 13:41:37,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

 Rothfuss is so good at getting Kvothe's emotions across without actually telling us what he's feeling. I love how this book falls comfortably into parts -- the part where Kvothe lives in the forest and masters the lute, the part in Tarbean, the part when bonetar nearly burns down the Fishery, the part with the draccus. It is so authentic as a story being told as a personal narrative, because it sits in my mind like that after I've read it--a story, a slice of life, with a bunch of different adventures wrapped up in it. But it has a very strong overarching narrative, and strong characters, that pull you through and keeps the parts from feeling at all episodic. 
 The part that I love best about this book, though, is the one that hasn't happened yet. The part when Kote, the mild-mannered innkeeper, becomes Kvothe again and picks back up his sword. So, if you're reading this Pat, there better be a Day 4 or a second trilogy!!

 I'm not gonna give the synopsis of this book because it's a sequel and I don't wanna spoil anything for you guys who didn't read the first book yet. 
 Expectations 
 After reading the first book of this series, (Marked), I had the following expectations of the sequel book Betrayed: 
 - A similar progression of the story already introduced in book 1; 
 - A bit predictable events; 
 - Expanding on the background of Zoey. 
 Review 
 My expectations were not quite what is going on in book 2 of the House of Night series 
 It is true that the story continues where the story ended in book 1 and there are some predictable moments, but also surprises. I find this a pleasant change within the story.There are several moments in the book that I really could not predict what would happen. 
 Personally I find it a bit hard to believe that Zoey knows exactly what they should do with the elements and how they should call on the Goddess Nyx. Everything is a going as it should be. A bit too much of a good thing. The authors show two different sides of Zoey's caracter. The one where she always knows what to do and one side where she's very unsure about herself. I find this a bit contradictory.

 The research part is probably the weakest link, as it tries to justify something that cannot be reasonbly explained with proper science. But then, it does give the protagonist something to hold on to and maintain his sanity as he tries to survive in a vampire-ridden world. 
 The ending is epic. There's no better way to describe it. 
 All in all, for a work of art written some 70 years ago, it feels remarkably fresh and modern and relevant in every little aspect. It might have been written today, yesterday, 10 years from now, it has that immortality of all great works. Again, the science piece is a bit loose, which is why one star must come off, but other that that, these are absolutely smashing 150 pages of emotional horror and class. 
 Indeed, it is a legend. 
 Remember, don't watch the film! The book is infinitely better. 
 A limerick? Can we do that? Yes, we can. 
 Robert's heart was broke and torn, 
 Even his loved ones he couldn't mourn, 
 Vampires he slew, 
 Cures he brew, 
 In the end, a legend was born.

Myles has attitude the first time he meets Brantley and Brantley gives it right back to him. Myles is surprised since he is not used to a woman actually standing up to him. First Myles has his own negative opinions about Brantley as Brantley does about Myles, but as time goes by they begin to see that what they show to the outside world is not actually what is on the inside. 
 Brantley works as a bartender at a pub, taking double shifts just trying to survive. Myles has his own secrets, but when these two meet there is an attraction and then a comfort that they both take in each other. However, something happens and then the security and faith that one character felt for the other is broken and it takes them to a different path. 
 There was a lot of unnecessary information about the secondary characters that I think could have been deleted. I did not really need to know about how Brantley's cousin, Jen and her fiance David met, etc. Then there was a lot of information about the best friend, Livvy. A little detail is fine, but sometimes a lot of information about secondary characters gets in the way of the actual plot and I lose interest. 
 Also, I am not sure if I really cared for any other the main characters. 
 This story is written in dual POV and the switch is every other chapter. I think the switch in POVs happened too quickly. There were points in the book where I had to think about whose POV I was reading. 
 The premise was there I just think that some of the unnecessary detail and frequent switch in POVs took away from the story. One thing I did like about this story is that Brantley did not back down and just accept a ""sorry"". What was done was wrong and I completely understood Brantley's words and actions toward Myles even though I could not understand why he did things the way he did. I think Brantley showed her strength in those scenes. Some of those scenes were very well written because I felt her emotions. However, majority of the time the unnecessary information took me away from the main characters.

She's more focused on her budding romance with the school outcast, Ollie, until a second murder strikes fear into everyone in town. Maybe Makani lying so she can spend more time with Ollie is putting her in even greater jeopardy, since she might be next on the killer's list. She hasn't told anyone the reason she moved from Hawaii to Nebraska, and the killer seems focused on offing students who stand out in some way. 
 I know 3 stars seems like a low rating - I think I might have had my expectations too high for this book. At the Boston Teen Author Festival a couple of weeks ago, one of the authors was talking about subverting tropes and how this novel didn't, it was just a perfectly executed thriller. So I knew going in that there wasn't going to be a twist at the end, that it was a straight teen slasher novel. There are definitely some wonderfully creepy moments, which scarily resemble one of my worst nightmares, wherein the victims discover common objects in their homes moved around. It's definitely a great thriller, and the pace kept me turning pages. 
 In relation to the trope conversation above, I think there are a lot of young readers who have never read a straight thriller, and so for them this is new, but for me this is simply a better-written version of the R.L. Stine and Christopher Pike novels I devoured as a teen. Honestly I kept waiting for a twist, especially after they figured out the identity of the killer about 60% of the way through the book. The hot pink of the cover text and book design led me to believe the killer had to be Ollie, who has pink dyed hair . For some reason, the movie ""Scream"" kept coming into my head, and I figured there would be two killers. I also expected, from the title, that the grand finale would happen inside Makani's house. It happened in a haunted corn maze, which was fantastic, but again I just expected something different . I also expected, after Makani reveals the reason she left Hawaii, for that to somehow come into play. The killer's reasoning felt a little weak and I wanted it all to be more connected somehow, more so than it was. 
 So, I am giving this three stars because it was enjoyable to read and well-written, but didn't do anything new for the genre.""",2017-01-09 06:29:02,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins

 Fall of Reach is a prequel to the original Halo: Combat Evolved story and gives amazing insight on how John 117 came to be. He definitely has more of a personality in the book, so it was good to actually see that. 
 As the title of the book indicates, this story goes into detail about the events leading up to when The Pillar of Autumn jumped into slipspace and escaped literal destruction from the devastation of Reach. Reach is the biggest military base humanity owns, and they fight valiantly, but the Covenant is just too powerful. They come full force at the planet and The Pillar of Autumn narrowly escapes.

 My brother loved this book. My brother usually has the same taste in dark fantasy as I do, but I just could NOT like The Name of the Wind. 
 It had a lot of great elements: red headed main character who is smart as a whip, the traditional hero's journey, an interesting love story, and a fascinating world. 
 Those elements just didn't add up. The writing was great. The MC was an asshat. Seriously, this guy is a total freaking idiot and that's okay. I mean, I love characters that learn over time, that change and grow. Kvothe did not change or grow. Basically, he just stayed a poor, vicious street orphan from the time his parent's kick it and throughout his entire college experience. 
 GOD, the stuff going on between he and Ambrose is just DUMB. I mean, sure, the first few times were funny. But it's like he didn't learn that lesson AT ALL. He just kept kicking that dead horse again and again and again. To my utter annoyance. 
 The other thing that doesn't thrill me, and this is just personal taste... I hate stories told backwards. I hate when the main character goes back to tell a story that happened in the past, because there isn't a lot of tension there. If the MC is telling the story, then you know they live. And you know that there's nothing at stake, really. I like life and death. I like worrying about my characters and feeling like I have an emotional attachment to the moment. It was really hard to get drawn into the story because of the way it is told. 
 That being said, the best part of this book is when he goes to audition at that musicians hangout. (Can't spell it to save my life, so I won't bother.) I was literally holding my breath that he'd make good. And he did. But then he ruined it completely by being an asshat and I pretty much lost interest after that.

 The Body Electric is set in the same universe as Across the Universe. There are many great references to Beth Revis' trilogy, and I absolutely love all those easter eggs. It brings back great memories and tempts me into reading those books all over again. 
 Ella Shepherd is desperate to hold onto her dying mother. Her mother, dying from a (thankfully fictional) disease called Hebb's, is barely surviving. (Note: I get nightmares and shivers from the way Revis describes the disease.) Ella is a seemingly normal girl whose parents are well-known among the science community. But one day, she jumps into her mother's tech-induced dream and changes everything in her life. Suddenly, Ella is thrown into a war she'd never heard of. What I love the most about Ella is how much she is tested and how well she manages to rise above it. No matter how far she is crushed, she strikes back. 
 Every character has its own agenda. The leader of the corrupt government is searching to crush the rebel group. Ella is searching for answers (about Jack and about the dangerous mystery). The leader of the rebels is focused on Ella, and I love how every character has its own purpose, their own (gloomy or bright) personality. Even their own dialect. It makes every character unique in their special way. 
 The plot unravels slowly, almost lazily. Ella undergoes a normal day, and readers are given a chance to see Ella's attempt at normalcy. Suddenly, a spark flies and everything changes. Ella discovers ""old"" friends, and she finds more questions than answers. I'm absolutely emotionally invested in Ella's search for the truth. I'm swept away into Ella Shepherd's world and her vast number of problems, and I ignore everything in my world. 
 The romance between Jack and Ella is very entertaining. Ella, after being mind-wiped by a mysterious and unknown person, meets Jack at her deceased father's tree. Thinking Ella still remembers him, Jack says and does the wrong things and scares Ella. Good amounts of drama ensues, and I love the way Ella slowly falls in love with Jack (again). 
 Overall, The Body Electric is a pulsing Science Fiction story that is perfect for fans of Across the Universe and Legend (by Marie Lu). With dark descriptions and many strong characters, The Body Electric is simply amazing.

Dreams and duty. Each and every book was always starring a war within Katerina Alexandrovna along with the war between someone. 
 Okay, that clears up a lot of the issues. The Morning Star is an okay book. Disappointing, because its predecessors fared so much better like The Unfailing Light and The Gathering Storm. The Morning Star, compared to the last two, didn't go into many details and wasn't as good. 
 The plot went by very quickly. Sometimes, in the middle of the book when I was reading it, I wished that the author would slow down a bit because everything went by a little too quickly. Like she was here, then there. And whoa! How did she get there? It's something like that along the lines. Crazy. Fast-paced. And insane, but overall landed on my positive thoughts. But disappointing was one of the negative thoughts on The Morning Star. 
 I like how the author did little recaps here and there, but I wish she expanded on them, because I can't remember everything about the last two books. Hello? That book was about two hundred, or four hundred books ago. It might as well be eons. 
 The ending. This is me for the entire ending: (O.O) Yes, that's correct. That face right there. For the entire ending, I was shocked, shocked, shocked. Then I was, what the heck did I just read. But of course, I'm not telling you anything, but it is worth reading the last part because it is just that good. And I'm left thinking that Robin Bridges should write some more of this series. 
 Katerina Alexandrovna never was and never will be my fav heroine. I never found her as interesting as Katniss Everdeen, or June Iparis. She wasn't as broken; she was like a perfect doll. Sorry, Katerina, but your sob story doesn't sell.

 Five stars are not enough for this book! 
 I finished Left Drowning three days ago and I am still literally at a loss as to what to say about this book. No words that I can type could ever give this book the justice that it deserves. This book resonated so deeply within my soul that I will never forget a single moment of it, and I don't want to. Jessica Park did an amazing job in bringing every emotion I could ever possibly feel to the surface. She took my heart, ripped it out of my chest, stomped on it, stabbed it, and tore it apart. When I didn't think it was possible, she repaired my heart in the most beautiful fashion and I finished this book with the cheesiest, largest grin that could ever grace my face, while crying tears of joy at the same time. Seriously. This. Book. Is. Incredible. 
 Blythe and Chris have undeniable chemistry that sizzles through the pages. The way that they are immediately drawn to each other is beautiful, as is the progression of their relationship. They truly are each other's saving graces. They're like puzzle pieces; they're meant solely for each other to create the perfect fit. I can't begin to form the words to express how much I love the relationship of Blythe and Chris. 
 At one point Chris utterly and totally destroys me and I was left wondering... 
 Blythe's strength as she continued to heal was extremely admirable. She's now at the top of my list of favorite female heroines. I felt everything she did. I felt her pain, her sorrow, and her angst. I also felt her falling in love, her pain healing, and the familial love she felt for Sabin, Estella, Eric, and James. She may have been a zombie for the past four years, but with a little bit of help, she rejoined the land of the living, and I loved going on this journey with her. 
 I also need to give a special shout out to Sabin. He was probably the best secondary character that I've ever encountered in the literary world. He was just as important of a puzzle piece in putting Blythe back together again. He was the instigator, the push, the spark that she needed to begin living her life again. He was her person. And it was undeniably beautiful. 
 I read Left Drowning on my birthday, and I'm pretty sure I freaked my husband out. If there's ever a book to make you ugly cry, this one is it! After crying on the couch for over an hour, I made my husband go to the store and buy me a bottle of wine because my heart seriously needed some liquid courage to continue this story. Jessica Park's writing style is so effortless, and she writes in such a way that the characters pop off of the page and instantly grasp onto your heart. I connected with this book in a way that I haven't experienced in a very long time. 
 Don't let me scare you with my talks of all the crying and emotional wreck that I was while reading this book. This payoff is more than worth it in the end. If you take only one recommendation from me for the rest of my blogging life, Left Drowning needs to be your choice. I'll even mail you a gift package of Kleenex tissues and chocolate to help you cope. I'd send wine, but I'm not really good at sharing that. I'll even send a few free hugs your way. You're going to need them. 
 Amazing, heartbreaking, devastating, tear-inducing, beautiful story.

 Rating: 
 Dante Walker. He is one annoyingly hot, funny and arrogant guy. I honestly can't decide whether I would like to knee him in the groin or kiss him. However, what I can decide is that he was the perfect protagonist for Victoria Scott's amazingly original take on the whole heaven-hell-angels-demons genre. Dante basically helps Satan (or Boss Man, as referred to by Dante) collect the souls of humans who are major sinners and he doesn't mind - not a single bit - as it does have many benefits. 
 Although Dante does seem like your run-of-the-mill bigheaded bad boy, he's undoubtedly good at being one. He's got plenty of attitude and definitely seems completely carefree and self-absorbed. However, the little glimpses given into Dante's life before he died and started working for Boss Man revealed a surprisingly human and hidden side of him. 
 Despite the fact that Dante never felt remorse for taking others' souls and dooming them to an afterlife in hell, his newest assignment, Charlie Cooper, became a catalyst for his change of views. The main reason being that Charlie is an all-rounded good girl and Dante usually collect souls that aren't so angelic. Saying she was a breath of fresh air to him would be a crazy understatement. 
 I did love the vast difference between Charlie's and Dante's characters and that Charlie could see right through Dante's big personality. However, I felt her innocence was a tad overdone and at times it felt slightly unnatural, making it a little uncomfortable to read and process. 
 The uniqueness of Victoria Scott's adaptation of the whole heaven and hell/angels and demon theory made The Collector an utterly unpredictable read. It was so much fun discovering how things worked in Dante's reality and I would say this book was a favorite of mine in the YA paranormal genre. In fact, the pacing was also impeccable and I actually finished The Collector in 3 days, which was lightning speed for me as I read like a snail. 
 To sum this up, The Collector was hilarious, well-paced, original and had such touching yet fun romance. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, The Liberator, (hopefully) soon. But I do wish that Charlie will be a more realistic and believable character in the sequel while Dante... he can just keep being his obnoxiously attractive self. If you're looking for a quick, not-too-intense read, I would definitely recommend this!""",2013-09-01 06:08:13,"The Collector (Dante Walker, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Victoria Scott

178,186074,5,"""If I could give this book another five stars, I would. 
 There are few things in life that I treasure more than a fantastically written piece of fantasy. 
 This book happens to be one of them. 
 The impetus that led me to read this book started with a decision to make a concerted effort to find something new to read. I was in fantasy book limbo. I had not started a new series in a few years - and those I've tried largely fell flat by book two - and was instead stuck in a circular habit of re-reading old favourites. 
 Which led me to a list on the internet that in so many words, listed the best fantasy books of all time. 
 Many of those books high up on the list already were on my 'read' list. This was the exception however, a revelation that intrigued me enough to start considering adding it to my 'to read' list. 
 As fate would have it, by about the time I decided to seek it out, I found a copy in a second hand book store, too good an opportunity and too fortuitous a find not to purchase it and start reading it. 
 And so this was the beginning of something very special. 
 The characters are interesting, the story-telling is sublime and the concept is familiar to fans of fantasy, both in a coming-of-age sense as well as in the trials and tribulations of one's life journey. And yet somehow it still managed to largely avoid the heavily cliched tropes of fantasy that has since mostly exhausted the genre (and its fans) to a point of almost severe aversion. (And is a large reason why I ended up in fantasy book limbo to begin with) 
 The world-building is fantastically magical but not so much to lose its sense in its own spell. Somehow it stays fundamentally grounded on ""human"" logic that makes it believable enough for those who have grown ""attached"" - for lack of a better phrase - of the grittier realisms of George RR Martin. In doing so, it makes it immediately attractable to all degrees of fantasy fans. 
 It is not devoid of its dark moments - with darker to come if foreshadowing indicates anything - but it is at the heart of the book a rather wry tale told with an underlying humour. I would go so far as to say it is almost a bit sarcastic, as if the book is attempting not to take itself too seriously. Which simply adds to the character of the tale as a whole. 
 It is a book I would recommend again and again to anyone who asks for a book recommendation in the genre (and even outside it). It is something that I would freely converse and debate about to any who'd care to argue the merits of the story and the setting. 
 Ultimately, the book in of itself is more than just the beginning of a story, it is the beginning of a great many wonderful things. 
 And is a gloriously written introduction to the world of Kvothe and the wit of its writer Patrick Rothfuss.""",2012-07-01 23:54:38,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

181,186074,4,"""This book is so close to five stars it kills me. 
 Easily the best high fantasy book I've read since Game of Thrones, or when younger, books like LOTR. Basically, it's up there. 
 The first 70% of the book I could not put down. The lyricism of the first page had me entranced. Some of the most beautiful writing ever: 
 'He moved with the subtle certainty that comes with knowing many things. The Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn's ending. It was heavy as a great river-smooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.' 
 I read the prologue and thought Yes this is the book for me. It's gorgeous. It's the story of Kvothe, who we meet when he is being an innkeeper, but that is not who he truly is. 
 I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe Kingkiller. I have earned those names. Bought and paid for them. 
 But I was brought up as Kvothe. My father once told me it meant ""to know."" 
 I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned. 
 I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. 
 You may have heard of me. 
 I can't even. This book is awesome, and is the story of Kvothe telling his own story. He is upfront about the fact that stories are embellished or changed etc. which I loved. An unreliable narrator is an interesting one. 
 But what is excellent about this book, well from what I've tried to work out anyway- is how real and raw it is. 
 This is a story, but it's a story of a man's life. It doesn't have to have direction or purpose. He has a promising start but has his future warped by tragedy and murder. 
 ""Think of all the stories you've heard, Bast. You have a young boy, the hero. His parents are killed he sets out for vengeance. What next?"" 
 Bast hesitated, his expression puzzled. Chronicler answered the question instead. ""He finds help. A clever talking squirrel. An old drunken swordsman. A mad hermit in the woods. That sort of thing."" 
 Kvothe nodded. ""Exactly! He finds the mad hermit in the woods, proves himself worthy, and learns the names of all things, just like Taborlin the Great. Then with these powerful magics at his beck and call, what does he do?"" 
 Chronicler shrugged. ""He finds the villains and kills them."" 
 ""Of course,"" Kvothe said grandly. ""Clean, quick, and easy as lying. We know how it ends practically before it starts. That's why stories appeal to us. They give is the clarity and simplicity our real lives lack.' 
 I can't finish this review now. I will in a few days. Just- read this book.

 I am a huge fan of the Argeneau series. I love the uniqueness of Lynsay Sand's version of vampires. I have this thing for authors that use different ways of depicting vampirism. The Argeneau series is fun and always easy to read. As many of the books that I have read it hasn't gotten old yet. It is one of the few series that I usually purchase the day that it comes out. That's saying a lot if you ask me. So if I'm such a huge fan why on earth am I reviewing book 1? Because I felt like reading something like the Argeneau series and after failing to find something recommended that I haven't read already I decided hell I'll just re-read this one! 
 What shocked me almost from the start is that I barely remember this book. I originally read it almost exactly 2 years ago. This story is about Lissianna and Greg. It's sort of an introduction to the Argeneau. There are some things not included in this book that must have evolved some to the series in later books. It features my favorite matchmaker Marguerite Argeneau. She is the mother of Lissianna and she kidnaps Greg to help Lissi with her phobia. Lissi is a vampire that faints and the sight of blood. Just that premise lets you see how comical these books are. But they are also very romantic as well. It was really fun reading about characters from later books such as Thomas, Mirabeau and Jean Louis. 
 Although this is a good introduction to the Argeneau's I wouldn't rate it as my favorite book in the series. I would have to say that award would go to Marguerite's book. It's still a great book and I love Lissi and Greg. So if you like vamp books and are looking for something different than this might be for you! Just keep in mind it is meant to be humorous. I get sick of reading reviews for this series giving it a hard time. If you like the Love at Stake series you will love the Argeneau.

 When I started this book, I did not realize how dark this book would turn out to be. It is told mainly through the eyes of Oly who is older now and no longer traveling with the circus.

Arty gradually becomes something of a traveling evangelist, becoming the leader of a strong cult following of people who yearn for something else from their lives - something out of the ordinary, the need to belong to an exclusive group of those who do not belong in the normal world. Arty has a pathological need to control others along with a maniacal ego that will stop at nothing - at NOTHING - to make sure those around him always do his bidding.

Didn't know which one to start with I chose this one because the synopsis did sound really good. This review has a ton of spoilers in it so fair warning now. If you really want to read this book and don't want to be spoiled and know important plot elements please don't read below. 
 **************** 
 We have Charlotte a protagonist I really liked mostly because she was a damn mess and it's really refreshing to see a main character in her twenties who doesn't have her life together. Charlotte meets Adam and they have a really weird and sweet night together. When we are first introduced to Adam he seems kind of spacey. He doesn't remember much. I figured this might be like a 50 first dates situation where he has a short term memory problem. After spending the night together Adam is weirdly pissed at Charlotte and she leaves. Charlotte then joins match.com meets a nice guy there and he stands her up. Flash forward six months. She meets match.com guy again who is a hot baseball player. He's super boring and I don't really care about their relationship but I'm sticking around to see what happened with Adam. Charlotte goes on a wild goose chase and eventually meets his neighbor who in turn tells her Adam has a brain tumor and is currently dying in a hospital. 
 This is where I start to not like this book. And here is my very long list of reasons: 
 1. Cancer as a plot device. 
 That is so overdone at this point like can we not? Didn't Nicholas Sparks already beat this dead horse enough? I also really hated that that was like a twist. If I had known going in that this was a cancer book I wouldn't have read it. Both my mother and my grandmother died of cancer so I have a really hard time romanticizing it. 
 2. Manic pixie dream boy. Oh, my god! Adam was the epitome of the MPDB. He was spontaneous and weird but he's also hot and rich and in his final days he takes Charlotte to France and teaches her to sail and they fly on private jets and have an on-call doctor. Um...seriously? Like I said romanticizing cancer. Also I felt like the only purpose Adam served was to develop Charlotte so she can 'find her way. Like wtf? 
 3. The other dude. So like at first I was indifferent to him. He seemed fine but I knew he wasn't the star of the show here so I didn't get attached. But then after the dude dies she meets this guy again and oh they get married...awww. Are you kidding me? 
 I honestly do not know the point of this book. I really regret reading it. I wish I hadn't wasted my time.""",2017-05-09 16:07:40,Wish You Were Here,romance;fiction;young-adult,Renee Carlino

She hoped the one thing she cherished the most, her Grandmother's rose ring, could be saved but it was very valuable and was also sold. 
 The lawyer has a plan for Fiona, though, to help her to earn back her ring. If she will sign the contract, she is needed as a live in helper to a reclusive man. Fiona will do anything to get the ring back so she signs on the dotted line without hesitation.

 The Collector is book one in the Dante Walker series by Victoria Scott. I was first introduced to Ms. Scott when I recently read Fire and Flood and immediately fell in love with her and vowed to go back and read this earlier series. And after I finished this first book I can say that I was most definitely NOT disappointed. 
 Dante Walker is a collector. He collects souls for the Boss Man that lives ""downstairs!"" Dante lacks nothing in the self-confidence department. He's good at his job and he knows it. But his latest assignment is the biggest of his two year career. He has been given ten days to collect the soul of Charlie Cooper. If he completes this task, he will get to stay ""above ground"" for good. No more fiery pits of hell. And he has complete confidence that he will complete this task. His future depends on it. Charlie will be putty in his hands, or will she?! 
 Charlie Cooper is good. She has a pure soul. When Dante first meets her, she is not at all what he expected. She's a tiny little thing and a total nerd. She has frizzy hair, walks with a limp and has crooked teeth. But as Dante gets to know her, he realizes that Charlie's beauty is within. But, he cannot figure out what Boss Man wants with this girl. Still, no matter the reason, he is committed to getting Charlie to give up her soul. 
 ""I like the sound the world makes,"" says Charlie. 
 ""But as I watch Charlie listen to her favorite station, I realize she has something most never will-peace."" 
 So when I first met Dante, I saw what he wanted everyone to see, a guy that is confident, cocky, and gets what he wants. But as I got to know him better, I fell in love with him. I saw the reason for his actions. And once Dante commits himself to something, he does not waver. At first it was to complete his assignment. But as he got to know Charlie his loyalties change. And when Dante falls, he falls hard. 
 ""My heart throbs, and I know it's over for me. I'm done. Putty in her hands."" 
 This book has everything, quirky humor, some heart pounding action, plenty of good guys and bad guys, and some of the sweetest moments. The two main characters won me over immediately. But we have plenty of fantastic secondary characters as well. Dante's best friend, Max, Charlie's two best friends, Annabelle and Blue, and Valery who is a Liberator which is what the soul collectors that work for the Big Guy upstairs are called. 
 This is a fantastic first book for this series and I can't wait to see what's next for Dante and Charlie.""",2014-01-28 06:14:21,"The Collector (Dante Walker, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Victoria Scott

Because Temeraire is naive but intelligent, she has the opportunity to question all the wrongs of Regency British society and colonialism, and to defend them according to the beliefs of the time.

Brilliant stuff, deeply layered and truly thoughtful. I want to downgrade everything else, in order to give Novik more stars.

 **Potential Spoilers** 
 So I really hate to be the odd man out but I really did not like this story. It wasn't the story necessarily but Blythe's love interest Chris who slowly killed it for me. I know, I know, so many loved him but I just saw him as weak which is odd considering how strong he had been to take care of his siblings and survive his childhood. 
 ""Chris has the same unromantic view of the world that I do. I suspect that neither of us wants predictable march through life that includes things like marriage, kids, and a white picket fence. We both have histories that preclude wanting to seek out tradition.""- 
 Blythe 
 Blythe lost both her parents in a horrific accident. Since then, she's barely lived, doing only what she needs to survive but not enjoying life. She certainly has suffered like no teenager should ever have to. She carries a tremendous amount of guilt in regards to her parents' death and an injury that her brother suffered, that same fateful night. Years have passed but slowly Blythe begins to arise from the ashes. Much of this is thanks to Chris and his family, my particular favorite is Sabin. 
 The Sheperd family is just what Blythe needs. Having been alone and in her self-imposed hell of torture she has forgotten what it's like to live. They bust right into that shell and pull her out kicking and screaming. Her normal weekends would consist of binge drinking and fooling around with guys but only to the point of her turning them away when things started going too far. How could she let someone see her scars, both physical and emotional when she can't stand them herself. But the Sheperds give her not only fun and happiness but love, something that's been missing from her life for too long. And the feeling of family and belonging is not something Blythe ever wants to lose now that she's gotten it back. 
 ""There is nothing like trauma to make you see the world clearly, and not that I know there is no God, I cannot go back."" 
 -Blythe 
 I did not really like the story at all, the plot was interesting enough and I enjoyed the banter between the Sheperds and their family but at some point it became too much. Blythe was an admirable character and she was interesting to read about, but the whole romance with Chris was sort of a letdown. And Chris, I couldn't like him, I found him too weak. (To everyone who read and loved Left Drowning, please don't throw things at me.) Sure he had a shitty childhood but for someone who took the brunt of the pain in order to shield his brothers and sister, he didn't seem to have any sense of self-perseverance. In fact he seems to purposely think he is not worth anything even considering how far he has come. At one point in the story Chris became a monumental ass-hat. In my eyes and I could not get over the fact. It's one things for a weak heroine but Blythe who has been suffering with her issues for years manages to overcome then in a seemingly small amount of time whereas Chris doesn't even bother to try. I think at some point too it just kept going when it should have ended. There were some minor time jumps that I felt took me away from the story a bit but it wasn't far enough to thoroughly disconnect me. 
 So there were a few saving graces in Left Drowning. It was not a DNF for me but I few times I waved my kindle around hoping the end would be near. 
 Number one on my list is Sabin who is Chris's brother. She actually meets him first and every time he is just a joy to read about. When we first meet him I was excited thinking he was Blythe's love interest in the book. Chris was nowhere near as awesome. Let's just hope Sabin gets his own book and soon. 
 ""Dude, get a grip. And don't date anyone whose name sounds similar to mine. It's creepy.""... ""Well, shit, I hadn't thought about that. Chris, Chryslte... Oh, the tragedy! Clearly I cannot make juicy love to a woman ever again, for I would only think of you, dear brother. And that would be a sin of outlandish and vile proportions."" 
 - Chris and Sabin 
 The rest of the Sheperd family was pretty awesome. 
 Blythe's boldness in taking charge of her life-very commendable. 
 Chris is really a powerful motivator as long as he is not focused on himself. He pushes Blythe to her limits, making her face every horrific moment in her past in order to conquer her future. 
 I was shocked by the turn around with her brother and the truth he kept hidden. But it was bittersweet to see them work everything out and move past the accident without pointing fingers and forcing self doubt on each other. 
 I loved how bold Blythe became once her inner sex vixen was unleashed. Let's just say this girl has no problem letting out her inner slut when the time calls for it. 
 Blythe really grows throughout the story. She develops into an even stronger character. I was surprised by how forgiving she could be in both circumstances revolving Chris and her brother. 
 Another thing I didn't like was how everything seemed to work out so perfectly. I mean the world is not that small. But of course there is a connection between them that goes back, ugh, I just couldn't believe it. It was all too unrealistic for me. As soon as I heard the story from Blythe I knew there would be an almost unbelievable connection between the two. And as a Jessica Park fan it pains me to say that. 
 In some ways Left Drowning, drowned me with monotony and un-believability in almost 400 pages. I know, I really hate to say it but I felt let down after being sucked into the story and somewhere along the way my enthusiasm just drifted. 
 Overall 
 This story was really just a step above OK for me. I couldn't stop reading at the same time I couldn't stop disliking some of the characters more and more. I can't argue that Blythe is one strong heroine and makes the story bearable, as well as the rest of the Sheperds but I was disappointed by so many minor plot points that they were all I can focus on. I am desperately hoping Sabin gets his own book so I can jump back on the Jessica Park bandwagon because Left Drowning was just not my cup of tea.""",2013-03-13 12:50:05,"Left Drowning (Left Drowning, #1)",romance;young-adult;fiction,Jessica Park

217,2407022,3,"""Overall, I would have to say that I really liked the idea of this book, but I think the execution suffered a bit. The beginning, where Carmen and her family are moving to Mars and acclimating, is given so much room to breathe it feels slow. About a third of the way into the book I was still waiting for something to happen besides Carmen narrating the minutiae of her life. It also reminded me too much of Heinlein's ""Podkayne of Mars"", but wasn't similar enough to benefit from the comparison. Carmen isn't as smart as Podkayne, and her brother is just sort of there in the background rather than being a sociopath. Her parents are almost nonentities and the other secondary human characters are very shallowly drawn. 
 The plot twists and exciting moments are almost afterthoughts, in some cases literally. The book is narrated from the future, and at the end of nearly every chapter is a sentence-long description of whether what the characters thought at the time turned out to be right or not. A clever device, if used properly, but at the end of every chapter it just exhausted me. 
 And the climax of the book is almost literally an afterthought, a lazy attempt to wrap up the loose threads of the story. More time is spent on the details of how one would attempt to get her bachelor's degree via VR headset from a spaceship and another planet than is spent on the supposed crux of the book's plot. 
 But still, I liked the ideas presented, and I liked the author's take on a ""Martian"" race as well as a first contact scenario.

 This sat on my kindle waiting for me to read for a few months, but I finally got around to reading it. I knew up front it was going to be a 'hard' read(as in emotional roller-coaster.) There were parts I simply skimmed through and usually I'm hung on ever word by her. Not this time. 
 We pick up a few years later when we start. Rob and Matty live in NYC and are in love with each other. But both of them have issues. Matty's is his eating disorder. It controls his life and he only feels 'free' when Rob does a hard reset with him. Something Rob doesn't like, but will do to help Matty. Rob will do anything to help Matty, but he needs help himself. 
 Matty is coaching now and his star pupil is moving up the ranks and thus is moving to get more intense training from a well known coach. Matty's boss, Valentina is constantly putting him down, which isn't helpful. It's like a wound and she keeps ripping off the bandages before it has time to heal. 
 Rob is working as a physical therapist and well he loves his job, there are factors he doesn't love. He feels trapped. He hates the city life, it constantly puts him on edge and fantasies living on the open land again. He doesn't tell Matty any of his stressful worries though, because he feels Matty has a lot on his plate already and as his Dom he needs to just suck it up. He finally as an acquaintance (who happens to be living the BDSM lifestyle AND is a sports psychologist.) who gives him some advice. 
 Their stress levels reach an all-time high and bubbles over causing Rob to  say his safe word . 
 In the end everything is working out for them and they are both much happier than they have been in a long time. 
 Okay, so there was a part in the book where Rob takes Matty away for a mini vacation and there was one thing I couldn't get out of my mind. They go for a horseback ride to have a lovely picnic and all I can think about is...  Is Matty in the nude? Because Rob told him no clothes for the whole time... and if all I can think about is that must have been pretty uncomfortable for him...  
 I feel the author did a very good job with researching about Matty eating disorder and with Matty's inner thoughts, portrayed it well. I feel she did well with Rob's emotions trying to deal with until he breaks himself because there is only so much one can handle by themselves.

 I just wasn't into this story as much as the first one. I did have some expectations going into this story. I wanted it to be as good as the first. Sadly, in my opinion, it did not. I really(still am) trying to root for team Tyler and his ex...Mitch... look, I can't even remember stunt man's name. I remember his ex wife's name(yup he was married) Julissa. She had more of an impact than he did. 
 Edit: His name is Memphis. See, I was wrong and I just finished this story today. He doesn't light my fire... though... that elevator scene was super HOT. 
 Okay, so Tyler's first boyfriend was his roommate from college. They even got their own apartment together. Then one day Tyler comes home to find him gone. Vanished, without a word. Nothing. Well, Tyler of course was devastated and played the 'what if' game. What did he do to wrong? His ex became a professional model/ stunt man. Fast forward ten years. The tabloids get Tyler's name. News is out, stunt man is bi and had a boyfriend ten years prior. Then the questions circulate. Did Tyler make stunt man straight?!? He goes and confronts him. 
 Stuntman, aka survivor of cancer twice, is a professional adrenaline junkie. He walked out and away from the love of his life ten years ago. Still, he allows cancer to control his life. He even made a bucket list. He was married, but divorced his wife, who happens be to his business partner. He got issues he needs to work out. He would love to be able to explain and get Tyler to forgive him. Stunt man, I just really didn't like him that much. I feel bad that about it, but I simply not loving him. So, here is the gist of what is going on  he finds a lump on his neck. Cancer. He doesn't want it confirm him. He doesn't want to go through it again.  He wants to just live life to it's fullest. But he can't because he is being held back  because of his cancer . 
 Tyler isn't the same man he was ten years ago. He is more confident and in control of his life. He fights his attraction for his ex as long as he can... but even afterwards he needs to push his ex to do the right thing. His ex keeps running away but this time Tyler won't let him. 
 Then we have the ex-wife. Of course I didn't want to like the ex... but really she is great. She is in the story some, but I don't feel she dominates from the sidelines. She is caring and determined and the female version of Noah. 
 I simply didn't care if Tyler and his ex got back together or not. I felt that that ship had already sailed. No matter the reasons, which in some I understand why it want down then. In fact, it probably helps that Tyler grew up some and became the man he is today. Stunt man came off as a bit childish in my opinions. Stunt man was had his good moments. I mean he jumps off buildings... that is pretty awesome. I just felt he needed some more confidence within himself before going to seeking Tyler. 
 The epilogue was good. It wasn't great news, but it wasn't the worst news. 
 Well, I will continue the series. I am hoping Noah meets someone as awesome. I just love Noah and his blunt(but caring) personality.  cutting his hair off and talking Dylan into it also. HAHA  His buddies are all moving forward into coupledom and he is the last one standing. Plus, he just deserves happiness too. I think this book is when it really dawned him that being a bachelor and one night stands aren't as fun anymore.""",2014-10-19 20:35:33,"The Boyfriend Mandate (The Boyfriend Chronicles, #2)",romance;fiction,River Jaymes

 Part I 
 connor:  I agree I ship him and rissa so hard haha. I understand rissa though, but the things that she feels for him just makes me think its just all the good parts of over unwinds. In my unsouled review I said that cam was starting to scare me, because he was getting anger from all of the parts.  
 Starkey:  I honestly dont think there is any hope for the storks unless starkey is out. He is just way too crazy and self obsessed to really care about anyone else. I agree with connor 100% when he says the storks arn't helping at all, they are making the AWOLS look scary  
 oh those advertisements are insane, but they totally seem like the ones we see. 
 Printer:  I understand why connor is hesitant to touch the printer because it is the only one there is, and I also understand that he needs to also get moving and try to figure it out. ""we need some stem cells"" ""okay I'll go pick some up at walmart"" looool that was so funny. I missed sonia.  
 Rissa  Rissa gives off a very different ribe than the first book, mostly because she has been through so much. I can't believe how strong she is and that she can still smile and laugh. When she said that there was no destination for the AWOLS it hit me. What are they going to do?  
 Basement:  That kid in the basement I forget his name, like bae or something lol. But he is scaring me. ""he would be a great leader if he would stop being full of himself"" (not an exact quote) but it was funny lol. I feel like he is going to have a big role. He is sticking his nose into their business and I don't think he will stay out of their way much longer.  
 part II 
 gardener :  it's interesting to have a different perspective.  
 Argent: really?! I think because I thought nelson was with him, I read fast and I don't really catch details so I thought nelson was the one who corrected him but it makes sense now.  
 Hayden and Jeevan:  Yeah I really hope they teach this tool a lesson  
 Risa  I keep picturing them at sonia's place looking for them and finding out that there is a basement since it goes to the exact inch.  
 Lev  Idk its a toss up, you dont know if they want to say out of it or if they think they have stayed out too long  
 Cam  yeah idk he still scares me big time. I have never liked him, and I am more afraid of him than anything. Part of me feels bad like its not his fault but then the other part just makes me think I like all the parts and not him. I am happy that he still hates Rebecca though. I can't wait for him to shut her up.  
 Part III 
 Sonia's  every time the group would seperate I would get excited that nelson wouldn't find them and then it was like dangit!  
 Cam:  well that was no surprise. But yet, I didn't expect them to be so ugly looking. Some details were shocking but most were obvious  
 Sonia's  I can't believe she broke it!!!!! I am nervous to see how Connor's parents act. So now that Connor is gone, Nelson won't find him but he will find risa and hope Connor will go after her? That's my guess  
 Part IV 
 Starkey:  that's exactly what I thought!!! But I thought they were against it?! Is the government the clappers??  
 Cam:  he saw Roberta go in there so he wanted to see. I think he wants to not let them happen which would be good, but I think he should like talk to them and use them  
 Sonia:  I love her so much! It still hasn't hit me... She cares about their lives more than her own and I love her  
 Grace:  yeah go grace!  
 Part V 
 Argent:  omg!!!! He is the server!  
 !!!!  I am in utter shock right now. Wtf Connor can't be unwinded!!!  
 Nelson:  When nelson started talking about connors eyes it hit me  
 thoughts:  yeah I can't believe all of this is happening. We just lost two main characters. I am hoping argent stole all of Connor and find someone to rewind him? Plus they said lev was still alive so your dream might still happen. 
 NELSON THO!!!! Yesssss! So happy he got a painful unwind, let's see how you like it buddy!!!  
 End

Her father is in prison, her family gone, and with a secret tragedy that forever changed her, and she is trying to put a life together, to stand on her own. She is a hard worker and willing to do whatever she has to to make it on her own and owe no one. 
 Myles Franco has made a lot of mistakes in his past. He has now sworn off any females and has dedicated himself to his work. It is one thing trying to move on from his past mistakes but the problem is that those closest to him won't let him forget. 
 Brantley meets her new neighbor Myles under less then pleasant circumstances. Neither like each other, she thinks he is an ass and he thinks she is a b**ch. However there is no denying how each thinks the other is very pleasant to look at. Soon their runs in are less then friendly and filled with slamming doors. However, when a storm hits their town they are forced to actually spend some time together. 
 Brantley and Myles can not deny to themselves or each other the attraction they have. The question is can they let down their walls and share the secrets of their past. 
 I went into this one completely blind, no idea what to expect. I loved these characters and their stories. I will worn you this book is full of angst and miscommunication which usually irritates me but I loved everything about this story. I could not put it down.

 4.5 Lovingly kinky stars 
 This is the final installment in Brad and Julia's love story. These will always be two of my favorite characters. I love that Julia is a strong lead that doesn't suffer from the stupid decision that most female leads seam to fall prey to. She is level headed, thinks out her decisions, loves from her heart, and believes in communicating. 
 Yes it is true that there is nothing conventional about Brad but the one thing you can say about him is that he loves with all his heart and he will do whatever to save and be with Julia. What is great about Julia is that she is one that doesn't need to be saved but can save herself. But then she still loves the fact that she knows Brad is her safety and is always there for her. 
 In this book we get to know more about Brad's family (I will just say flat out I do not like his father and so wanted him to get his due) and Julia and Brad continue their loving yet unusual relationship, and for them it just works. I have really enjoyed Brad and Julia's journey together.""",2014-04-04 05:05:12,"End of the Innocence (Innocence, #3)",romance;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Alessandra Torre

 I discovered Fighting Destiny when I saw a few Goodreads friends reading it and thought, what the heck I will give it a try. I was hooked from the very first page and was dying to read the next book in the series. However, I used some self control since I had a ton of books waiting for me on my kindle to read and a bunch of ARC's to finish. However, while planning to leave on a vacation I thought what the heck now is a good time to treat myself and go ahead and read the next book in this series and see what happens to Syn. 
 So not disappointed. It is rare that a second book in a series is as good as the first especially when one has high expectations. This is one of those rare finds. I devoured this book, could not put it down. 
 Let me say I love Syn, she is a kick ass heroine, who is still very loving and very feminine. There is no resisting this woman. Syn has found herself a member of a world she was taught to hate, hunt, and kill. Now she is fighting turning into one of them. However, no matter how much she denies what she is there is not avoiding it. 
 Ryder is the man (Fae) she can't stay away from but she still doesn't fully trust him, yet he is the only one who can help her become who she is meant to be. I really don't want to go too much into the details of this book because it is filled with twists and turns, passion and surprises and I would hate to spoil any of them. 
 I will only say one thing..... YOU MUST READ THIS SERIES!! You will be so glad you did. It has everything, passion (lots and lots) romance, love, action, mystery. The supporting characters are almost as fantastic as the main ones. Trust me when I say you will be so glad you read this book.

240,186074,3,"""I am a myth, a very special kind of myth that creates itself. The best lies about me are the ones I told."" 
 I read this book early last year and forgot to write a review until it was too late, so I took advantage of the long vacation to read it once again--thus, here I am writing this while feelings and emotions are still fresh. 
 It took me ages to finish this book the first time I read it and although I finished it a lot quicker the second time around, it still took me longer than how I usually peruse fantasy novels. The reason for this was the pacing of the frame story. See, Name of the Wind covers two timelines: The present, wherein Kvothe tells of his life story; and the past, the story being told. Truthfully speaking, I found the frame story a bit slow, too slow to my liking, that it took me ages to get past the opening chapters. I remember giving up reading the book multiple times because of it. However, once the real story began, the book became very difficult to put down. 
 ""I would pass over the whole of that evening, in fact. I would spare you the burden of any of it if one piece were not necessary to the story. It is vital. It is the hinge upon which the story pivots like an opening door. In some ways, this is where the story begins."" 
 Name of the Wind's magic was one of the things I loved most about it. Of course, there is ""knowing one's true name""--a concept that has been used in fantasy literature throughout history, but more importantly, I was fascinated by Sympathy. It was interesting how the author used concepts and laws borrowed from real Science and built a magic system around it--it can give you quite a headache too if you tried too hard to understand it. The school setting reminded me of Hogwarts, but not quite. Familiar yet foreign. I get why people see some similarities with Harry Potter but seriously speaking I think that's as far as it goes. Name of the Wind has its distinct charm that cannot be found elsewhere. 
 Overall, I enjoyed this book. The stories within stories were fascinating and absorbing. The world was carefully built, and although it took me awhile to be submerged in it, the dive was worth it. Rothfuss is a great storyteller. He has a way with words--his prose dances and flirts with you like music, and I think this element shines through the brightest whenever Kvothe speaks of Denna. You'll understand what I mean once you've read it.

244,13449677,4,"""This review and more at Sab The Book Eater 
 Ah yes, another one of my most anticipated books. I love being part of the VMafia (represent!) and I simply couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Everything about it intrigued me: how does ""sealing souls"" work? A demon book boyfriend? Female MC's a nerd? Sounds freaking awesome, right? Right. 
 This isn't just one of those books where the guy's impossibly hot and you'll immediately like him just for that. In fact, Dante's a douche - from start to finish. The only difference is he gradually focused his douchebaggery elsewhere as the story moved forward so he actually becomes less of a douche. But what's so likable about him if he's such a bad guy? His sense of humor. 
 I've never been average. I look like a movie star and move like an athlete. That didn't change when I kicked the bucket. It's okay to be jealous, to covet me. It's a delicious sin - tastes like chicken. 
 When I read that line it took me a while to get over it. Heck I'm still not over it. Dante was so funny that all the mean things he said didn't sound that mean. But he was still mean, let's not forget. Him being a demon and all. 
 I never got bored with the story because of Dante's narration that was both entertaining and witty. I also liked his whole transformation. Dante remained his funny self when he decided to go against the grain so I didn't feel like anything was rushed or unreasonable or overly dramatic. It was inevitable but it didn't appear all too dramatic (I thought it would). It was just right. 
 Then we have Charlie. I honestly didn't expect Charlie to be... well, an ugly nerd. I thought she'd at least be passable-but-quirky-cute and Dante would just fall head over heels for her. But he didn't... at least not right away. It took a long while. A makeover became all too inevitable once Dante kept commenting on everything he finds physically unattractive about Charlie. Just to give you just how unattractive Charlie is, here's how Dante described her: 
 This is the girl Boss Man is after? She looks like a porcelain doll... beat three times with an ugly stick. 
 Douchebag, right? But Charlie still saw through all that and he liked him for him. That's the most attractive thing about Charlie - her heart (cue ""awwww""). Oh man that's cheesy! I'm serious though. She's so sweet and forgiving despite going through a lot of crap. I liked how quirky she was and how simple it was to like her. 
 Insta love. Here's what I liked about the love story: Dante didn't fall in love instantly. I often characterize insta love by the span of time the leads spend together that I forget to consider how or why their feelings developed. It was clear that Dante saw the good in Charlie and she affected him greatly. He's a demon after all. It's like he got an intervention when he started spending time with Charlie. So I get that he fell madly in love with her. What I didn't get though was how Charlie was able to reciprocate the feelings. I know she's got a really good heart and she saw through Dante's mask from day one (day one!) but I didn't understand how she could return the same kind of love Dante felt. I just didn't. In fact, when Charlie started ignoring Dante and was being overly dramatic, I got super annoyed. It was just so confusing! She obviously has feelings for him but she's acting all weird. It was so not her. *rolls eyes* I'm just glad the book's written in Dante's POV. The love story made sense from his side. Charlie's? Not so much. I'm hoping for more insight from Charlie in the next book though. 
 Now the thing I wasn't so hot about was the big twist in the story that turned everything upside down. The story just blew up into a bigger thing that I don't think really fits well with how the story was going through the first half. Everything was all light in the beginning but when the conflict came it sort of gave the book a different feel. Plus, it was weird. Charlie becoming the light of the world who's going to bring peace for hundreds (I think) of years? A bit far-fetched if you ask me.  
 Anyhoo. I'm eager to see how the next book will turn out. There were so many things left hanging and we need lots of explanations! And Dante! Lots of Dante. ;) ---the creepy winky face. 
 I really liked it as a whole because there was never a dull moment for me. Even though I didn't quite like a few things here and there, what matters is The Collector kept me entertained. 4 stars for Dante and the awesome Victoria Scott!

246,19057,4,"""This is the kind of book that will buoy you up and make you happy. It's a fast read and sweeps you through the lives of 13 people that will touch you. However, you can't analyze it too closely because the cracks begin to show. 
 Ed Kennedy is an extraordinarily ordinary human being. Or so he thinks. He dreams of being something more, and fulfilling his own expectations of himself. He's lazy but unsatisfied. Until he stops a bank robbery and sets off a chain of events beyond his control. Now, is his chance to change the lives of people who desperately need it. 
 And it is a wonderful story of change and reaching your potential. Of making sacrifices to climb higher and of friendship and second chances. It's a whole package of goodness. But it also has a portion of ""mystery,"" and it doesn't really hold up to expectation. As Ed receives his instructions, he wonder who is directing him. Why? How? It's a pretty weird set of circumstances. But honestly, the curiosity never really hit me or made me frustrated. It was just a puzzle piece that didn't really fit. And it wasn't resolved clearly. 
 The confusion of the ""mystery"" was still the only problem I really found with this book. Otherwise, the characters leapt off the pages and the problems they all faced were palpable. Even the religious ideas in the book were inspiring and universal, not all-consuming or aggravating. It was very nicely written and the change in Ed was a gradual flow through the book. 
 I still have no idea how or why what happened came to pass. Maybe I need to give it another read, but the resolution was bland. The reasoning behind Ed's mission was almost meaningless; it added no real purpose to the story. The highlight was the individuals themselves and how Ed managed to help them. Ed Kennedy is a wonderful storyteller and a very real human being. He is kind but flawed and his attempt to do something for his community is something I enjoyed immensely.""",2013-06-18 22:41:57,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak

 I liked some of it and some of it I did not. 
 Jenna comes into the book as a scared, beaten and brutally raped 16 year old. The book revolves around her and Kidd, a member of the MC and younger brother to Chipper who finds Jenna when he goes to the Metland club. To make things even more icky, Jenna was given, given to this scum who beat on her and raped her when she was 16 by her father. So when Chipper saves her for a while she is afraid she'd be sent back so she doesn't completely reveal who her father is, Brew who is the VP of the Metland club..yea. So Kidd has a thing for Jenna, but knows he won't act upon it until she is 18, but after her encounter with him on her birthday things change and Jenna has to make a decision, become an old lady or become a club whore. She chooses to become a club whore because she sees what happens behind old lady's backs and she doesn't want that. She has a place at the club and runs things herself etc. Kidd really screwed up with her because of the things he said to her on her 18th birthday ultimately brought her to her decision and also turned her to Ice. She won't talk to him or let him apologize for his major screw up. And what a screw up it is. So 6 years later after an incident rocks Jenna's world, Chipper asks Kidd to step in. So he does, because Kidd is now the Pres of the MC of all the affiliates as well. He decides to forcefully claim Jenna as his own and from there the story takes off. 
 For the most part it's interesting, I completely get why Jenna thinks the way she does especially with the way she was treated and had to live at a very young age. Kidd threw that to her because he was so pissed off at himself he threw her away.

254,19398490,3,"""Literary Fiction is difficult to pull off. It easily comes off as pretentious or superficial and, unfortunately, that is very true of All the Light We Cannot See. 
 Almost every chapter (of which there are over 100) ends with a whispering bit of prose that is clearly meant to make readers stop and underline and circle passages and draw hearts or exclamation points in the margins. Perhaps if chapters were not so short (which I actually really loved), or if Doerr chose to end some chapters with cliff-hangers, some with finality, some with those ethereal bits of prose that he loves so much, it would not have impeded his story as much as it did. Instead, those moments of prose become tedious instead of incidental and the more frequently they appear, the more obvious it becomes that each is a painstakingly created image. That ruins their grace. 
 It's hard to do well and there is something ineffable about the work that goes behind creating the kind of image that takes your breath away without make you roll your eyes. I did a lot of rolling my eyes while I read this book. 
 That said, the book is still beautiful. The story, a wandering examination of several lives impacted by WWII with a precious stone at its center, is compelling. Each character is flawed and strong and relatable. The undertones of the supernatural in the midst of what is otherwise historical fiction offer a really wonderful weighty levity (I mean, how else do you describe the supernatural darkness that drives the characters' paranoia about the curse of the diamond and its impact on world history and the characters personal lives?!  to the story. 
 Really, my only criticism is that this book would be better if it didn't take itself so seriously. That can be said for lots of things, so it's not a crippling criticism, but it did decrease my enjoyment of the book.""",2015-02-17 13:15:57,All the Light We Cannot See,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;young-adult,Anthony Doerr

 This one was a little of both. The first half of it was interesting, but mainly because the premise was so good. An invisible dome that suddenly and inexplicably cuts off a small Maine town from the rest of the world? How intriguing is that? However, I didn't connect with any of the characters, and the Big Bad Guy was more annoying than frightening. I was totally sucked into the story for the second half, because good golly molly, can Stephen King write suspense! Things start happening fast, and I couldn't read fast enough to keep up. As I feared from the beginning though, even King couldn't come up with a reason for the Dome's existence that was as cool as it was.

 Sharon Ashwood gives good haunted house in her paranormal romance, Ravenous. 
 Ghost-busting grab student Holly Carver is a witch out to make tuition money, but the Flanders House is no easy job. Six people have entered the building, but none have emerged yet. So in goes Holly and her vampire partner Alessandro Caravelli to investigate. Work of demons is definitely afoot, but that takes some kind of sorcery, so who's the mastermind? 
 The author's website proclaims this as ""urban fantasy romance"". Ah...no. I much agree with the publisher's label of ""paranormal romance"". The first three chapters are intriguing, and Flanders House makes for one hell of an interesting read. But the rest of the novel doesn't live up to it, though there are worthy scenes here and there. 
 The problem lies mainly with the characters. Long-haired, leather-clad vampire Alessandro has superficial qualities (if you go for that unoriginal type), but otherwise I can't really describe his character. He doesn't come alive. Same with Holly, bordering on being a Mary Sue - three guys fancy her (including her 1 tru wuv, so the others have to be evil, right?) for no particular reason I can see other than she's there. And Holly has a lot of powerful magic, only it's crippled in the beginning. But of course it's conveniently restored for her to defeat the baddies, but I would've respected her more if her powers had remained handicapped. 
 A childhood accident led to Holly's magic being crippled, but for me her sister Ashe Carver deserves her own novel. She has the more interesting story: Ashe had magic, and then she lost it for good. So how is she dealing with paranormal problems when she no longer has her powers? 
 The author has the potential to write some really interesting stuff. But for now her characters need to step out from their prescribed cardboard cut-outs and become more like real people.

 I enjoyed this book. It was an easy, laid-back read that kept me entertained with its sweet story line. 
 Right from the start this book has my attention. Cameron is looking to let go for one night and it leads her to Aidan. Things then get interesting when she finds out he's her boss at her new job. I enjoy forbidden romances, I like the secrecy and danger element of being discovered and I think that side of things was created well in No Kissing Allowed. 
 As well as that, Aidan's commitment issues added another dimension they had to overcome. I felt for him and his views of himself, but I thought his growth was believable and steady. I grew to like him more and more as the story developed and by the end I didn't want to stop reading. 
 Which leads me to the only issue I have--and it's not really an issue, just a wish. I really wanted this book to be longer. It was a short read but I loved the author's style and it was so easy to get lost in. I wanted more from the characters who could make me smile and I didn't want it to end.

 This is one of those books that has been on my to-buy list forever. I finally got round to purchasing it last November and finally started and finished reading it a few days ago. It has split my opinion and I'm not sure I'm going to explain why as my head is a rambling mess, but I'll give it a go. 
 Overall, I liked Legend. It had a kick-ass female lead, a criminal bad-boy and lots of destruction in the dystopian genre. It started off well and the alternating points of view worked in this book, giving a good over view when the characters were apart. It also moved at a quick pace, with short chapters. I was actually surprised at its length when it came in the post as I thought it would be at least 100 pages more--don't know why I assumed it. 
 However, I think my main issue with Legend was that it was predictable. It would have probably been better if I'd read it when it first came out as I wouldn't have been so used to the genre but reading it now, it just read like every other dystopian book. It also didn't hold or conceal its secrets very well. I had guessed the ending at the twist way before it was revealed so I did find it lacking in that sense because I was right on every assumption. 
 Saying that, I probably will by the second book though as it finishes on an annoying cliff hanger that only sums up part of the book and I'm intrigued to see where it goes next.""",2013-07-21 03:21:45,"Legend (Legend, #1)",romance;fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime,Marie Lu

 I really enjoyed this book when I read it, I was 13. However now if I read it I'm not sure if I would enjoy it as much. It is an interesting concept and things start revealing themselves that are quite important to the plot. 
 The more traditional approach to a vampire is brought in to this book which adds more action and gore. This book has a lot more bloody scenes from what I can remember and is a lot more. 
 Both the characters Neferet and Aphrodite are revealed further and expanded beyond the mentor and the bully. Also more magical abilities come foreword. Stevie Rae's character is also developed. 
 I find the character Loren Blake extremely annoying, I don't like zoey around him and find him false. 
 Although better than the first I still feel this book is a little dull, however the story does pick up after this book. Quite slow paced at times.""",2014-05-09 15:51:55,"Betrayed (House of Night, #2)",romance;fiction;young-adult;fantasy;paranormal,P.C. Cast;Kristin Cast
280,186074,4,"""Oh, epic fantasy, how I do love you. There's just something exciting about experiencing an entirely world with its own magic system, fascinating characters and history, and of course, epic conflicts. 
 What I liked about this book is that it does the frame story well. We get a glimpse of the main character, Kvothe, and hints of what he can do and what he has done. This then gives credibility to the fantastic details of the first person narrative, which otherwise would feel like just another tale. I like how the telling of the story impacts the present, and I hope that in the second and third books because he has told his story, our main character is empowered to move forward and do greater things. Because of the frame story, there's a hint of mystery throughout as we try to unravel the main character. 
 This book has a fun mix-up of classic tropes. The life of the bard, the life of the inner-city impoverished orphan, the life of the student at a school (university) for learning magic, and the life of a young adventurer. Because of the frame story, we know the main character is going to become a warrior, but it doesn't happen in this book.

281,25854070,5,"""Warning: this novella kept me up late and made me cry and I want to hug it and squeeze it and love it. It's also got that ""trapped in a blizzard with only one hotel room"" trope that works for so many people, including me. 
 Trevor is a successful artist, living in a small Colorado mountain town. He's also dying. He's been on dialysis for years, and the story opens with his doctor informing him that it won't help much longer. Trevor has a rare blood type and no kidney donor. He's preparing to fly home for Christmas to tell his wonderful family that he might not be around for the next one. 
 Marc is a workaholic attorney. When his brother outed him in his teens, his mother basically cut off her affection. She waited until he was eighteen to kick him out. Since then, he's constantly chased the next level of success, subconsciously trying to earn back his mother's love, even though he hasn't spoken to her in over ten years. He's driving home from the office when the freeway gets shut down due to a blizzard. He treks to a nearby hotel and gets one of the last rooms. 
 Trevor and Marc meet in the hotel lounge, and Trevor doesn't have a room. They chat for hours and eventually Marc invites Trevor to spend the night. Trevor seizes what he feels is his last opportunity to be desired, to feel alive and unburdened. Marc just falls for Trevor after one powerful kiss, and has ""an oddly strong desire to give this man everything he had, to make this the best, most memorable experience of Trevor's life."" 
 They have great sex, and they snuggle and talk and bond. Marc realizes how lonely he is, while Trevor sees it as a nice farewell to life. Trevor doesn't tell Marc that he's dying, you see. When Marc suggests that they spend a few more days together, Trevor agrees only after saying that it's temporary and can't mean anything. 
 I loved the gentle emotion in this book. Each man wants to give everything to the other in the short time that they have. Trevor especially wants to give Marc a happy Christmas memory, and to give him something to care about when he's gone. Marc, not understanding the true time limit, just wants to convince Trevor to give him a longer chance. 
 Even though their time together was short, I fully believed the affection they had for each other. The story doesn't end there. This is a romance and it does have a happy ending, but I won't spoil it. This was just a sweet (and sexy) emotional story, really done well. I loved it.

 This is my first book about a motorcycle club and Oh My! It definitely set the bar high for the next books I plan on reading. 
 It was an emotion filled roller coaster, fast paced exciting story! It took turns I didn't see coming and kept me on edge. I'm so glad I picked this up. I would definitely recommend it in a heartbeat! 
 Overall the plot was great and the characters were so pleasantly developed. I will say, Helen is one the most likable heroines I've stumble upon. She was strong willed and made the most out of the situation she was in. Plus, she's a badass with full sleeves tattoos. 
 Holder: 
 My heart went to Holder, he had me from the beginning. I felt like his heart was at the right place but the circumstances he was in didn't allow him to do more. Even though, he did go out of his way to do the right thing and that I appreciated. He was born into this MC lifestyle and I was able to understand why he made some decisions. I was kind of rooting for him throughout the story. 
 ""It's like I've spent my life waitin' for you: waitin' for you to grow up, waitin' for you to feel the same, and goddamn it, but I hate waitin'."" He gives a bitter laugh. ""You stole my entire world and I'm not sure how to live in it anymore.""

 Well, this book causes that effect. 
 Rothfuss writes poetic prose, you feel the rhythm of the words as they match with each other, paragraphs go smooth as you read, the word choice, the sentence patterns, the imagery and metaphors used: Nothing seems forced, it flows, naturally, it develops on your head as you read it and shows you everything the author wants you to see. 
 Characters are great, Kvothe is charming enough to feel his distress on his times of need, his joy and his desperation for acceptance of an ""impossible love"", his friendship and camaraderie.

286,186074,5,"""5 stars. This stands as one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. Review to come as soon as I can organize my thoughts. 
 Before I try to organize my feelings into a concise review, I first must thank Patrick Rothfuss for writing such a complex, vivid world with imperfect, relatable characters and imaginative magic. This was a treat to read. At first, I tried to force myself into reading this a small chunk at a time, but once I hit the 200 page mark, I was completely immersed in the story and lacked the self-restraint to continue taking it slow. 
 Rothfuss' writing style is something that I don't run across very often. Without being too descriptive, I saw the world as Rothfuss saw it. I saw every unwritten detail about the towns, the countryside, the sky. There was enough detail to create a world where I was able to fit seamlessly into it and fill in the gaps without being told what to see. For me, this is what make The Name of the Wind so compelling. 
 In terms of characters, I loved the realistic portrayal of love. Typically it doesn't happen overnight, and sometimes it ends in heartbreak. I was so relived that there wasn't any superficial ""instalove,"" which seems to be the new favorite trope of YA fantasy. Instead, Rothfuss added emotion to his portrayal of love, which by definition makes any relationship imperfect. 
 I could go on and on about how much I liked this book. However, I have a dilemma. Should I rush into the second book knowing that the third book isn't coming anytime soon, or do I deprive myself of the second book until there is a release date of the third book? Either way, I will immediately be re-reading The Name of the Wind.""",2015-11-23 07:10:27,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

288,16076395,5,"""The author was kind enough to give me a copy of her book in exchange for an honest review. 
 Once Upon a Road Trip is based on a true story of the author's 2 month long road trip. It's a trip that a lot of people think of having, but never end up doing. She stays with people she met off the internet. But not to worry, she had defense training, mace, and a knife, so she was fully prepared for anything that might come her way. But then there was Canada...oh Canada. She could've gone to jail for carrying mace but holding a knife is perfectly fine. Craziness. 
 Faith, hope and love are common themes in Angela Blount's debut novel, Once Upon a Road Trip. While faith may be a turn-off for some readers, it's refreshing for those that have faith in their lives, such as myself. Reading it, I felt myself wish that I was as strong of a person as Angie is. She has her boundaries and convictions that she does well in keeping throughout the novel. She incorporated Christ in her life by always asking for guidance and showing love to those around her, and she grew throughout the novel. 
 I loved the story and while it may have taken a little bit of time to really get into it, I found myself hooked. I absolutely loved the love story! Especially since it is a true happy ending. It's the story of true love and how she met her children's father. I also loved how clean it was! So many young adult stories have sex involved, and it's refreshing to see a character that wants to wait until marriage. 
 I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read an inspirational read about a girl with faith that takes the trip of a lifetime. I look forward to reading more books from her.""",2013-10-12 09:38:49,"Once Upon a Road Trip (Once Upon a Road Trip, #1)",young-adult;romance;non-fiction;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography,Angela N.

289,17730406,4,"""We were introduced to Ghost and Natalie in Friend-Zoned. I was beyond excited reading Friend-Zoned because I feel love with every single character! 
 But Ghost? 
 See I just knew his story would be a good one and I was really hoping we would get his next! And what a story it was. 
 Belle Aurora wrote Love Thy Neighbour in the same way she wrote Friend-Zoned and I loved every single word of it. She's got a great writing voice and her characters feel like they can just walk off the page and into your life seamlessly. In Friend-Zoned we were introduced to this group of men and women who come together by chance because of the budding relationship between Nik and Tina. I really loved those two and I was so happy to see more of them in Love Thy Neighbour. I didn't really have someone in mind when I thought of Tina however, I always picture Maksim Chmerkovskiy as Nik. 
 But I digress...this is about Ghost and Natalie! 
 ""This girl. She's my girl. She's not perfect. Neither am I. But she's perfect for me, and I'll do anything I can to keep her."" 
 Ghost is one of those guys with impenetrable armor. He has a past that no one should ever have and those demons keep him locked up like Ft. Knox. In comes Natalie and she's a force to be reckoned with. She's beautiful, funny, and very strong willed. 
 Together they are perfect. 
 As it is in life, nothing is ever easy. There are several obstacles these two must over come. With every situation you'll find yourself smiling. You'll even laugh out loud a few times. And the sex....holy cow is this book hot!!! My Kindle screen steamed up several times! 
 Ghost aka Asher is still probably my favorite of all the characters. There's just something about him that makes you want to love him. 
 The story could have been much deeper with lots more angst but that would have taken the light, fun tone of Belle Aurora's books. In my opinion these are stories to be enjoyed and not necessarily critiqued at every turn. They are serious but fun. 
 ""Tina leans forward and asks quietly, 'Do you? You know? Love her?' 
 Squeezing Nat's knee again, I reply, 'She's teachin' me how.""

290,17325147,5,"""This book took me by surprise. At first I thought it was going to be good. I knew it would probably be sad. I guessed I would probably cry. What I didn't count on was my emotional attachment to every character. I didn't know that I would become so invested in this story that I would have to walk away from it to collect myself. I didn't realize how close to home certain aspects of this book would hit. I also didn't count on loving it so much. There were times when I couldn't breathe. I literally sat there holding my breath. It was that overwhelming. That haunting. That beautiful. This is a story about healing, forgiveness, love, and for pushing yourself towards LIFE every single day. 
 ""This book is for everyone who has survived. You are not broken. You can love and be loved, despite what may feel like the eternally brutal nature of the world. Even when you're drowning and so far under, there is always time to reach for someone who will teach you how to breathe again."" 
 Blythe is struggling to survive. Her parents are gone. Her brother in another state. It's her last year at college and she's just barely making it through her last year of college. Then Sabin barrels into her life. This chance encounter throws her off course and she makes a decision right then and there. 
 ""Today I will be able to say that I did something unexpected."" 
 This is how she ends up meeting Chris. What a beautiful soul this man has. He's been through something that no one should ever have to endure and yet he's surprising well adjusted. However, the pain felt by both Blythe and Chris is palpable. Together they know they make sense and apart they are broken. They can heal each other...maybe... 
 ""At least one thing is certain: Chris and I are inextricably connected. Do I have factual reasons to know this? Proof? Assurances? No None. 
 Some people believe in God; I believe in Chris."" 
 What I really loved about this book was the slow build. Yes there was an instant connection between the two but no they didn't just fall instantly in love or in bed. The relationship took time to build. It felt real to me. If you come from a past that involves any sort of loss/dysfunction/abuse whatever, then you know that relationships are not easy. Sometimes they don't happen at all. Breaking down those walls and working through your demons is not an easy thing. Letting someone love you when you don't love yourself is even harder. 
 ""I thought he was just like me."" 
 ""I thought we would find our way into a love with no return."" 
 ""I thought we were an absolute."" 
 Chris helps Blythe to breathe again. He shows her how to live through the pain, to accept it, to own it, but to not let it consume you. But for Chris it's not that easy. His pain is much different. He's just not ready to move on. 
 ""You are the great love of my life that I'm never going to have."" 
 I haven't even begun to talk about the other characters. Normally, I might mention one or two because they're funny or add something great to a book. This is by far the first book I've ever read where I loved every single side character. I hate to even call them side characters. I know Blythe and Chris are considered the main but this group boy they are so integral to the story. I know this book wouldn't have been the same without each and every one of them. 
 Chris's siblings are Sabin, Estelle, and Eric. Sabin might just be my favorite of the bunch. He's charismatic and boisterous and funny. He's also battling his own demons. He's there for Blythe in a way that no one else is. She depends on him and he her. They anchor each other. Then you have Estelle who is strong and fiercely independent. She's beautiful and she's also the only who believes in God. Her faith is what helps her to cope yet she too is broken. Eric is Estelle's twin brother. He's shy, sweet, and quiet yet also strong. Zach is Eric's boyfriend and you know they are good for each other but Eric too is broken. James is Blythe's younger brother. He goes to another school and their relationship is complicated. There is a lot of blame and guilt plaguing them because of the circumstances surrounding their parent's death. Seeing what happens between the two was very special for me. 
 Each of these characters have a profound affect on this story. You may only find one that touches you, maybe all of them will, but I know you will connect to one of them. 
 ""You said something last night that was completely wrong. I could never touch anyone the way that I touch you. And I will never forget falling in love with you. Don't forget that."" 
 ""And this is how we say good-bye."" 
 The story will grab your heart and squeeze and squeeze until you think you can't take anymore. It's like this until the very last sentence. You will fall in love. You will want a happy ending for all of them. 
 Left Drowning has everything you could ever want in a book. It's one of the best books I've read this year. Definitely in my top 10 from the last 2 years.

294,16076395,2,"""I received a copy of this from the author in exchange for an honest review. (And I apologize for the lateness--no excuses at all, 100% my fault.) 
 A memoir is a bit different than the usual novel because by insulting the characters, you are indirectly insulting actually people. Strange events can't be deemed as unrealistic because they actually happened, and thoughts that characters have can't be said to be too erratic or contrasting because they were the person's real thoughts. If I insult any of the people who were included and renamed in this story, I apologize. 
 To make it simple, the lasting impression I got from the story was that it made me very angry. The main character, Angeli, was almost raped in this book. I know this book was most likely based on true events the author experienced, so by insulting this I might be insulting the author herself. I'm sorry, that is not my intention. I'm angry because after this event occurred, Angeli did nothing. She knew the possibilities, including that her attacker might even do it to someone else one day, yet did nothing. Being raped, or almost being raped, is never the victim's fault. I'm so sorry that this happened, and I understand how frightening it must have been, but the victim should never be blamed, no matter if s/he is passed out drunk, naked, or in a room with some potential predator. Never. I understand this is most likely what the author did in the actual situation, so she can't change the events, but either way it really infuriates me.  
 To be honest, I feel like the biggest reason I gave this two stars was the ending. The events after this really didn't seem to resolve anything, nor did Angeli receive any worthy consolation, in my opinion. After such a traumatic incident (explained in spoiler), the ending seemed very quick and rushed. 
 I mostly enjoyed the author's style of writing. By switching from third person to short excerpts from the diary Angeli kept throughout her trip, I was able to somewhat understand Angeli's thoughts. Though inconsistent and crazy, they represented that real people have complex minds, not simple 2D ideas that can be tweaked for novel purposes. 
 The characters were also depicted pretty well. I feel like I reacted to every character the way that I should have. The character Scott was a roller coaster of emotions for me, because though I never liked him to begin with, I did start to warm up to him until he proved himself to be a complete and utter fuckface. Three of my favorites included Zak, the boy Angeli stayed with in Canada, and Grady and Vincent, two guys from the south, one of them that eventually became Angeli's love interest. The only character I really had problems with (that I shouldn't have had any with) was Angeli. In the beginning she seemed to regard people in an almost arrogant way, and talked a lot about her ""inner feminine side being repressed"" as well as not wanting to be a stereotype, which apparently is something she cared a lot about throughout the whole book (after her traumatic incident, the fact that she had become a stereotype was one of the first thoughts that sprang to mind.) 
 I normally don't like it when authors include too much religion in a book, so I didn't really appreciate Angeli's thoughts on God. I don't mind if people are religious, but Angeli voiced her thoughts so freely it seemed like disagreeing couldn't be an option unless you were a horrible person, as the only people who doubted God were the fuckhead character i mentioned above, a depressed character who seemed to have no faith in anything (though I did like Kalvin), and a cheating ex-gf. I enjoyed the religious questioning between Vincent and Angeli because Angeli explained why she believed in what she did, showing she was not blindly accepting a faith but believing it because she truly believed she had a relationship with her God. 
 I liked that this was a memoir. It struck me as odd that all of these events actually occurred, but kept the novel refreshing and free of doubt for any one part. Though I wasn't too keen on everyone falling in love with Angeli and telling her they loved her after about two days, I had to remind myself these were actual events and not some sappy hogwash a writer wanted to write. Angeli and Vincent's romance was far from perfect, but I liked Vincent and if he and Angeli are a couple in a real life, then congratulations to both of you.""",2013-12-10 09:00:27,"Once Upon a Road Trip (Once Upon a Road Trip, #1)",young-adult;romance;non-fiction;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography,Angela N.

 It was a very well written book, with a decently different premise and some interesting questions. It flagged a little with the bigger world view, though. Why are werewolves in camps? Only a very small percentage of werewolves are dangerous, so why lock them all up? A lot of YA fantasy right now seems to take the stance that humans are a vicious, terrified species that would automatically turn against ""the other"", and I like to hope, or believe, that we've come farther than that.

 But for those who are perhaps more interested in the premise behind the book, I'm not sure that this book is the best way to find answers or explanations. Just like in real life, sometimes people don't have kids because they are selfish bitches (me) and sometimes they don't have kids because the timing and relationship was never right and sometimes they don't have kids for a thousand other reasons. However, these essays all just seemed to be variations on what privilege (education, class, money, time...) allows you to make choices about. 
 But ya know, I only read the first couple of essays. Maybe life-changing things happened after I gave up. 
 ETA: I thought more about this and I remembered the exact point at which I stopped reading. Lionel Shriver's essay; it was horrifyingly racist in that she laments that her choice not to have kids means she won't be passing along her intelligent and literary European genes. If I feel, oh, a little wistful about the fact that the country of my birth, the United States, will probably within my lifetime no longer be peopled in majority by those of European extraction like me, that passing dismay has never been considerable enough for me to inconvenience myself by giving lifts to football practice. Her whole essay was about how it was so sad that her white and educated friends weren't having babies but that developing countries and immigrants were.

 When the hero can do anything after ten minutes' study, and can always get out of trouble even without the ten minutes, where's the suspense? Kvothe is a Mary Sue, and this is pulp fiction from the ""mighty thews"" era.

301,32620360,4,"""Wish You Were Here is the first contemporary novel of Renee Carlino's that I have read. I previously read her paranormal romance, Lucian Divine, which I did enjoy, but I have never read any of her strictly contemporary novels. I knew nothing about Wish You Were Here before I started reading it and I am glad I did not. Wish You Were Here was a quick, engaging, and emotional read that I enjoyed. I would recommend reading Wish You Were Here if you are interested in reading a quick New Adult contemporary novel that has the potential to make you cry. 
 My favorite part of Wish You Were Here was the fact that part of the story was based in San Diego, California. I fell in love with San Diego the first time I visited the city for San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) in 2014 and I loved being there in the story. I especially loved that the convention center, where SDCC is annually held, was briefly mentioned. I was unable to attend SDCC this year or visit San Diego, but I am glad that I was able to journey there in Wish You Were Here. I wish I was there in San Diego. 
 Although the ability to predict the storyline of Wish You Were Here was rather easy, I appreciated the path the story took. Wish You Were Here is essentially a book about life. While it also features love, loss, moving-on, and recovery, the true purpose is to celebrate life. Not many books I have read feature the theme of life when under these particular circumstances. 
 The characters of Wish You Were Here were, by no means my favorite characters of all-time, but I fell in love with them and their story. While I do not agree with all the main character's choices and I do condemn some of them, it was interesting to follow her on this journey. Laura's Mvula's Show Me Love is a great anthem for her journey and story arc. The romance in Wish You Were Here was nice, but it was cheesy, at times. 
 Wish You Were Here was an enjoyable read and I am interested to read Renee Carlino's other contemporary books, I currently own Sweet Thing and After the Rain.

308,19057,4,"""I was inspired by the main character Ed's very normal life. Maybe normal is too nice a word. His life is more mediocre. He doesn't have any ambitions or achievements or direction really. The story is about him receiving anonymous cards in the mail that challenge him to help people. He changes their lives in small and big ways just by being observant. It made me want to observe and serve others more. If an ordinary guy can help in small ways, then so can I. 
 After reading I Am The Messenger, I got that chance. 
 I saw a guy shopping for baby formula at the grocery store. He would look at a can of baby formula for a minute and put it back. Then he'd look at another can. Then he'd put it back. I found this strange and fascinating. Most people quickly dump 8 cans of the exact same formula in their shopping cart and hurry off. I have never seen someone compare types of baby formula so carefully. 
 This guy was taking his time for some reason. I continued to watch him (he didn't notice because he was now scrutinizing a fifth can of formula) and tried to figure out what situtation would make someone shop for formula like that. He must never have bought it before. Maybe he has a wife at home with a screaming newborn baby and was instructed to ""get formula"" only to find the grocery store has 473829 kinds. And now he doesn't know what kind to get. So I went up to him and helped explain the difference between the 439280 kinds of formula and gave him a coupon. He seemed grateful. I imagined him going home to his wife victorious because he'd gotten the right formula AND used a coupon. 
 It's not life changing or anything. That being said, Ed didn't feel like he was doing anything life changing either. 
 It's not a big thing, but I guess it's true-- big things are often just small things that are noticed. 
 -Markus Zusak, I Am the Messenger (p. 221). 
 But it reminded me that kindness, true kindness, comes from listening and observing others to see what they really need. Small acts of kindness are big in their own way. 
 The reason this story works is because it's crude, crass, biting, sarcastic, and full of swearing. Let me explain. The writing hides the preachiness of the story so well that I really enjoyed reading it and it wasn't until the end that I realized I learned something. I'm not saying something has to be crude for you to learn something. But hiding a story about serving others in a crude story might accidentally teach someone something when all they had really intended was to pick up an entertaining book. Making it a little crude can also make the story relatable so you close the book feeling like the character did things that you are more than capable of doing, too. 
 There were some parts of the writing that I found so beautiful. Here's one of my favorite quotes. I just love how Markus Zusak takes a cliche saying and switches the words around to paint a lovely picture: 
 Quietly, Marv cries. 
 His hands appear to be dripping on the wheel. The tears grip his face. They hold on and slide reluctantly for his throat. 
 -Markus Zusak, I Am the Messenger (p. 316). 
 I like that the tears grip his face instead of his hands gripping the wheel. But I can still imagine the image of tears gripping his face like he's trying so hard not to cry but he can't help it. I find it so beautiful for some reason. 
 The twist at the end did confuse me. [spoiler]Who is the messenger? My book club helped me figure it out. The character is the message about serving others and the author is the messenger because he made up the story. Right??[/spoiler] 
 Ed's friend has a crappy car and he keeps calling it a Falcon. I've never heard of that kind of car so I couldn't get this image out of my head:

 Oh noes. My experience with Anna was mucho baddo : ( 
 There's Someone Inside Your House is Exhibit A of why you shouldn't just throw the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to giving an author a second chance. This was everything I wanted it to be. Much like with One Of Us Is Lying earlier this year, the comparison to its ""inspired by"" or counterpart or whatever you want to call it was spot on. The only difference??? 
 They say there are no more original ideas. And maybe that's true. (Except what Shelby just read about eating baby teeth - that seems pretty friggin' original.) There's Someone Inside Your House proves that an idea doesn't have to be original for it to be a crapload of fun. This one follows the slasher formula pretty well. There's a super baddy who just wants to . . . . 
 Well, maybe he wants to stab the shit out of you and mash your brains, but you get the idea.

 ""I thought at least you could give me this, you could at least do that, but the truth is that you give me nothing."" 
 Welcome to my favorite week of the year! Unfortunately, real life kind of got in the way and I failed to realize Banned Book Week was quickly approaching until I received the pop-up reminder on my calendar this morning. It just so happens that by some strange coincidence I had finished My Absolute Darling last week and (of course) had not yet written anything down. While not yet a ""banned"" or ""challenged"" book, I figure it will only be a matter of time before this selection becomes one due to its disturbing subject matter and the fact that since it is about a 14 year old girl, there's a good chance young people will want to read it. 
 What you have here is a coming of age story about a girl who named Turtle (actual name Julia). Turtle is a girl who lives up to her moniker - attempting at all costs to stay inside the safety of her own shell to protect her family secret from getting out. And I'm going to go ahead and spoil this because readers really need to know what they're getting into here before they decide to add this to their TBR: Turtle's father is not only emotionally and physically abusive throughout the story, but their relationship is also incestous. 
 I picked this up because of my friend Jennifer's glowing review. Sadly, I didn't have a 5 Star reading experience like she did. I appreciate what the author tried to do, but there were some things that pulled me out of the story - and when you're reading something that should feel like getting hit in the face with a frying pan for the duration, being pulled away leaves you with a feeling almost like vertigo (which may be beneficial to many readers *shrug*). 
 So what went wrong for me? Well, to begin with, this needed a heavier-handed editor. As I said before, it didn't always flow for me. My initial thought was it must have been translated to English due to the excessive use of adjectives and detailed descriptions of the local flora and fauna (and at times, Turtle's ""engorged"" bits *eww and also not really an accurate descriptor*), while the actual story itself (which should have been graphically brutal if it followed the author's pattern of writing) was lacking. Not to mention all the G.D. gun talk. If someone needs to be punched in the face like this one did with the foreshadowing, then they probably should stick to easy-readers. The choice of third person narration with everything being only from Turtle's perspective was off-putting as well. I think this would have been much more powerful if written in first person. The way it was I had tons of questions I wanted answers to that could have been provided (and I'm usually one who is okay with not knowing every detail). But I wanted to know more about what made Martin a monster. Was his upbringing truly terrible? Did he repeat the sins of his father? Was he simply a bullshit artist? I wanted to be in his brain. First person would have made that impossible and I wouldn't be griping about it. I also assume Martin murdered Turtle's mother, but that was an open-ended matter as well. I'll leave it that I'm dubious she died while ""abalone diving."" While I do love the ""John Green"" type of teenager, Jacob and Brett were just a little too cool for school in my opinion. And then there was the little something extra (no spoilsies). This story didn't need a kitchen sink thrown in FFS. Not to mention the over-the-top climax and tidy little ending wrapped up in a bow. Some stories don't need to end well. This was one of them. As twisted as it is, if this was a YA book it would get more stars from me. I enjoy authors who are willing to push the envelope. As it was, this amounts to a decent debut. I'll be interested to see what Gabriel Tallent comes up with next.""",2017-09-19 18:01:42,My Absolute Darling,fiction;young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime,Gabriel Tallent

 In order to prove that NO, I DON'T ONLY READ PORNOS THANK YOU VERY LITTLE I begged Steve to pull me out of my downward spiral and buddy read this one with me. When my husband asked his nightly question ""what are you reading????"" I was so very proud to say a classic rather than smut. I also jumped at the chance to say it was a book written by the author of The Talented Mr. Ripley and that this novel became one of my favorite Hitchcock films. It was at this point my husband pointed out that in the course of our 20 year marriage there has been an annual Alfred Hitchcock movie marathon on Turner Classic Movies and that he was pretty sure the winner of first place in my heart was . . . .

 And . . . . 
 And . . . . 
 And . . .

 It was at this point I reminded him exactly what this story was about . . . . 
 Guy Haines meets Charlie Bruno on a train and shares a meal with him in order to pass the time. I know what you're thinking - WHY THE EFF WOULD ANYONE DO THIS WHEN THEY COULD JUST READ A BOOK?!?!?!? Who knows? It was a different time when men wore hats and ladies had to worry about stuff like whether the seam on their stockings was straight. Basically, people were cray. Anywho, over the course of this dinner between strangers (*shudder*) Guy shares that he's an architect sitting on the cusp of making it big, has a real beaut of a gal he's planning on marrying and that the reason he's on the trip is to finalize a divorce agreement with his first wife. Bruno's story is pretty much that he's a drunk with an Oedipus complex who would like someone to off his dear ol' dad. Which leads us to the offer of a murder swap and Bruno mistaking a clearly stated no for YAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS leading to turnabout being fair play and Guy getting blackmailed into fulfilling his half of the bargain as well. 
 Sounds like a real winner, don't it??? Yeah. It definitely could have been if it were about 100 pages lighter. There just wasn't much to this one aside from the stabby stabby (or in this case the strangley shooty). The majority of the book was just ""meh"" page filler with little character development aside from each respectively losing their marbles. 
 The Hitchcock film, on the other hand? Magnificent. Please remember, however, that this is the man who could sniff out something so brilliant in an itsy-bitsy little 14-pager.

 To be honest, I don't really know what to say. Geek Love has been on my TBR since 2012. I'm fairly certain I even checked it out from the library at one point and returned it without reading.

He also never (or rarely) leaves his house, hence the needs for the youthful and exuberant Archie (who makes good use of the roadster). 
 This little mystery isn't too challenging, but it was a fast and diverting read. Archie's old-fashioned American slang is quite amusing. 
 I may continue with this series.

324,29780253,5,"""If there is one non-fiction, autobiographical memoir that you have to read, make it this one. In fact, if there is one audio book you choose to listen to, make it this one. 
 This was my first foray into the audio book world, and man, was it good. Narrated by Trevor Noah himself, he takes you into an incredible journey back in time during South Africa's apartheid. The different dialects, accents, languages, voices and inflections he uses during his narration are a thing of wonder and beauty. He transports you into his world, he makes you feel everything, and you will find yourself laughing, shaking your head in incredulity and weeping tears of pain and heartbreak - and in no particular order. 
 I never thought of myself as a huge fan of Trevor Noah. I never watched his stand up comedy, and only watched a handful of episodes since he took over from Jon Stewart. I thought he was intelligent and entertaining, but no Jon Stewart. I picked up this book after hearing about it from my sister, who couldn't stop praising it. When I did purchase it, she insisted I listen to the audio book, promising me that it was a 100 times better when you listen to it because you get to truly experience his world and his childhood. So I did. 
 Trevor Noah became my friend during my long commutes to and from work. I was engrossed in his life, and fell in love with his mother, who is my hero in so many ways now. 
 Trevor Noah has a knack at explaining things to you in uncomplicated terms so you leave knowing more than you ever have about pre- and post- Apartheid in South Africa and about the complex system that divided people (white, black and colored), and about the communities he grew up in. He allows you to listen to his story and come to your conclusions, make your own judgments, and root for whomever you chose to root for. I always rooted for his mother, and for him. 
 I admit that I enjoyed his early years a lot more than the later ones. I thoroughly enjoyed his interactions with his mother as a child, their conversations, their arguments and their love for each other was a joy to listen to. Being a mother to a naughty boy myself, I found myself relating to his mother in many ways and laughing out loud at how his naughtiness was dealt with. I loved their conversations about Jesus, and you could immediately tell that Noah was quite a clever boy from very early on. The letters they wrote each other when they were fighting about something were simultaneously hilarious and endearing. I cannot begin to tell you how much I loved this book. 
 The last few chapters, when he gets into the business of hustling, were interesting, but I felt it went on for a little too long. It also seemed slightly abrupt how he went from hustling and DJ'ing to comedy. There was never any explanation on how he got into comedy, why he chose that path, or how he started. I would have liked to know more about that part of his life, because we know that when he gets the call from his brother Andrew at the end, he's already doing stand-up, but we don't know when or how it began. 
 The end tore me to pieces. The pain and heartbreak in his voice made my heart twist and squeeze itself and my eyes flood with unshed tears. 
 A beautiful story, told by a wonderful human being. I have a lot of respect for someone who has been through so much pain and struggle to come out a successful and humble person, and to be able to look back at his life and see it from a comedic perspective.""",2017-07-15 10:31:35,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah

The story is told by an older Kvothe himself, to a Chronicle that traveled far and wide to find him. Even if some of the plot elements (e.g. a gifted young kid finding his way to a school of magic) may seem similar to the Harry Potter saga, this book could not be more different. The life of Kvothe is harsh, and here the focus is given to the struggle to survive under adversities, as a homeless youth or a penniless student. There are only two small issues with the book. First the main story is weak and as a result the plot feels episodic. Second, I feel like the stage is not set properly for some of the events.

328,16131466,3,"""See this review and more on The Moonlight Library! 
 I don't normally read erotica, and I wouldn't normally go anywhere near a shapeshifting erotica because that stinks of bestiality to me more often than not (although I'm not totally against the idea of animal form smexitimes), so it is highly irregular that I'd not only be interested in an erotic novella, and one about dragon shifters to boot. 
 However Dead Sexy Dragon had an interesting blurb that drew me in: 
 ""The last thing dragon shifter Stig Wyvern needs is his dead friend's kid sister showing up on his doorstep, especially since he's just minutes away from entering a mating phase. Sharing his isolated house with the young woman he's desperately lusted after for quite some time is a recipe for disaster. 
 But Cora Cardenas has nowhere else to go. She's in deep trouble with some really nasty people and Stig is the only one who can protect her. That he's deliciously sexy and makes her tingle with the simplest of smiles is an added bonus. 
 Cora quickly realizes Stig is hiding something from her. To make matters worse, she's plagued with breathtakingly naughty dreams starring a shadowed lover who bears a startling resemblance to her host. And what the hell is going on in the basement at night? 
 Stig needs to get Cora out of his house but his inner beast has other ideas. He's found his mate and she's not going anywhere."" 
 And then at the end it said: 
 Word count: 25,000 words. 
 BAM! I'm in. A novella-length story means I won't be investing too much time if I end up not enjoying it. 
 So the story is about this guy 
 And this girl called Cora who has a very underdeveloped character but a solid backstory/reason for why she knocks on Stig's door despite having a key and an open invitation. 
 The story is mostly about their sexitimes, which was OK, I guess, as far as sexitimes go. I don't normally read erotica, and my only other experience has been 50 Shades of Grey where I only lasted 4% before throwing my Kindle down in disgust. Some of it was a bit stupid, such as Stig whispering in Cora's ear as she sucks him off, and that made me think he had some secret life as a contortionist no one bothered to tell me about. Some of it was repetitive and stupid. Cora often referred to her vagina as 'her sex', which I thought was stupid, but hey, for my first erotica I don't know any better. 
 Overall the romance was unconvincing but the sex was not. Whilst the characters were underdeveloped they did change by the end of the story (and therefore are three dimensional). I think I like the idea of 'in heat' mating phases, but not so much referring to sex as 'mating'. I'll need to read more in this series before I figure out if I like the dragon shifters being slaves to their sex hormones. In context it works, and it's all consensual. 
 What I did enjoy about this novella was that it had very solid worldbuilding, the two main characters were three dimensional, and the story actually had a plot besides sex. So I guess that's good. 
 But like I said, what do I know? Take any criticism with a grain of salt.

329,363391,4,"""Brought to you by The Moonlight Library! 
 The Yeerks appear to be infesting horses out at Zone 91, a poorly disguised parallel of Area 51 (which is in Nevada but we all know the Animorphs are in California!). What are the Animorphs going to do about it? Why, morph horses, of course! 
 This is one of the better books in the Applegate-written section of the series purely for its comedic value. We don't expect Cassie to be the funny one, but she's run over by a tank as a cockroach and then runs in a thoroughbred race. There are plenty of funny moments in this book as Cassie's naivety comes to the fore - she gives a fake name as ""Cindy Crawford"" and a fake phone number of ""12345678''. Also, Rachel buys her a new outfit, which actually makes other boys notice her, and makes Marco go slightly insane (but did we ever expect anything else?) 
 This is the first book after Tobias has been given his morphing power back, and it demonstrates how awkward it must be for a hawk to go to human places to acquire animals (a racetrack for the horses). Tobias also grumbles a lot about how poor the morphs are in comparison to his own body, or grumbles about being left out. 
 The Yeerks want to know if the rumoured alien technology held at Zone 91 is a threat to them or their invasion, and although they never actually find out what it is, Ax knows and informs the Animorphs. The Yeerks are still desperate enough to attack humans in broad daylight (well, night time, but in a public place) to force an infestation, and Cassie is the one to come up with a plan and foil them. Don't underestimate her. She may be a tree hugger but she's also one of the most ruthless Animorphs. It's dangerous, because she'll look all innocent with her big wide eyes until you realise you've lost a major battle in the war and have to retreat. 
 Cassie is a badass and should not be underestimated.""",2013-03-23 21:28:01,"The Unknown (Animorphs, #14)",fiction;young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;children;mystery;thriller;crime,Katherine Applegate
330,363392,3,"""Brought to you by The Moonlight Library! 
 A prototype Bug fighter crashes into a local supermarket, and the Animorphs decide to steal it and land it on the lawns of the White House. But after a brief tussle with Visser Three's Blade ship, the Animorphs find themselves flung half a day into the past, and trapped in South America. Meanwhile, Jake has been having flashforwards about the jungle, and flashbacks about his normal day. What the heck is going on? 
 Ladies and gentlefucks, allow me to introduce you to a concept we will visit again, so listen up: the Sario Rip. It is a hole in space time. A massive energy explosion caused it, and sent the Animorphs not only back in time but to South America, in the middle of the rainforest, in nothing but their morphing outfits and bare shoes. Fun fun. They have until the time the explosion happened in the first place to re-create the explosion, or else the anomaly, the impossibility to having two of the same people existing in a normal space time continuum, will cause each of the doubles to annihilate themselves. 
 Got it? 
 This novel is actually about what happens when Jake screws up. He doesn't often screw up, but in this case, he does screw up, and he screws up big. Sometimes I wonder if it's fair that the very few times he does monumentally screw up in the series, he's given the chance to undo it all. But I digress. Yes, Jake is the leader. Yes, he gets some good ideas. But ultimately, the Animorphs lose this alternate-universe battle, and that's why Jake's been having flash-forwards-and-backs, and why reality snaps back together to give him the chance to never do any of it. 
 The Animorphs suffer in the rainforest. Applegate does a brilliant job of showing us just how harsh the environment can be. Monster bugs. A million birds. Piranhas. Monkeys. Jaguars. Add in Visser Three, who can morph anything, and a bunch of tireless Hork-Bajir and Taxxons who seem strangely at home in the land of giant insects, and you're pretty much screwed. Unless you, too, can morph anything you touch. And just in time, the Animorphs manage to acquire a jaguar rather conveniently and also learn to appreciate the jungle from a predator's perspective. They have their usual Visser Three fight, where the Visser spends more time taunting than anything else while the Animorphs remain stoically silent, and in the end, Jake kills the Visser using a poisoned spear from a friendly Amazon tribesman. 
 Except that (spoiler) Jake dies, too. So reality snaps back together and Jake changes his mind about going after the bug fighter. It never happens. Except that at the start of the book, Jake gives us the usual, ""This is really happening and everything is true"" spiel, and it never actually happened. 
 So OK. No monkey morphs, no jaguars. No dead Visser Three. Equally, no dead Jake. And a story that never happened, and that no one but Jake remembers. This, ladies and gentlefucks, is what we call a filler novel, and it is the first instance that you can really skip over without missing anything at all. The concept of the Sario rip will be re-explained when it's re-introduced. But overall, it's still an entertaining novel and Applegate's descriptions of the rainforest and her torturing of her characters are well worth the read, even if she does in the end helicopter author them all to safety.""",2013-02-28 18:38:23,"The Forgotten (Animorphs, #11)",fiction;young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;children;mystery;thriller;crime,Katherine Applegate
331,19057,5,"""I picked this book up because of how freaking amazing Markus Zusak's The Book Thief was. So I went in to this book with high expectations and I was not at all disappointed. 
 Ed Kennedy is an underage cab driver who is stuck in a rut of his hopelessly, ordinary life. He's in love with his best friend, plays cards, and yearns for something to add any meaning to his life. That's when the first card arrives. Now Ed is sent across his small town looking into and trying to fix other peoples' broken lives. Throughout it all one question remains: Who is behind the cards? 
 I fell in love with how utterly unextraordinary Ed was in the beginning. He wasn't one of those guys who you'd think would never exist anywhere but in fiction. I could see Ed picking me up in his taxi. And as Ed went around and became a person with a different take on life, I fell in love with how broken he seemed in those moments. How humanely he took it all in. 
 My favorite story Ed learned was Marv's. His story made us understand him and I fell in love with him in the end too because of it. Milla's story broke my heart into a thousand pieces, being the hopeless romantic I am. Richie's motivated me, Sophie's inspired me, and Angelina broke my heart because of the innocence being lost.

335,8262550,3,"""3.5 stars. I may clean this review up, but for now here are my initial thoughts. 
 I thought it was pretty good overall. It ended with a really good finish, and the narrative voice that was bugging me early on in the book was greatly toned down during the last third of the book. (The first half or so of the book felt like I was watching a movie where the actors rarely spoke, instead it was mostly narrated from the authors POV. It was frustrating and pulled me out of the story repeatedly.) But the core story between H/h was the better part of this book, and for that I can see why many enjoyed this story. 
 The story centers around the struggles and troubles of a half-Indian man married to a white woman in the late 1800s, and opens with a heart wrenching scene that sets the tone for the rest of the book. You can't help but want Cord and Anne to find peace and happiness despite the obvious struggles they will face. The author does a great job of developing these two and making the reader believe in their relationship, I just wish she would have done the same for the secondary characters. 
 Besides the heavy use of narrative voice to tell this story, the development of some of the secondary characters and their role in the story felt off in places. When it came to Cord and Anne's relationships with their family members, I never fully understood any of the relationships so I had trouble understanding many of their actions. His brothers didn't seem to walk their talk and support Cord or give him the benefit of the doubt when it was painstakingly obvious they would and should. And her family was portrayed so one dimensional it was hard to get a read on where she stood with them much of the time. She should hate them but didn't, yet when she did hate them it seemed for much less offenses. 
 Still, it really was an enjoyable book and I don't regret reading it. Anyone who loves western romances with some grit and a slow-but-steady pace should enjoy it.""",2010-12-30 08:42:29,"Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold (Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold, #1)",history;historical fiction;biography;romance;fiction,Ellen O'Connell

 I truly appreciated the characters - they felt very realistic and the heroine isn't some Mary-Sure. The only weak link was possibly the werewolf hating group if only because they seemed so cliche villains, as well as the love triangle because that has been done to death a million times already. I did figure out the mystery long before the end of the book, but in no way did that dampen my enjoyment.

351,10806008,4,"""Originally reviewed on my blog, Books from Bleh to Basically Amazing. 
 So, I'm going to break one of my personal review rules/no-nos/pet peeves here for Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes by Jonathan Auxier and I'm going to compare it to another book. (Gasp, I know... Also, insert appropriate apology here). The story itself is pretty unique and charming, but I was reminded from the very beginning of A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket. The stories are not anything alike, but the writing felt very similar to me. It's told in that same third party narrative where the narrator will interject at times with 'clarifications' and comments. And it also had that same impossibility of character (like the baby biting through steel in ASoUE). 
 And I don't like it. 
 I did not enjoy the SoUE. I read most of the books and finally gave up because the story just wasn't enough to get me over my dislike of the narration and other... things. But I will say that although the narration was, at times, quite jarring to me, overall, I actually really enjoyed this book. 
 Once I got past the beginning, where the infant is left to fend for itself by the town elders and survives, I found myself really drawn into the happenings of the story. But it was a struggle and initially, I was really disappointed in the story, because I need my fantasy to be believable and realistic, which means I need to believe in my characters. Once Peter has gotten past his unbelievable childhood, the story really picks up for me. I found that I really liked Peter and I wanted so badly for him to succeed. There was so much at stake for him, and he had so little happiness in his young life that I so wanted things to work well for him. 
 The story was quite charming, and again, once past the beginning, this unknown/unseen narrator really does keep his comments and opinions to a minimum, allowing me to get farther into the story. I loved watching Peter learn about his surroundings, learn about himself and realize that he can teach and help others. He worries that his past as a thief makes him unworthy and he often sometimes confidence in himself, which is not surprising considering he's spent the last several years being told he's practically worthless. But Peter is strong and he is made of greater things than he knows, and there is much he needs to do in order to complete the quest given him by the mysterious professor. 
 His traveling companion, Sir Tode was also a rather enjoyable character. The victim of a Hag's curse (one that I think you definitely need to discover on your own) Sir Tode is an unlikely companion, but is really willing to be there for Peter, to be his eyes and his friend. 
 I'm so glad that I stuck with this book, that I didn't allow myself to get too discouraged when I started the book. It's a beautifully charming story, even with the narration being what it is. Peter is strong and brave, and although not perfect (for reasons I won't specify to avoid spoilers) Peter's struggles with being blind are raw and real. Peter understands that his skills as a thief are only what they are because of his blindness. He can hear and smell better, and his fingers are far more sensitive. He recognizes this. He knows these things. But he still longs for the ability to see. But he also doesn't dwell on it. It's one of those things, it is what it is, and he makes the best of what he has. I love little Peter. 
 The fantastic eyes were also such an enjoyable part of the story. I wasn't sure going into it, but after reading, I can (fairly confidently) say that this is a stand alone story. I had originally thought that perhaps it would be a trilogy, with one book dedicated, primarily, to one set of eyes, but I am happy to say that this story stands alone. All three eyes are used (and umm, pretty brilliant, if I may say so!) and the story resolves itself completely, in that way of all middle grade (ok, most MG). 
 I think this is a charming and delightful book, and I think it's one that will be enjoyed by many, many people. If you are a fan of Lemony Snicket's writing style, I think you will just love this one. And if you are not, give it a try anyway. It just might surprise you. 
 Oh! Also- I loved the small illustrations that started each chapter. They were fabulous additions to the story and they made me all happy inside. :)""",2011-07-28 22:07:04,"Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes (Peter Nimble, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;children;young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime,Jonathan Auxier
352,14358,3,"""Might have made more sense, and I might have liked it better if I had known it was a series, and read it in order... Still pretty good though. 
 **Update** 
 As I've read over some of my past reviews, I've noticed that I have the tendency to include something along the lines of 'Still pretty good though' with most of the books that I didn't really enjoy reading as long as I didn't actually hate them... It's kind of a lie, and that bothers me. 
 So, I am now going to tell you how I really felt about this book: 
 In some ways I am grateful to this book. It's what clued me in to why I thought I didn't like SciFi and Fantasy for such a long time (but mostly SciFi) It's not that I don't like the genre. I've read several SciFi books that I very much enjoyed. What I don't like is being blindsided by it. If I am going to invest myself in something that dabbles in the realm of science fiction (or fantasy) I need to be prepared for it. Although knowing it was the 4th book in a series would have helped, the real reason I didn't enjoy this book was the random introduction of science fiction. The story begins with a young girl (15?) trying to come to terms with the fact that her beloved grandfather is dying while also trying to win/juggle the affection of 3 boys. One is in love with her, but she just thinks he's a friend, a self-destructive no-good who is always there and probably just wants to get super friendly... and the college student her brother is researching dolphins with whom she is totally crushing on, who in turn really likes her, but knows he shouldn't. So, already it's not really my kind of book. 
 Although I knew I probably wouldn't love it, I'd still be able to enjoy it for what it is. But... the dolphins. Halfway through the story, we realize that Vicky can communicate with dolphins. Telepathically. Oh, wait what?! This book, that was supposed to be just another coming of age story suddenly turns into something different. I feel that I would have enjoyed the story much more had I been warned that there was some SciFi going on. So, I'm warning you. It's there. Be prepared for it. 
 I might return to this book in a while to see if my experience with it will be different now that I know what it contains. Maybe I'll try reading more of the Austin family series. We'll see.

As one does. 
 The first few seance-y scenes are the best in the book; Robin's emo, which makes the first section drag, is finally sidelined, and there's some fun creepy stuff. But there's a lot of the characters being too dumb to realize REALLY OBVIOUS STUFF, and while the evil spirit they've conjured has an interesting and unusual origin story, it's not enough to save the ending from feeling like the slightly sleepy lovechild of The Exorcist and The Shining. Further, the resolution is a little too pat, the-authorities-really-bought-that?-style, and there's also a totally unnecessary epilogue of the you-think-it's-over-but-it's-not-really-over variety. I really appreciate the mere EXISTENCE of a horror novel that has women in active roles, and even being a little bit kickass, but other that the protagonist's gender, this book doesn't really have much to distinguish it from any other scary story.""",2008-01-27 18:20:23,The Harrowing,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime;young-adult,Alexandra Sokoloff

358,186074,3,"""This book for me is many things but I believe it's most serious crime is the way the author choose to put the book together. I guess that working for something for many years may have that affect on people specially when the world is complex. That is no excuse. There is no excuse for Kovte's story to be the way it is. 
 I understand that he is narrating events of a life story but most of it was info-dumping. Sure, he can say that 4 talents is much, more that he can own but honestly I can't tell that because I don't understand how the monetary transactions works. Or the magic. Or anything in this forsaken book. And the author does nothing besides blabbering alien terms in the hope I get amazed how much Kovte knows by how ignorant I am on the subject. I am not pleased. And those breaks in between chapters are not only frustrating down the line but they actually take you away from the book, it broke the magic. 
 And let's talk about the size.... It's a specimen in which the pages are filled with events that are, for lack of better term, fillers. I didn't feel the life lessons, it didn't made me sympathetic towards the characters, most of the characters disappeared after that and not much remained. Just the preppy cool guy that can do no wrong. (even if it's track record says otherwise)

 This is around where I stopped in my last reread a couple years ago, because this is the last physical Animorphs book currently sitting on my shelf (the rest are in another country, alas). And ahahaha this one is just RIDICULOUS and freakin' hilarious, and I love it -- this time, the Animorphs take on their universe's analogue for Area 51, and it's fantastic. Maybe not as good as the Futurama episode about it, but still good. Marco is a conspiracy nut, Cassie is absolutely godawful at improvising on the fly, and an all-out Yeerk battle unfurling in a theme park is hysterical -- as in, I laughed so hard at one of Visser Three's reactions that I was shaking uncontrollably with muffled laughter on the subway for about 5 minutes, because I kept rereading the same two lines over and over and descending into more gigglefits. The Visser is such an amazingly well-done villain because KAA somehow believably writes him as both utterly terrifying, AND hilarious. 
 The whole book itself, really, is on the lighter and comedic side compared to the heavier subject matter of the previous. The only thing that ground my gears was Cassie talking to the jockey while in horse morph, just to win a race. For all their secrecy about morphing, sometimes the kids are SO FUCKING DUMB about talking to humans. 
 EDIT: I just upped this rating by a star, because in talking to Caitlin about it even weeks later, I still fell into gigglefits thinking about Area 51 and the horses and the theme park. This book is just SO FUNNY.

He's just one last straw away from snapping if the others put too much pressure on him, and it's completely understandable, because it really is an awful burden to put on a kid... and yet they're right to do it: none of the other Animorphs are remotely near right, characterisation-wise, to lead them.

364,14358,0,"""Battle is over for this book, at any rate. 
 Before anyone starts throwing stones or even worse missiles, I have to point out that this is not a review, but rather a response. Furthermore, I read this book at the wrong time. Which is NOT code for saying that it's an immature book you could only love if you read it as a child. But really, rather than desiring to avoid abuse, I hate to say why a book that is an abiding favourite for so many friends is one that really didn't work for me. 
 As a child myself, I read A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, and possibly one or two of L'Engle's others, but not many. The Crosswicks Journal books and Walking on Water I read as an adult and loved. These books spoke in a way that felt deeply authentic, and always seemed right, whether she was talking of love and loss, or imperfection and failure, or grace. When the later controversy arose over the extent to which she'd thrown her own family into her fiction without much concern for their feelings, I didn't really know the fiction that might have been involved, so was just confused and saddened to hear about literary and family conflict for a favourite author. 
 Another thing that had been floating in the back of my head for some years in an unresolved kind of way was what Connie Willis said about L'Engle. (Or at least, I very much hope she said it and I'm not misquoting her!) Even though Willis herself is a believer, she said that Madeleine L'Engle was a Christian apologist before she was a storyteller, and that sometimes that didn't work for a writer. Which just didn't quite make sense, especially after reading Walking on Water and the Crosswicks Journals. 
 Then came the Book Battle and reading A Ring of Endless Light, and those two disparate things fell into place in my head. Nothing about the book felt true or natural to me. I don't just mean that the family seemed too good to be true, with their musical evenings and extreme intellectual superiority. They did, but in an odd way, as if they were Madeleine L'Engle's idealised version of how she and hers were. It also made very clear to me why there might be a question of her family's being upset about appearing in her fiction. Vicky's behaviour, in her family and outside it, felt especially unnatural, and the more we were told that she was special, and a poet, the worst it got. (Seeing the poetry did not fix that.) The thing is, though, that it's often possible to put a problem like my one of finding the family to be unbelievable off to an analytical part of your mind, as long as the story is flowing around it smoothly. This one only flowed for me in a very few places. 
 I'm sure I'd have reacted to the returning characters differently if I'd read the earlier books in the series, so again, I'm acknowledging this is not the usual way to read them. As it was, though, I especially disliked the three-guys-chasing-Vicky plotline, a reaction which included not much liking any of the guys, or, to be honest, Vicky herself. It started to feel as if the author were going for the magic number three (I'll come back to that) and cherry-picking relationships a ""special"" girl like Vicky might encounter for purposes of education. Adam: the serious boy who'll blow hot and cold (except always hot for your usefulness to his scientific pursuits) as he's tugged between the opposing forces of respect (he's got YEARS of post-graduate study before he can MARRY and she's the kind of girl you would only MARRY), guilt (she's too young AND his friend's younger sister) and OMG SHE'S SO SPECIAL (the dolphins know it!!). Leo: a classic. The friend who wants more and you don't want to hurt because you're nice and you care about him but know you'll never be interested in that way, but can't you be friends?? And finally Zachary. Bad boy with the tortured soul extraordinaire. Sexy, sophisticated, handsome, charming (except when he absolutely isn't, but more on that shortly). In theory, it should have worked really well, having intelligent yet insecure (and never as popular with the boys as her younger sister, 'natch) Vicky seen as truly attractive and also showing the real distress each of these relationships could cause a caring and compassionate person. 
 It didn't come off that way for me, though, and the point at which it really hit me enough to throw me out of story-reading into a detached, what IS this? type of reading was after Zachary nearly hits an old woman crossing the road. Zach's already brought Vicky out twice, on wonderful outings, taking her to an exclusive country club (although that might be tautological!) with fancy food, a concert she loves, flying, which she also loves, and here's the significant third time. He picks her up and she has to yell at him to slow down or if he doesn't, to let her out of the car. He does, but then sees an old woman with a cane crossing the road. He says, ""She's no use to society. Shall I mow her down?"" and steps on the accelerator. ""He slammed on the brakes, but not before he'd given the old woman - and me - a good fright."" He then says that Vicky knew he wouldn't hit her, and she replies that with him she never knows, but that's the end of the incident's ramifications. She goes on with the day, enjoying the flying enormously, is taken to a fancy French menu (without even a menu, ""the ultimate in elegance""), is made to ""feel glamorous"", which she likes, and enjoys a ""long, slow kiss"" while being grateful Zach doesn't make anything more of it. This is a day spent with someone who started off by accelerating towards an old and not very mobile woman, making her fear he'll run her down. Just - WHAT??? It's so utterly inconceivable to me that anyone with any decency would scream at Zach to slow down or let her out when he's driving too fast on EMPTY roads, but not do the same when he's purposefully terrified an old woman. Especially as Vicky is presented as a character who's deeply moral if sometimes struggling to figure out what's right in some situations. 
 Suddenly, that number three came back to me. Three guys, the third day's outing with Zachary - and three temptations. I can't quite fit the three temptations of Christ in the desert to the three temptations Zachary offers Vicky, but three there are, nonetheless, and it feels much less fairy tale and more scriptural to me. First, he tempts her with luxuries - the good things money and privilege can offer. She enjoys them thoroughly, even though she has gained enough confidence in herself not to be pushed into drinking alcohol when she doesn't want to. Even Zach's too speedy driving (of an Alfa Romeo, no less) on an earlier trip both terrifies and ""exhilarates"" her. Second, he tempts her with the pleasures of the flesh, to use the old-fashioned term. He's gorgeous, sexy and she really enjoys kissing him, except when thoughts of Adam get in the way. Finally, and most interestingly, she's tempted by the desire to ""save him"". Her grandfather is the one who sees this in her most clearly - or possibly it's just that she trusts him to understand and not immediately judge Zachary - and his advice is characteristically gentle and wise. But, unfortunately, it's not until she feels that Zachary lets her down when she needs him that this desire to save him loses its power. 
 There were many other minor things that bothered me, though some irritated less than they might have because I just gave up and laughed. Of course you all sit around and read Shakespeare at night, and in your world Twelfth Night and The Tempest are as good for a 7-year-old as for the grandfather. I also got a bit of amusement out of thinking of the three guys as the three bears - Zachary too rich, Leo too poor, and Adam just right! (Not that Vicky ever thinks that Leo is too poor, of course, but there's more than a bit of classism in the book, and it's telling that when she hopes she can manage to always be friends with Leo it's because ""He was the kind of person, like his mother, who could always be counted on to be there when you needed him."") Mostly, as well as what I've said about the book not feeling natural, it was strange seeing so many events, discussions and even musical preferences that had been described in the Crosswicks Journals turning up again. I have no idea whether the non-fiction was a more a portrait of the person L'Engle wanted to be, and the family she wanted to have than of who she and they actually were, even if I had any desire to make such a judgment about it. Nor am I saying that my odd reading of A Ring of Endless Light as a structure of lessons, or almost homilies, wrapped around plot and characters that weren't strong enough to hold them together, is anything other than odd. All the same, when I started to write this up, I couldn't stop thinking about the ending of one of Connie Willis's books. (I'll put the title behind a spoiler cut.) Passage 
 . A cross is formed by the masts on the ship coming to rescue the protagonist from the most terrifying void of death. Even though it comes from the same place of belief for Willis and L'Engle, that was earned through story in a way that satisfied me as Vicky's rescue from an emotional void by the dolphins at the end of A Ring of Endless Light utterly failed to do.""",2015-02-15 11:42:40,"A Ring of Endless Light (Austin Family, #4)",young-adult;fiction;fantasy;paranormal;children;romance,Madeleine L'Engle

The main character is the definition of unreliable and suffers from hallucinations, so it's a very surreal read - you get a lot of whiplash trying to figure out what is real and what isn't. I liked this aspect of the book. The ending, however, had one too many twists for me - my eyes were definitely rolling at a few of them. 
 This is a standalone novel, which I appreciate (not every story needs to be a quadrilogy, and this definitely didn't need to be), but because this had to tell a complete story and establish the universe in 400 pages, the word-building was pretty shallow. The evil people are evil because that's the way they are, and the good people are good because they are, but there's not a lot of explanation behind it.

I've read several books about Scott & Zelda Fitzgerald in which Ernest Hemingway plays a minor role, so I enjoyed learning more about his life in Paris early in his writing career. And I especially enjoyed getting to know even a fictionalized version of Hadley Richardson. I'm definitely going to do some more reading about her. 
 I'm not sure what is a spoiler in a book based on a true story, but I hated Pauline, the woman who became Ernest Hemingway's second wife. I hated how she tried to pretend she was still Hadley's friend. I hated that Ernest Hemingway (at least in the novel) tried to make it somehow Hadley's fault this had all happened, and if she'd just pretended not to know he was having an affair, everyone could go on living happily. I'm glad Hadley had a happy second marriage with someone who loved her, and that Hemingway still remembered his love for her at the end of his life.

 So, I don't read a lot of non-fiction or memoirs. It's just not what I normally gravitate toward. However, I've been wanting to dip my toes into more of these and I really like Trevor Noah. I've of course seen him on the Daily Show, and also several stand-up specials he's done where he speaks relatively openly about his upbringing. 
 This book expands on that in an incredibly candid way. We learn about the history of South Africa and the disgusting practice of institutionalized racism (Apartheid). We learn about how he was able to navigate this society where he never felt like he belonged because of the circumstance surrounding his birth. And we learn about his amazing relationship with his mother, a woman who is strict, stubborn, determined, loving, devout, and fierce in her convictions. 
 I loved the way he structured this book. It skips around to different time periods in his life, but it never feels choppy or confusing. There is a really steady pacing and the stories tie back into each other really nicely. 
 I also loved the tone of this book. There are some truly awful things described in this book. I can't even imagine what it must have been like to actually grow up like this. The fact that he is able to relate these stories in such a straightforward and candid manner while not coming off as dismissive or flippant is very compelling. The intense things are still intense. But for him, that was just the way it was, and the book's tone reflects that very well, in my opinion.

 This book was slightly better than the first. I still think the idea of the series is really cool, but I don't like how the authors use stereotypical teen language. In this book they let up on that a little bit, which made the book a better read. But, I don't like the direction the authors are using for Zoey. She is starting to be kinda bitchy towards her loyal friends. She snaps at them all the time. Which they do not deserve. I think she's starting to get the idea that since she has a bunch of nifty powers and is training to be a high priestess that she is the boss of their little group. When Stevie Rae died it seemed that she felt that it was everyone's job to look after her and help her move on. I understand that they wee BFFs and roommates, but the others had known Stevie Rae longer and were hurting too. I think she could have done a better job in comforting her friends. I also didn't like that she got involved with three guys so soon. I think the authors should have spaced out her love interests a bit more. I'm disappointed with how the authors are making Zoey.

 I won't kid you. The book takes a while to get going. Rothfuss has a detail-rich style of writing, very much in the style of Tolkien or even Frank Herbert. If you're looking for fast-paced action and a quick read, this isn't it. But there's a beauty in all the details that is worth the time spent to read this book. There's also the storytelling aspect that I really like. Rothfuss weaves an epic tale with classic themes and motifs. 
 The bulk of the book is in fact a tale, as told by Kvothe, a famous or possibly infamous hero now hiding in a tiny village as an innkeeper. The book doesn't even touch on how or why he's there, instead focusing on his childhood and first years at the university where he learned sympathy, this world's version of magic. There are secrets and things that are not what they appear, including demons that are fae, and a fire-breathing dragon which is really just more of a lizard. There's also an epic love tale and a coming of age. More, there are hints of things to come, including the elusive Chandrian who seek out and destroy any who even mention them, including Kvothe's parents and entire caravan. I like the idea that there's an unseen world hiding behind the world everyone knows, and Kvothe is uncovering it one secret at a time. 
 Dedicated fantasy readers will love this book. I wouldn't recommend it to those new to the genre. This is a five course meal, make no mistake.

383,175243,4,"""Audiobook Review: 
 It took a bit of perseverance at the start. The intro salvo of this book is a long prologue worth a chapter and a half of mishmash of unrelated events which won't make sense until later on in the book. It didn't make real sense so I couldn't get into it despite having read Book 1 and knowing that this author has a compelling voice... slooow start kinda book.... 
 Being a visual reader, book covers play a significant role in my reading habit. I like the audio cover art as opposed to the paperback cover art. If I wasn't already a John Connolly fan, I would never buy the paperback. But even if I haven't read John Connolly yet, the audio cover art would have triggered my book buying radar. It's the mysticism with the gritty crime that draws me in. Just pure crime is not as much fun for me as the mystical crime that the audibook cover art implies. And the story telling quality IS compelling. To lure me into crime is not easy because I am a die-hard fantasy geek, so that tells you just how good the story telling quality must have been to make me a John Connolly fan. This book also reminded me why I am not a crime fiction fan though. I am a wuss, okey! I don't like gory killings. I am an escapist reader. I don't want to know about the state of the world or anything about the human nature. I want to escape reality. So gory murders is not the way to this reader's heart. And yes, this book is a gory crime fiction... But, if the story telling quality is masterful enough, I can be persuaded.... 
 This book also reminded me why I like angsty heroes. Yeah, they are fun with the right story teller. Charlie makes mistakes. Just like the rest of us. But he is not too stupid to live like Sookie Stackhouse. Just human enough for a reader to make a solid connection with. I would rate the character development a 5 out of 5. 
 At the end of it, I enjoyed this book despite it being a gory crime fiction and would definitely be reading the next Charlie Parker book.

386,13872,3,"""I was worried this book would be incredibly ableist, but (as someone who is not disabled), I didn't read anything that made me uncomfortable for that reason. Instead, the book chooses to focus on cultural opinions on beauty and how they provide (or remove) social power in different ways. Olympia, the narrator, is proud of her body precisely because it sets her apart from others and elevates her to a living, breathing art form. She is undeniably different. She's also acutely aware of people's reactions to her body and uses this to her full advantage in immensely clever ways. The central question is about the costs of assimilating in order to blend in, and the pros and cons of not having the choice to assimilate at all. 
 I'm glad this book exists and that it treats its subject matter and characters with such respect, but I was really let down by both climaxes. I found both to be boring and was confused by what was even happening. I never fully understood any characters' motives in creating the climaxes in the first place. They were just sort of... anticlimactic and obtuse as climaxes go.

 STORY 
 Because I listened to this audiobook, I wasted 7 hours of my life that I'll never get back! Listening to this book was a complete waste of my time! There was absolutely nothing unique or special about this book. The two main characters have deep feelings for each other yet for a prolonged period of time, numerous (often ridiculous) obstacles get in the way of them having a relationship. I can appreciate an angst-filled romance if the angst is believable but there wasn't anything solid about the drama in their storyline. Everything was extremely predictable and when we are led to believe that something catastrophic is about to happen, nothing does. It was extremely disappointing and I doubt I will ever read anything by this author again. 
 PERFORMANCE 
 Narrator Lauren Sweet isn't a horrible actress but her voice is so excessively nasally and whiny that it was often difficult to listen to. When she used exaggerated cheerleader-style voices while speaking for several female characters, I considered quitting the audiobook and buying the e-book instead yet was able to persevere. Not nearly as bad but just as annoying was how she mispronounced words such as Ibuprofen (pronouncing it, eye-boo-pro-fin"" instead of, ""eye-byou-pro-fin"").

 I enjoyed this book more than any other book in this series. Like the others, INNOCENCE #3 does not contain unexpected twists or awe inspiring, jaw dropping plots that I have learned to expect from Alessandra Torre, yet this book came closer than the others. The huge difference between the first book in the series and this one is remarkable. I don't know how Ms. Torre did it or if she was changed in someway during the years between these books but it's almost like a lightbulb went off and history was made.... in this book, I finally saw the clever, unique Torre writing style I love. Also impressive in this third and final installment is the incredibly erotic, descriptive, HOT HOT HOT sex scenes! At times, it was impossible not to, ""see"" an image of the characters and what they were doing due to Ms. Torre's uncanny ability to articulate every nuance, position, sound, etc. Alessandra, you rocked the sex world in this book! And, true colors came out; The creative story line demonstrates that you are capable of writing more than a basic, average romance! 
 I listened to INNOCENCE#1-3 via Audible audiobooks. The first 2 books were narrated by MacKenie Cartwright; I had given her performance 5 star ratings for each of the first two books. However, after listening to Devra Woodward narrate this book, I can't imagine anyone else capable of filling this role (sorry MacKenzie)!

 What a delightful book! This is my first book by Valerie Bowman but it will definitely not be my last, The Untamed Earl is the fifth book in the Playful Brides series. I have so much catching up to do and I'm so excited to read about the other brides! 
 This is Alexandra and Owen's book, Alex recently had her coming out ball but although she's been introduced to the ton she can't marry until her older sister, Lavinia has been married off. But don't worry Alex already has her eye on the infamous Lord Owen Monroe and as soon as she's able, will marry him and live blissfully ever after. Imagine her dismay when she eavesdrops on her parents while they are planning Lavinia and Owen's betrothal! 
 One of the accomplishments, Alex would like to achieve: 
 ""Marry my true love. Must be handsome, dashing, witty, kind, true and honorable. Name to be determined later."" 
 What ensues Alex's diabolical plan which includes thwarting Lord Owen's attempts at courting Lavinia and ensuring that Lord Owen finally notices her therefore falling hopelessly in love with her! 
 I feel like shouting ""Another!"" like Thor lol. Alex stole the show to be quite honest, I've decided I'm adding her to my list of funny, intelligent and sweet heroines! 
 *walks off to make list* 
 Owen enlisted the help of Alex in winning over Lavinia, but I'm sure he never expected her to tell him exactly what wouldn't make her fall in love with him! I was in stitches! 
 ""I'd ask you to dance, but I have a feeling you'd say no."" 
 ""You're correct, my lord."" Lavinia replied. 
 ""Would you care for a rock?"" 
 ""Lavinia gave him a look that clearly indicated he might have lost his mind. 
 Alex was shameless in her pursuit of Owen, and rightfully since Owen needed quite the nudge to realise his feelings. Lavinia was an absolute ogre, oh my goodness I can't even begin to explain what a terrible person she was. And while reading I'd thought perhaps she could redeem herself in another book but I'm not sure I want her to! 
 I also loved ""The Playful Brides"" who took Alex under their wing! Cass, Lucy and Jane were so entertaining and were one of the reasons I decided to read the rest of this series! 
 I'd definitely recommend The Untamed Earl to anyone looking for a light, playful and funny historical romance!

 Well seriously I have no idea how to review this one... Quite frankly I've never read a Biker romance like this. I'm not even sure if I should call it a romance, yes there's love and a lot of sex but I hesistate to call it a romance. This book was some kind of effed up, the characters and their lifestyle was depraved to the max. They weren't easily likable, the stuff they did was selfish and quite frankly unbelievable, but for some reason I also feel quite protective of them I although I can't sympathise with them, I can most certainly empathise. 
 Jenna is saved from a life that would have probably ended in a brutal death. The man who saves her walks in on a horrific scene, 16 year old Jenna is being beaten and raped by two men. Unfortunately this has been happening for sometime. He brings her to his home and MC, a place that is a lot more different than the one she came from. 
 Her new life begins, she now has a mother and father figure, and although her past is one that's robbed her of her innocence she doesn't let that stop her from living and enjoying her new life. She quickly latches on to Kid the future president of the Renegades. He dotes on her, he's protective of her but when their friendship takes a turn and lust says ""Hello I'm here"" things get beyond f#cked up. 
 Kid and Jenna are self-destructive, Kid's guilt over his lust for an under age girl pushes him into acting like a f#ck-wit. He screws around and waves all his floozies in Jenna's face. Jenna retaliates by finding love else where which infuriates Kid. Yes she sleeps around, and quite frankly it was a low point for her, but Kid made up for it in spades. 
 Lastly Renegade Lady isn't an easy book to read, the characters aren't easy to like but it is a captivating story. There are no fairytale endings with red bows on top, the ending is a good one, but it also suits this story and it's characters. 
 I like this gif, it has nothing to do with this story :)

 This book was the epitome of a romcom!!! I enjoyed reading it so much, I was in fits of laughter! Emma is one seriously sassy chick, who knows what she wants and makes no apologies when she goes after it! 
 Luke is a hot as sin, bad ass tattoo artist, who, when he sees Emma walk into his shop for the first time is immediately drawn to her and doesn't even try to hide it! Make no mistake Emma is just as attracted to him as he is to her. But is held back by a previous relationship gone ugly. But Luke won't have that and makes it his goal to have Emma in his bed. 
 Emma puts up a little bit of a fight but ultimately gives in to his indisputable prowess! Emma made me laugh so hard, her internal dialogue is crazy! 
 There were quite a few characters in this story and they all brought something to the story. Emma's family was absolutely wonderful and so cute. The scene where Emma's sister calls her because she thinks her husband is cheating on her was hilarious! 
 Her brother Calland was your textbook annoying little brother and he proved himself every chance he could get! Emma and Luke together were absolutely hottt! I thought their first time was hot and then Emma had to say ""Show me your dark side Luke!"" And boy did he show her!!! God I love dominant men!!! Okay so I don't wanna ruin the story for you guys but there was one scene where everyone had been watching T.V. and then they all fell asleep in front of the T.V. My poor prudish heart was at first like... 
 and then I was like... 
 Hahaha!!! Totally didn't see that one coming! 
 Okay why did I only give this book 3.5 Stars you ask? 
 I felt like the story was finished at about 60%, nothing more to say here. You no finished! But there was the unfinished issue of a stalker. Emma has a stalker, obviously this is quite serious. But I felt like it was abandoned, I mean there were a few dropped calls, some heavy breathing and a few presents. But not once did Emma feel the need to tell Luke about it! I mean WTF??? 
 I won't go into further detail but the issue was ultimately resolved obviously because this story does have a happy ending. But before it was resolved, we were told some unnecessary crap by Emma. It didn't slowly lead up to the climax, it was just a bunch of scenes right near the end of the book. I didn't see the point, a lot of what happened could have happened much earlier on. So that's why I took one and a half stars off. 
 But although it was annoying the book was enjoyable. I would definitely recommend reading it. It was light, funny and the writing style flowed well. I felt like I was listening to a friend tell me about her super hot boyfriend and their amazing sex life!

 A raw Batman, an even more raw James Gordon (as grey a good cop can get) and a glimpse at a Cat: this book packs a punch on every page. It is gritty, fast, juicy, sordid, raw, tout and entirely amazing - a gripping story with searing writing. 
 Sample this: 'I take the ugly weight off my hip......I hold it up like a dead rat and pray that the man understands.' All this time, Gordon was talking about a gun!

398,186074,4,"""This book was interesting. Can't say I can entirely see why it's one of the hottest things in fantasy, but I respect a novel that isn't afraid to just go along describing a character's life, even the more ordinary parts. The writing was a high enough standard to sustain a pretty slow-moving plot and keep it entertaining. 
 I'm not as attached to Kvothe as I'd like, though. I liked him, but I just didn't feel as...familiar with him as some of my favourite fantasy main characters. I think it's because he was introduced as Wonder Boy; normally I like to see that build in a character. He wasn't annoying or anything, but considering the plot is his life story, I would have needed to feel more attached to him to give the book 5 stars.""",2012-08-07 10:16:28,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
399,32620360,5,"""Wish You Were Here by Renee Carlino 
 5 stars!!! 
 ""How long have we been in love?"" 
 Wish You Were Here will be on my 2017 favourites shelf at the end of the year, without a doubt. There was so much about this book that I fell in love with and Renee Carlino has proven once again that she never fails to deliver. Wish You Were Here was simply stunning, a breath-taking story about love and loss, soul mates and lightening striking twice. This story was incredibly moving, extremely poignant and just an awe-inspiring piece of writing from the very beginning. 
 ""Do you believe in soul mates, Charlotte?"" 
 ""I think so..."" 
 ""Do you want to know what I think?"" 
 ""What?"" 
 ""I think we have soul mates, but I think we can have more than one..."" 
 Many, many tears were shed reading this book, the prose incredibly moving and Renee Carlino extracted all those emotions with effortless ease. The character connection was on point, the dialogue was simply perfect and the humour interspersed with emotional prose was the perfect balance. Renee Carlino captured her characters perfectly and brought them to life over the pages to the point where you become the voyeur looking in. I felt that I was an innocent bystander watching the lives of these characters play out before my eyes and it is that connection that makes this book all the more consuming. 
 I don't want to go into the plot at all as I do not want to spoil it for anyone and this is one book that you need to read as the author intended. This is a book all about the journey and you need to experience this one word for word and let Renee Carlino's flawless writing envelope and consume you as much as it did me. 
 Charlotte was flighty by nature, in her late twenties, starting and abandoning many university courses and never having found her purpose in life, she is a little lost. Men are not top of her priority list either, many failed relationships have led to her being extremely jaded and second guessing her ability to be loved. One night she meets Adam, and totally out of character has a one-night stand she will never forget. They had a connection, one she has never felt before and one she fears she will never feel again. 
 ""That's what happens when you live it well, right? When you have someone to love? It goes by fast. You blink and it's over."" 
 Adam is a character that will remain with me for a very, very long time and that is all I am going to say about our lawyer/artist. Other than he was simply adorable on so many levels. The growth in Charlotte throughout this book was amazing. In the beginning, she was a little hard to warm up to, but as she grew, so did my feelings towards her. Charlotte's heart shone throughout this book and it is her selflessness that ingratiates her to the reader. 
 ""Because I don't want you to stop asking."" 
 This book was simply stunning, it took turns I never saw coming and some that I did. As I said above, flawlessly written, emotional, poignant and one heck of a fantastic read. Simply adored it. 
 ""...you were my one.""

400,31549837,5,"""A Love Letter to Whiskey by Kandi Steiner 
 5 stars!!! 
 ""...no one warned me that once a whiskey girl, always a whiskey girl."" 
 This was my first read by Kandi Steiner and it definitely won't be my last, in fact, this book is one of my favourite reads of the year. Anyone that follows my reviews know I am an emotional reader, I relish an emotional read that will make me cry, I crave that emotional connection to a book, to characters, to their story as a whole and Kandi Steiner delivered this in spades, boy did she deliver. 
 ""Words don't get written from a heart that's never felt. They come from pain, from love, from unspeakable depths - and they were my only release."" 
 Character connection, man did these characters come to life, from the first few lines Kandi Steiner held me captive for an entire book. I had been in a funk, I had tried to read for a fair few days, nothing caught my attention and for a girl that reads a book a day this was seriously bad, but I picked up A Love Letter to Whiskey and Kandi Steiner brought my mojo back with a vengeance. I devoured this book, I cried A LOT, I was frustrated A LOT but most of all, I loved A LOT. This is one angsty ride, one of the most angst filled books I have read in a while and I needed it. Those tears were cathartic, this story consumed me and for the first time in a while I escaped and these characters are ones that have a permanent place in my heart. They earned it. 
 ""Jamie was never officially mine, but I had always been his - ever since the first taste."" 
 This book is filled with raw emotion, thoughts, feelings and actions that hit exactly where the author intended. Where two people that were destined to be together were their own worst enemy. The time was never right, their minds were never in the right place, but their hearts were, their hearts belonged to one and other. This story spans a decade, a decade of friendship, of love, of heart ache. A decade of hiding feelings and depriving the heart of who the heart wants, a decade of miscommunication, a decade of fear, a decade of tangible desire, lust and love seemingly unreciprocated by either party. Their frustrating walls that they both had erected were the biggest obstacle, one that I wanted to rip down brick by brick, but I needn't have bothered, because Kandi Steiner did it for me, eloquently, beautifully, perfectly, frustratingly, agonisingly, tortuously slowly. But, this book was perfect, this was B and Jamie's story. 
 ""But sometimes, even when we know something is bad for us, we do it anyway. Maybe for the thrill, maybe to cure our curiosity, or maybe just to lie to ourselves a little longer."" 
 B and Jamie first become friends in high school, it was unusual for best friends to be the opposite sex, but these two just worked. Their friendship was tangible but you always knew that the chemistry they shared blurred the lines of friendship but these two were stubborn. A love born from friendship though is extremely special, you know that person inside out, you love them for their strengths and you love them for their weaknesses, you love them for their flaws and you love them fiercely and these two definitely did that. Sometimes too much love can be a bad thing and for me their fear of crossing that line and tarnishing what they had was the one thing that held them back rather than being the bungee cord that bound them together. 
 ""It turned out a Whiskey stain was just as permanent as ink, and I wondered if I would every truly was myself clean. Or if I even wanted to."" 
 This book is brutal, emotionally brutal, my heart felt decimated so many times throughout but this was an honest portrayal of one of the most epic love stories I have read. The characters were real, their actions were real, their thoughts were real and it was this that made it that much more relatable. Their actions were not out of the realms of possibility, it could happen to anyone, it does happen ALL THE TIME and knowing this is what really captures your heart and pulls at every single heart string. I lived this book, I breathed this book, I felt everything in this book, these characters totally consumed me for hours. I had palpitations, I screamed, I wanted to batter these two but most of all, I loved them, wholly and implicitly. Both were adorable, both were pig headed, both annoyed the hell out of me at times, but both of them loved each other. Their love was at the end of the rainbow, neither chancing to find its end, they get there but will it all be too late? 
 ""I'm sorry that up until now, I saw you as something I should quit instead of something I should fight for."" 
 I loved the references to Whiskey, for B, Jamie was Whiskey and the references to B's love of Jamie and its connection to Whiskey the drink made for some truly memorable quotes. I cannot say anything negative about this book, for me it was perfection, in truth I could say I want more, but that is a good thing, I didn't want to let these characters go. I wanted to stay in my B and Whiskey bubble. 
 ""Sometimes we're more terrified of the good things in life than we are of the bad. We feel we don't deserve them, or that they aren't real, that they'll disappear quickly and easily and we'll be left in the ruins."" 
 So in summary, if you want an emotional, angsty, beautiful, frustrating, epic read, then this is your book. Have tissues and a large glass of your favourite tipple to hand, bubble wrap your kindle, kick back and enjoy, I did and I still haven't recovered.

401,24890983,4,"""By Any Other Name (Forbidden #1) by JM Darhower 
 4.5 stars!! 
 ""Their families didn't just carry animosity - they were mortal enemies, hell-bent on destroying each other. The two of them were a disaster waiting to happen, and they had just been fooling themselves if they thought anything good could come out of this thing."" 
 There is no doubt in my mind that JM Darhower is the queen of Mafia, no matter the story JM Darhower always manages to draw me in to this corrupt underground and always leaves me salivating for more at the end. 
 There is nothing like a forbidden love story and throw into the mix that the end consequence is literally life or death, then the term ""forbidden"" takes on a whole new meaning. JM Darhower weaves a tale full of suspense and intrigue, a modern twist on Romeo and Juliet where the romance was condemned even before it began. A connection that was born as strangers but when identities are revealed the world crashes down, a connection and love so fierce and intense, that no matter the consequences they just couldn't stay away. Could they get away with it or would this be the end for them and their families? 
 ""It's too late for me, though. I already looked the soul-stealer in the eyes."" 
 This book is centred around the Barsanti's and the Galante's, two Mafia families in New York that were once friends but their friendship turned deadly and toxic sixteen years ago. Through bloodshed, death and violence the families would never recover and an intense rivalry and mafia war was born. 
 ""The only good Barsanti is a dead Barsanti."" 
 Matty-B (Matteo Barsanti) has tried to stay away from ""the family business,"" having been sent away for his own protection initially he has never wanted to be a part of his father's business. However, a sick mother brings him back to New York and having been away for so long means that he is way out the loop and does not recognise anyone anymore. He went away a child and has come back a man. 
 Genna was the only Galante daughter and as such was intensely protected and sheltered. But when that protection becomes over bearing, she acts out as a small act of defiance against her father. Her father calls her bluff though and lets her take punishment for her misdemeanours. It is while stuck in an elevator at the court house that Genna and Matty meet. 
 Through Matty's absence and Genna's ""protection"" neither one recognises the other. Neither one realises that they are fraternizing with the enemy. With only being on a first named basis the penny doesn't drop and over drinks and a coupling that goes totally against their norm a connection is born that is so strong and so magnetising, neither one can stay away from the other despite trying. 
 ""He played her body like an instrument, plucking her strings and stroking her keys, leaving her a quivering mess yet again."" 
 While reading, you know that nothing good can come of this union, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, just waiting for the war to begin, just waiting for the repercussions and I was constantly dreading the fall out. I read as slowly as I possibly could so that I could devour every word, every emotion. While their connection was kind of insta lust in the beginning, their relationship develops slowly, all cloak and dagger and subterfuge. It is this lure of the forbidden that keeps those pages turning, that draws you into their relationship so deep that you cannot let go. I had an intense connection to these two characters; neither were interested in what the family did and what they were doing. This was the first time that either of them had found love and why should two surnames keep them away from what they both wanted? Why should a family war keep them from what they desired, keep them from who they love? 
 ""But that's all there is...The after. Every moment is just the aftermath of whatever came before it."" 
 This is a story about families, loyalty, loathing, turf wars, protection, trust and love. A story that could never have a fairy tale ending but would the protagonists die trying? Families so intent on destroying each other that they cannot see the bigger picture. Where that intense rivalry, clouds judgements and actions and can only end one way...the wrong way. 
 This was a rollercoaster ride; I ran the gamut of emotions, fear being the most prevalent. I was constantly anxious, my heart was beating erratically and I desperately didn't want this book to end. I loved Matty's fierce love for Genna, his protectiveness and willingness to put everything on the line for the one thing that he has forever desired, to be loved. Seeing that reciprocated only makes you warm to them even more, you cannot help but champion these two, you are constantly willing love to conquer all, even with that deep dread seated in the pit of your stomach. 
 ""They were merely standing in the eye of the hurricane...and it only stayed calm for so long."" 
 Once again JM Darhower has nailed it and I cannot wait to read more of this series. Bring it on!

403,15847757,5,"""Iniquity (The Premonition Series #5) by Amy Bartol 
 5 stars!! 
 ""All you have done is create a debt to iniquity."" 
 This was a book I have been waiting years for yet when the time was approaching for its release I didn't want to read. Sometimes you become so attached to a series that when the end is in sight you really don't want to read because you know it will be the last and that is exactly how I felt when I picked up this book. 
 ""I'm the light to his darkness. There's no escape; he's a part of me."" 
 This series was also a first for me, this was my first paranormal read ever. It was a genre I had body swerved at every opportunity yet an author I trusted said you must read it and from that point on my love of everything Amy Bartol was born. I fell in love with her writing voice, the vivid descriptions, these worlds, languages and characters that are all borne from Amy Bartol's imagination. A world that she creates with flair and becomes so real you cannot help but envelope yourself in these characters lives and battles. This is one series that I would love to see on the big screen, I can picture it now, it would be totally EPIC! 
 ""My wings spread wide, like a red stain beyond my pale skin. I'm dancing now for the thrill of it."" 
 So...this is the end...this was an extremely bittersweet read and I savoured every word. I read the slowest I have ever read so I didn't miss a thing. I received so many answers and they were all delivered with clarity and acceptance. We finally get to really understand the connections between the characters, especially Evie and Reed, Xavier, Russell and Brennus. Each character has a pivotal role in Evie's development and her cause and I expected nothing less. Every person had their part to play and in this epic culmination of this series Amy Bartol explained everything in depth and with at times heart wrenching clarity. No matter what team you were on I feel the end was true to the characters that we have become to love throughout this series. 
 ""I'm clutching the invisible thread that binds me to her. I won't let her go, not for anything in this world."" 
 I always knew that this series was going to end up in the mother of all battles and I wasn't disappointed. Sheol and Heaven come to blows in one of the most descriptive and visceral scenes I have ever come across in words. I could picture it all, I imagined it all and I definitely felt it all. Yes, I cried, but as you know I am a soft sap but again that is testament to Amy Bartol's writing, I have such an affinity for these characters that I couldn't help but live their lives together with their emotional and physical distress. Amy Bartol really brought this series to a magnificent crescendo and this is one series that I will never ever forget and will definitely be re-reading. 
 ""Most souls, when they emerge from their bodies, are luminous, the brighter the light, the more vibrant the soul. There's an absence of illumination from Emil as he claws his way from his corpse. He's a black hole devouring radiance."" 
 I am not going to go into anything with regards to plot because that would be criminal. Is there a happy ever after...yes but the last few paragraphs really make you think? Personally I don't think that this was an attempt to prolong this series at all but was more a shout out to those fans that had supported this particular character throughout the series, it will certainly be a topic for many discussions and probably many an outrage but for me, Evie's story came full circle and she had finally found her feet and her purpose in life. 
 ""Your tristitiae - I'm your sorrow."" 
 ""No,"" Brennus says with eyes softening for a moment. 
 ""Ye're me love."" 
 I have to give a shout out to Brennus, while I was never on his ""team"" I never once doubted his affections and intentions towards Evie but Amy Bartol really brought to life this arrogant, Irish, fallen faerie. His dialect had me crying with laughter at times and his witty one liners really balanced this book with much needed entertainment, I have to say he had some of the best quotes in this book and I have to admit I have an extremely soft spot for him. 
 ""When ye get back, come find me mo chroi. I've healed ye...now wake up and banjax whoever banished ye here..."" 
 Reed and Evie together were a formidable force and once again my heart and soul were with this fearless couple. With their band of friends that have always been there for each other this little army were as tight as ever and always had each other's backs. Russell, Zee, Buns and Brownie all have their parts to play and their solidarity towards one another was great to read especially when the odds are stacked against them. 
 ""I could no more leave you than the earth could leave the sun. You'll always draw me back to you."" 
 With the past coming back to fight another day this team have a lot of demons to battle but I loved the unity that Amy Bartol brought to this finale. Even those perceived as unredeemable proved themselves when the chips were down and this really wrapped up this fight between good and evil. 
 ""I made her stronger. I made her the perfect adversary. I'm the Yin to her Yang. She's the light that cannot exist without my darkness."" 
 To say I have loved this series would be an epic understatement and while I am seriously gutted it is over I hope that one day Amy Bartol may bring them to life once again.

404,17325147,5,"""Left Drowning by Jessica Park 
 5 ugly crying, puffy eyed, nose running inducing stars!! 
 OMG OMG OMG, I have to write this straight away whilst I am emotionally distraught, I cannot convey how much I cried whilst reading this book...I should really post a picture of the mess of a face I was left with but I wouldn't want to scare you all away, but I was a total and utter wreck. I am an emotional person anyways and I do cry fairly easily, but this was embarrassing. It wasn't even as if the event that triggered this total and utter sob fest was ""that bad"" but I was so pulled into this story emotionally and mentally it felt like my own heart was breaking, no scratch that, it was ripped out, stamped out, stabbed a few times and tossed in the trash. Jessica Park, you killed me.....I am distraught, I have run out of tissues and my husband thinks I am an utter fruit loop, but other than that I am OK, just. 
 This book pulls you in from the dedication:- 
 ""For Tommy, who is and will always be, my Sabin. 
 This book is for everyone who has survived. You are not broken. You can love and be loved, depite what may feel like the eternally brutal nature of the world. Even when you're drowning and so far under, there is always time to reach for someone who will teach you how to breathe again."" 
 I was not sure what to expect when I started reading this, after reading Flat Out Love and Flat Out Matt I was thinking it would be another one of those quirky books that suits Jessica's personality to a T, we have seen her wicked sense of humour all over Facebook, she cracks me up daily but this was sooooo different. This book was deep, meaningful, emotional, beautifully written and most of all captivating, I could not put it down. 
 Blythe, beautiful, brilliant, Blythe, she was still grieving for a lot of things, the loss of her parents four years earlier and also the loss of her relationship with her brother. That tragic night had destroyed everything that Blythe knew, she took herself off to Uni and made sure that she was unnoticeable. She kept herself to herself, did not have a roommate, never socialised, just plodded through the crap that was her life, she felt she was a nothing, no use to anyone, she would drink herself into stupors just to forget, just to try and be something even just for a short while, but it never worked, it was always so much worse in the mornings. She goes for a stroll and happens to chance upon a man at the lake, she stares, she watches, she feels that there is some instant connection to this stranger and she feels pulled. Unlike Blythe in any shape or form she makes a move and talks. 
 Chris, the said stranger, he too a broken soul, we always knew he was hiding something, but Jessica leaks his past slowly throughout the book and it just adds to the suspense of the story. I did have an inkling as to where the plot twist would come and I was right, but as it was revealed my heart just broke all over again. It is like a car crash, you can see it happening and you just brace yourself for the impact, but when it hits you, you feel the shock and the pain, then you freeze....you pat yourself down, check that you are OK and then sit back and wonder what the hell just happened. Well, Jessica Park just came up and hit you smack between the eyes!! 
 Some may say that this is a insta love, it is and it isn't, they both feel the connection immediately, but it is not acted upon for a long time. Blythe too scared to say or do anything and Chris wanting to but feels that he is too broken to offer anything. They become friends, along with the rest of the Shepherd family. 
 I love this family, this is where Jessica really gets her wicked sense of humour across, Sabin and Estelle were amazeballs. I love it when a book totally engrosses you with all the side characters and every side character in this book had a major part to play. Some may say Sabin was annoying, he was brilliant, the friendship that he and Blythe built was so touching and so needed for both of them, it was beautiful. Estelle, some may say crazy, but what an amazing best friend, even though she was hurting herself, the strength she passed to Blythe was courageous despite battling her own demons. Eric and Zach, such a cute couple, you just loved them. It was such a tight knit family and they all just welcomed Blythe with open arms. 
 Blythe and Chris ground each other, whilst in the beginning it is Chris that brings Blythe out of her pity party, it soon becomes apparent that Chris needs rescuing from his own and Blythe wants to be the person to do it. The trouble is that Chris, whilst he wants to be rescued, it takes him a long time to realise it, he believes that he cannot be fixed, that he is not worthy and so he does something so incredibly stupid I could have killed him myself...I wanted to jump in the kindle and throttle him. 
 Throughout this book, you feel the connection building, it is palpable, it pulls you in like a moth to a flame and you cannot move away from the light, you keep reading, you become more emotionally invested, you fall in love with the characters, you fall in love with the story and then bam...you are hit by that light, that ugly zap that tries to kill you outright..and boy did it kill me. I was like, no this cannot be happening, this is not what should be happening and you carry on reading like a sadist thinking FFS, this is not blinking happening...but it does and it carries on and you cannot help but continue. 
 But alas, do not worry my dear readers, the world does right its axis eventually but not after you have been eaten, chewed, spat out and left for dead...but it is a truly brilliant read. No matter how many the tears I spilled I could read this over and over and over again...yes I am willing to put myself through that again, but it was a joy to read. 
 This is a story about loss, grief, learning to live again, survival, learning to love and trust and most of all learning to heal and forgive. 
 This review is testament to Jessica's writing, it does cover some hard hitting subjects, especially child abuse but it is done sensitively, thoughtfully but most of all it is heart breaking. You feel everything! It is very difficult for an author to make you feel ""this much"", only a few books have managed to do this to me and I am always shocked when they do, you always know when that happens you have read a brilliant book, and this book is truly brilliant. 
 I cannot recommend this book highly enough, but make sure you have loads of tissues to hand because if you are like me, you are going to need them. 
 Oh and Jessica, I want that T-Shirt......You've hit 70%....now cry like a b***h!!

406,186074,4,"""Once I got over the eye-strain of the teensy weensy print in the paperback, I quite enjoyed this book. The memoir style makes for a nice relationship between the reader and the writing, although it'll be interesting to see how Rothfuss wears the confines he's set for himself re: the setup. (That is to say, the three-day semi-spontaneously-narrated style, as able to be recorded phonetically in shorthand ) 
 Kvothe is a character who feels almost designed to chafe at his audience--absurdly talented, arrogantly aware of it, with a penchant for the dramatic, with a satisfying blend of the heroic/romantic and the prideful/selfish. He is certainly the crown jewel of the book, a testament to considerable effort on Rothfuss's part to create a fantastic but balanced story, of a guy who has certainly made his share of boneheaded moves but is generally resourceful enough to deal with them. 
 Nonetheless, this is quite a long drag of a book, not always well-suited to binge reading. Partly because of the painfully tiny print, I often felt I only had a few chapters in me at a time, and had to slow my pace down to avoid getting totally lost. Which is ironic, because then there were passages that read so PAINFULLY slowly that it felt as though they went on for hours, with nothing to show for it at the end. I suspect loose ends were left dangling for future books to pick up, still, Kvothe's indulgence in a mind-drilling level of detail is not always appreciated. 
 And my main beef is that I think it was a cheap shot to handle the ending that way. He essentially stops cold and says 'Done talking now' and little tweaks in the framework don't really fix that.  That makes it hard to see The Name of the Wind as a self-contained book, and I suspect some serious sequel-teasing the likes of which I've rarely encountered. It smacks a little of both author and narrator abusing the privilege of their roles. Tell them a story, build to your climax, then shut your mouth and walk away. Readers will rightfully feel cheated, and whether it's an artistic choice or not, it's a little mean. I think the transition between books one and two could have been more elegantly handled, even without losing that sense of suspense. But hey, I'm not a published author, or an editor, or anything but a supremely experienced fantasy/sci-fi reader, so maybe I'm supposing too much. 
 Still, The Name of the Wind got me excited about fantasy in a way I haven't been since discovering Brandon Sanderson. Reminding me why it's fun, and why it's cool, and how deeply a well-written work can get me interested in a world of utter fiction. Big names like Goodkind and Jordan have failed to impress me in this way, so kudos to The Name of the Wind and I look forward to finding the time to pick up the sequel...and a pair of reading glasses, probably.""",2015-06-04 11:09:44,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
407,14064,2,"""Okay, that was so not my jams... 
 I get the feeling I'm missing something, because all the top-rated GR reviews seem to adore this book. But in a book this short, it's probably all or nothing. You either really like the ""procedural philosophy/theorizing 80%, action 20%"" formula, or you really don't. (To be clear, I'm counting things like ""driving to Sears"" in that action percentage). And you either get totally turned off by Robert Neville's character, or you find him somehow representative of more than the sum of his vices and don't mind him so much. Guess I'm the type that minds. 
 It's not like I want edge-of-my-seat action sequences or anything, I just don't find it entertaining to read a book that gets all meta- like that. I Am Legend leaps distractingly between sparse descriptions of Neville's day, sparse descriptions of Neville's past, and extended let's-be-all-cerebral-about-this jaunts through philosophy and theory-based pseudo-science and morality and what it all MEANS. The problem is, if I wanted to analyze things to that depth, I would do it myself. Being forced through those particular mental contortions isn't high on my to-do list. So if you loved your college philosophy courses, by all means give I Am Legend a shot. It's a small enough time commitment, after all. But I would much rather have been told a decent story and been left to ponder the finer points of morality and such myself. 
 Even when we get into the ""let's modernize vampires"" sequences, it reads as plodding and overly cerebral. Really, I think it's a product of the way the book's set up. Yes, I understand that we spent the entire book in Neville's head, and that creates a sense of isolation and a oneness of thinking indicative of his ""last man on earth"" status, and all that good stuff. I'm just saying, if you write a book that's essentially one giant internal monologue, it's going to bore some folks. 
 And if the internal monologue is that of an unlikeable character, well, you get yourself a pretty lousy rating. 
 For me, that's really the bottom line--I cannot stand Robert Neville. I can't stand his ""why me"" resigned whining, or his scathing and disgusting views on women, or his self loathing or his drinking problem. I do not want to spend even five pages in his head. I don't want to hear him b*tch and moan to himself as he grows plants, whittles wood, falls down drunk, or other such exciting activities. I don't give a darn whether he lives or dies, how he does it, or what he thinks about doing it. This apathy left me completely cold, even through what I imagine was conceptualized as a dramatic, poignant ending. (Plus having Neville articulate that last line makes the whole thing feel intolerably contrived. Like Matheson came up with a punchline and liked it so much he decided to write a 160-page joke to go with it. ) 
 I actually attempted to listen to the audiobook of I Am Legend about four years ago. I tried three separate times to start it, and gave up all three times because (at no fault of the reader) hearing that repugnant narrative voice spoken aloud was enough to make me want to throw my iPod across the room. So there was bad blood between I Am Legend and me long before I managed to finally pick it up and get through it. 
 So from what I can tell, it's peoples' views on the Neville character that polarize the reviews so much. People who love the book like being in Neville's head. People who hate it can't stand being in Neville's head. I fell into the latter category. I think I Am Legend managed to scrape two stars because by the time I decided I wasn't enjoying the book it was already over. If I'd been put through twice as many pages of that freaking narrative voice, it might've cost another star. But it was short, if not sweet, so I'll gift it the second star.""",2014-03-20 17:46:28,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson
408,59980,5,"""Brief History: 
 To be honest, I have actually first heard about Batman through the 90s cartoon series ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" which apparently, I have actually had my first exposure to the world of comics through so many animated series throughout the 90s. Since I have been reading a lot of comics lately, especially the ""X-Men"" comics, I wanted to try a different comic book series and that is where I started reading up on ""Batman."" So, the first ""Batman"" comic I have actually came upon recently is a little gem that I have just noticed lately and that is ""Batman: Year One"" by Frank Miller along with artwork by David Mazzucchelli along with coloring by Richmond Lewis. ""Batman: Year One"" is truly a brilliant comic book that newer fans of ""Batman"" can easily get into! 
 What is this story about? 
 This story basically retells the origins of Bruce Wayne as Batman as it details Bruce Wayne's first year as Batman and all the struggles he overcomes in his new role as Batman. This story also details about Commissioner James Gordon's first year as a lieutenant of the police force before he became a commissioner. 
 What I loved about this story: 
 Frank Miller's writing: Frank Miller's writing was so amazing and simple to read through, especially if you are new to the ""Batman"" comics and you need a good place to jump right in the series. Frank Miller has created a more modern spin on the origins of Batman without changing the original history of Batman (his parents are killed before him when he was a child and he decides to become the famous caped crusader he is today) and I especially loved the way that Frank Miller details Batman's first year fighting crime as being difficult since Bruce Wayne had difficulties in becoming the crime fighting caped crusader since the public viewed him as a menace the moment he started fighting crime. I also loved the way that Frank Miller shown the months that all of this was taking place from January fourth to December third which gave an extremely detailed timeline of this story. What really interested me about this story was learning about the origins of Commissioner James Gordon since I have not really been exposed to his origins and it was interesting to see how James Gordon actually started out as a lieutenant of a police force that was corrupted by the crimes of Gotham City and how he tried to do his best to protect the citizens of Gotham City from such criminal activities. 
 David Mazzucchelli and Richmond Lewis' artwork: David Mazzucchelli and Richmond Lewis' artwork is simplistic yet gives a dramatic feel to the story, especially during the scenes where the characters are in shadows and they give out an eerie feel to the scene they are associated with, like during the scene where James Gordon is attacked by hit men and Richmond Lewis' red coloring that flashes on the characters' faces makes this scene extremely intense as you can see the pain and sorrow on James Gordon's face. I also loved the shadowing that Richmond Lewis applies to Batman as Batman is usually shown in the dark and the dark shadowing makes him look menacing. 
 What made me feel uncomfortable about this story: 
 The only problem with this comic book novel is that there is some blood in some scenes, especially during the scenes where some of the characters are shot. Also, there is some language in this book that might offend some readers, so if you do not like dark themed books that deal with crimes in the cities, then this graphic novel might be hard to read through. 
 Final Thoughts: 
 Overall, ""Batman: Year One"" is not only a brilliant read for ""Batman"" fans everywhere, but it is also a great place to get into the ""Batman"" comic series, especially for new fans who are just getting into the ""Batman"" comics and want to know how Batman's origins came about!

409,186074,5,"""This isn't just a good book. This is THE Book. One to remember long after you read it. One to consume slowly and cherish the taste. One to reread with delight. A masterpiece not only of genre, but of writing as such. 
 As I don't want to sound more pompous than I already do, lets just say, that the story is catching, the characters realistic and magical at the same time, and the world feels manifold with deep history, wide geography and various cultures. But what I find most fascinating is plenty of inner stories, legends and songs. This said, I can't stop myself from comparing Rothfuss with Tolkien, and as a great fan of the latter, I am surprised to find their creation equally enchanting. 
 Poetic but not sugary, voluble but not stodgy, The Name of the Wind left me starving for more, with three kinds of silence inside and around me.""",2012-09-05 11:39:28,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
410,17449965,4,"""I absolutely love that cover. It's stunning and really reminds me of Eve, from Adam and Eve - which I suspect is exactly what it is. The rosy red of the apple has never looked so tempting and taking a bite? Ohh honey, such the wrong thing to do, but staying away, you just can't. You have to take a bite. It's too tempting. 
 That is exactly what Great Exploitations is about. Tempting the married man to have a one-night stand to ensure that the pre-nup they made their wives have, is now null due to the Infidelity clause. Not only do the wives get a share of the money, so does the Eve and the business. 
 Great Exploitations is the first in a novella series. The main character goes by Sienna in this book. She is a Eve - a member of a secret elite of beautiful woman hired by unhappy wives of cheating, rich men to seduce and sleep with the husbands who have made them sign a prenup. If they divorced them, they would get nothing, but catching them in the act? Well, they will get half of their husbands money due to a little thing in the prenup called The Infidelity Clause. 
 The agency is owned by 'G', who scouts for her Eves and transforms them into the seductive women they are today. G scouted Sienna five years ago, and turned her into the temptress she is today. 'Sienna' or whomever she is, is one of the top Eves. She puts a lot of effort into her job; from nitpicking every little detail about the Target, to transforming herself into his perfect woman, to making sure she has his complete and undivided attention on her so she can get the job done. 
 She's good at her job and that's how she wants to keep it. Sienna seems to have no emotions attached to her. She treats sex as sex. No feelings before or after. It's like shes a robot. Programmed to do the steps to hook line and sink the Target. To make sure they are caught and the wives get the money that they deserve when they are shown the pictures the P.I's take of her and the target. 
 The men are tagged by how much money they are worth by the number of zeros in their bank account. Eights and Nines are pretty great but a Ten? That is rare but if one does come around, it's a complete goldmine. A Ten for Sienna would give her the freedom she is looking for and it would set her up for life having all that money in her account. 
 It's a short book, at only 90 pages but there is so much information packed into it. Nicole Williams takes you through a journey about who the Eves are, what they do and how hard they work to make sure their job is done and dusted to perfection. There is a lot of hard work put into being an Eve. 
 It is a quick read, but one I thoroughly enjoyed. It was brilliantly written, and the concept was such an interesting one to read. You won't want to put it down and from that ending? The rare Ten? Oh I cannot wait to read the next novel in the series. It really leaves you wanting more and wanting to know all about Sienna's past and her ever-growing closeness to her freedom...whatever her freedom really is.""",2013-02-28 02:40:44,"Mischief in Miami (Great Exploitations, #1)",romance;fiction,Nicole  Williams

412,9752790,2,"""This book hinges on the edge of 2 and 3 stars...so okay, 2.5, and if someone asks me how I liked the series, I'll say that it was just ""okay."" 
 I should have known from the cover that this book wasn't going to end well... But I had hope, I did. I've read enough dystopian/post-apocolyptic series and books to know that people have to die in the end. But for me, I felt this book didn't have any closure. At the end of the 2nd book, I hoped that Pressia and the others would be able to return with their findings and items and build something better. Alas. 
 [POSSIBLE SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.] 
 Sigh. What do I even say? This book did not end well for me. There are so many unanswered questions. Mainly, what happens to everyone in the end? Pressia didn't accomplish her goal: to use to vial and formula to cure to the survivors, those outside the Dome. She found her grandfather, and the burning question I'm sure we all wanted to know was Is her father still alive? In the end, it seems like he still was but ... like I said, there's no closure. I believe it was Arvin Weed who told Pressia that she had something inside of her that could change things and make things work. At first I thought he was talking physically, but I think now it's more emotional and even spiritual. Of all the people, Pressia has held on to hope more than the rest. 
 Now that I'm done reading the trilogy, I can say for sure that Partridge is a coward, and his characters flaws completely outweigh anything that was good in him. He can't escape his father, even after he's dead. He was never in control of anything, and like the very beginning, he was a pawn, he still is towards the end--the favor Iralene asked of him, he kept it, and held back, he didn't do anything--so in my book, he's a coward. I can't bring myself to like him. 
 Lyda, I think, is the one who has made the most change. Once back in the Dome, she realizes she can't go back, can't pretend that things will work with Partridge, and so in the end, she chooses to leave with Pressia and the others. 
 It's interesting that someone pointed out that the Pures would surely all die outside the dome, while the wretches are the strong ones, the ones who have survived through the Detonations. Willux's logic confused me. He wanted to make a superior race but he couldn't see the superior race that was right outside the Dome. He made the mess. Ughhhhh. 
 Anyways, this was an interesting series to read. It's different than most dystopian novels that I've read but like I've stated before, no closure--it didn't end clean. I feel Baggott should/could right another book in the series to help her audience deal with the ending.""",2015-06-10 20:13:59,"Burn (Pure, #3)",young-adult;fiction;fantasy;paranormal;romance,Julianna Baggott
413,147842,4,"""I just can't get over how amazing this series is! One of the best fantasy novels I've read in a long time. Britain has such a way with words that the descriptions are beautiful, characters relatively easy to relate to, and the plot just keeps you reading! 
 [POSSIBLE SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.] 
 First off, I must say this, I'm still pining that Karigan and King Zachary could somehow be together. I know it sound so silly, especially since both parties know it isn't possible, and that Zachary is to marry Lady Estora (which I'm not opposed to, and grew to like in this book) but...a girl can wish, can't she? Karigan certainly seems to. 
 I think Karigan and Lady Estora provide as a good opposites of each other. Both want something the other one has and when Estora get kidnapped, I think she and Karigan both realize maybe they are better suited for the roles they already have, instead of the ones they want from each other. 
 I admit, though, that even though what's happening at the wall is a big part of the book, I just wanted to skim all of that. I can't get myself to like Alton again, after the first book. I don't want him as a love interest for Karigan but I guess his depression and general angry sort of went through the pages and into me to make me not like him that much, lol. I was, however, interesting in the Riders who went THROUGH the wall because of all that happened with the mages. Britain did a fantastic job telling the history because not only was it new for the audience, but also the characters hearing it for the first time (Dale & Garth). 
 The last 75 pages or so of the book really held me down though. It'll be interesting to see how Karigan's role as an avatar plays out--like she's somewhat of a mouthpiece of the gods. Karigan's title as 
 Knight will also be interesting, and I wonder if this means she'll have a bigger role to play with the king (STILL HOPING).

 On her way home from school, Karigan G'ladheon comes across a half-dead man, black arrows protruding from his back. He beckons her, telling her she must get the message to King Zachary at all costs. Afraid but slightly curious, Karigan accepts his mission and it throws her into a world that she's only heard or read about in books. In her journey to Sacor City to reach the king, Karigan comes across a lot more than she bargained for. She meets good and bad. 
 In all honesty, I really couldn't put the book down. I was engrossed and the book played out like a movie perfectly in my head. A lot of times I wonder if I could have ever done what the main character did, lol. The way Britain portrays magic is different than what I've read in other fantasy novels and I like that. 
 However, I did think the story dragged on for a while, but just when you thought the story was over, there's just a bit more to keep you going. I like that. 
 Also, am I the only one who is slightly rooting for Karigan and the king? That probably sounds so absurd.

 This one was cute for sure, but not as addicting as I had hoped. 
 Claire was a little over-dramatic and I hate to say that because she does have a sad past that does warrant her reactions. There was a lot of potential there but it kind-of fell flat by her irrational actions. I just didn't warm up to her as much as I had hoped. 
 I thought Jake had the best character growth. A lot of that is thanks to Claire and her ability to see him as a person and not a commodity. And in turn, he helps her with her self-confidence. I really enjoyed that aspect of their relationship. I like when romances aid in personal character growth. 
 This was more of a slow burn romance than I anticipated. And for the longest time, I didn't see how these two would ever fall for each other. They were constantly at each other's throats. It takes them a while to reach the point that is described in the synopsis. 
 Overall: it's cute and it was enjoyable but nothing new to me.

416,186074,5,"""I loved this. It was complex and long and detailed and most importantly, I really cared about finding out what happened (and I didn't care when the book ended without us finding out, since Kvothe/Rothfuss was clever enough to wrap up several other intriguing plot points). The genre-savvy-ness of it has me giggling or hooting with laughter at least once per chapter. The device of the main character telling his own story was handled expertly, the magic was well thought out but not overly complicated, Kvothe seems overly powerful and awesome at first, but he is a deeply flawed human being who gets himself into an amazing amount of trouble. Sometimes the plot ran a little too hard on him, to the point that I wanted to look away and stop reading several times, but he always manages to lift himself out again. 
 But. 
 There's always a but. 
 Why? Because despite it's excellence, despite its snappy writing, in so many ways it's just like every other fantasy novel out there. Everything's different here in Fantasyland! The language, the history, the geography, the mythology, even the currency! But don't despair, you'll be comforted by some passing similarities to our own world - men are still in charge, everyone is white, all the women are daughters/wives/mothers or whores/flirts/healers/victims, and the villages/clothing/architecture are all European-style. I mean, there's even a classic scene in which a woman is in the room for no other purpose than to be assaulted by one man and saved by another. She never says a word. She's just there. 
 Why? 
 Who looks around our world in which women are treated like shit, where they were once treated like less than shit (and in many places/situations still are), and goes, ""In my escapist fantasy novel, I'll change everything! But not that.""? 
 To be fair, Rothfuss does better than 90% of Fantasyland, especially in the second half (the review I was writing in my head after the first half was decidedly more scathing). Women start to pop out of the woodwork, and two of them even manage to avoid victim/whore/healer status. Denna, Devi, Fela, Auri, Mola - I really liked all of them. They were smart and interesting and strong...but it almost wasn't enough. They almost all had to be female, according to The Rules - the Lover, the Token Co-ed, the Ethereal One, the Healer. Devi...Devi works. But the characters default to male, except when being female makes things more interesting. 
 Why isn't the Chronicler female? Why isn't Bast female?* Why aren't any of Kvothe's university buddies female? Why aren't any of the regulars at the Waystone female? Why aren't either or both of the owners of the Eolian female? Why are women outnumbered ten to one at the university? Because it's easy. It's easy to just write things ""as they are"" when it comes to women. 
 It just makes it harder for me to escape. 
 God, you'd think I hated it based on what I wrote. I loved it. I loved it like cheesecake, a perfect piece of cheesecake, flavored exotically with key lime and almond. But woman cannot live on cheesecake alone...

 Made the mistake of watching the movie before I had gotten very far in the book. I loved the setting and the idea of this story: a young girl comes to America from Ireland and ends up getting caught between two worlds -- and two men. But the actual details of the story and characters were not so interesting to me. 
 I think to be honest I enjoyed the movie more. Movie Tony is more adorable, book Tony seems more selfish. And while I didn't like one particular plot point, I did think it was handled better in the book. The main character is indecisive and lets things happen to her, which was more clear and also more annoying in the book.

421,8683812,4,"""Hadley and Ernest Hemingway gave each other silly nicknames, lived in Paris surrounded by Important Artists, and had a marriage that collapsed in about five years. Despite the facts of history and the foreshadowing at the front of the book, I still hoped that somehow things would turn out better. 
 The book presents several factors that might have contributed to the marriage failing: Ernest putting his craft above all else, breaches of trust like Hadley losing his manuscripts on a train, the war changing things people once viewed as sacred and permanent, the influence of the couple's bohemian friends with their complicated love lives, etc. At one point it's explained how Hemingway burned his bridges with friends who had been important mentors, and the idea is that he had to cut ties with them almost to prove to himself that he hadn't needed their help to succeed. Perhaps that's what happened with Hadley also. He really did seem to need and love her at first... until he finished The Sun Also Rises. (To his credit, he did at least give her the royalties from it.) 
 It was interesting to see how at the beginning of their marriage, Hadley and Ernest couldn't imagine how the other couples they knew could function the way they did, with open relationships and love triangles and the like. People seemed to view the Hemingways as set apart and above it all, like they were the model of love and if they couldn't make it, no one could. By the end of the book, though, they've turned into the couple with the relationship their newly married friends view with shock and disbelief. 
 The book is mostly written from Hadley's perspective, but there are occasional breaks of short sections written more from Hemingway's point of view. I found these quite powerful and effective. While the pair had decided to be honest and straightforward with each other, the Ernest sections make Hadley's seem meandering. They are raw, real, vibrant, dark, and very briefly manage to explain a lot about just what might have been going on in that man's head. 
 I've read some Hemingway in the past, but it's been a while, and what's stuck in my mind is more the feeling of his writing than the substance of it. There was a list I read once of famous people's made up answers to the question, ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" The Hemingway answer: ""To die. In the rain."" That pretty much sums him up for me. While he seems like kind of a jerk in the book (especially by the end), I think the author did a good job of capturing all that was compelling and exciting and attractive about him as well. I could see why Hadley fell for him as well as what he was drawn to in her.

430,186074,4,"""The proof the Rothfuss is a brilliant writer is shown in the fact that, despite my small qualms with this book - I found the frame kind of dull, Kvothe slightly too perfect in many respects, and Denna quite annoying - I absolutely loved it. Kvothe's perfection - bordering on Mary-Sue proportions - is what makes his story so damn interesting and completely unputdownable.""",2013-06-28 06:25:11,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
431,186074,4,"""This is a common review for The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear, the first two books that comprise The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss. While they have been published as two separate books, they are in reality two installments of the same unfinished story, the third installment of which is now being written. Unlike Mistborn and Harry Potter the books do not stand on their own. 
 The two installments are unequal in more respects than mere size. They are estimated (by fantasy-faction.com) to be around 260,000 and 399,000 words long. Over 650k words so far and the story is far from finished. We live in the age of million-word stories. 
 The two installments are unequal in terms of impact too. The first one - at least the first half of the first one - was stunning. The kind of writing that makes even the cynical sit up and take notice. The second pales in comparison. 
 Patrick Rothfuss is one of the better fantasy authors I have read recently. Very good writing that reads like a true epic. The author takes the time and the pages to tell a story well, and without too many modern colloquialisms. This is the kind of writing that one reads for the prose alone. Those who like nuanced prose and like fantasy will find this a truly great read. 
 Those who primarily look for a plot may want to wait for the third (and final?) installment to be published so that they can read the entire plot. 1,600 pages down, the plot remains unclear. 
 The main character (Kvothe) is strong. Very strong. The entire 1,600 pages have been about him. Some would find him tiring. I liked some of the supporting characters - Elodin, Puppet, Auri, Kvothe's parents and as couple of Masters. 
 The story itself is interesting, but I wish the author had taken fewer pages to tell it. It is truly compelling in the first book. The world is diverse and the magic system(s) varied and deep. It has its weak parts too - the romance is a little off, Kvothe's stay at the University stretches, and the Ambrose angle reminds me too much of Draco Malfoy's antics. Childish and dark. 
 For those who care about such things, the books don't have story arcs of their own that finish when a book ends. Each is but an installment of a long story that could be chopped anywhere into two. But when I finished the first book, I deferred other reading plans and picked up the second book. 
 Rating: I give the first book 4 stars for the stunning debut and setup. Had little more happened in the second half of the book, or if the book had ended well, I would have given it 5 stars. The second book gets between 2 & 3 stars. The story meanders with more of the same. The events are less credible, and the space between them takes far too many pages. But the writing is still excellent. Overall, both books combined, it gets 3 stars. 
 Summary: Read it for the prose - its lovely. But if you are a plot person, be aware that the plot meanders, and doesn't come to logical points when the books end.""",2013-01-11 22:44:59,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

The sudden disappearance and tragic end were amazingly well written. 
 As far as the vampires and zombies are concerned, I suppose they were revolutionary when the book was written, but are quite stale now. Overall, an ok read but halfway through, I read on simply because I wanted to finish the book, not because I was enjoying the read.

Then my buddy Steve read the original Matheson tale and let me know that the book was significantly different from the movie, and well worth the read. When I found out the eBook was available from my library, I really didn't have any other excuses. 
 The story presents an excellent perspective on the concept of the last man. How long would your sanity hold if you knew you were utterly alone, and that every day the world was trying to kill you? How long would you persevere, and how could you maintain hope? This story is much less about the vampire and much more about the human.

441,18880307,2,"""I'm conflicted about this story. I think it does have a lot of potential, but I wasn't impressed with how the characters were developed. It felt like the author sat down and tried to come up with every possible bad thing that could happen to a girl in order to make the reader sympathetic towards Jenna. It backfired, because it's just not believable. There's a definite moment where Jenna becomes 2 different characters. I wasn't a fan of her in the 2nd half of the book. I thought she was immature and was acting out viciously 24/7. Kidd felt pretty two dimensional to me, so I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat to see how their romance would play out. I had a pretty ""meh"" attitude about it. 
 The thing about MC romance is that I think there's a whole lot of potential for more conflict that exists outside of the romance and it would kick the novel's complexity up a notch. So many subplots can form from a gang setting. Some authors take on the challenge, but many don't.

I'm sorry but having maybe one love triangle is fine but Reed seems to have to do battle with everyone except Zephyr over her - Russell, Brennus, Xavier et all. And all Evie does is lead them on and then boohoo about how confused she is. It's too much for me! 
 What is also too much for me is that the author will write whole chapters in Russell's or Brennus' accent. In my opinion, once you've informed the reader of the way a character speaks, there really is no need to go so overboard and bombard people with it to be honest. I do not need to read entire chapters like ""I bring me hand ta da bridge of me nose, pinching it in an attempt ta ease da ache dere."" Just make it clear that Brennus is Irish and then carry on writing in proper English! 
 Now onto the points I do like... Yet again, the cover is beautiful. Like, seriously one of the prettiest book covers I've seen. Bravo. 
 Zephyr - well he's just awesome. 
 When the story is being written in proper English, I think it's actually pretty good and enjoyed it. If only the whole thing could have been written that way. 
 Overall, I give it a solid 3.5*

 I was sad to see this story end. This was a fast paced book with enough drama to keep it interesting. There were some very steamy scenes!!! It was also an interesting sexual preference, which I appreciated because everything seems to about bdsm lately. This book was not that. The ""rules"" to their sexual practices almost seemed to push the boundaries. There was no cheating, but I wondered a few times where the line was drawn, and I think the characters questioned this at times too. I think Julia actually gets the better end of the deal, as Brad's preferences are more driven by competition and his need to please his woman, rather than any need to be with multiple women. Julia is enough for him, so she gets to benefit from his needs rather than having to worry that Brad needing other women to be fully satisfied. I love the confidence and trust that Brad and Julia have in their relationship. 
 I didn't give it 5 stars because I wanted it to be longer. I wanted the story with Brad's family to be a bit more fleshed out. As the final book, I wanted to more of a complete ending, and even with the bonus chapter, I still had a few questions. I actually think the bonus chapter should be part of the epilogue. Overall though, I really loved this series, and most of all, I loved being introduced to Alessandra Torre through this series about a year ago.

455,38568,3,"""Review from Backchatting Books 
 How do you help your 200 year old immortal daughter with hemaphobia? You kidnap a psychologist that specialises in phobias, of course. Not only does Lissianna's mother Marguerite do that, she ties Dr Greg Hewitt to Lissianna's bed and wraps a red ribbon around his neck, because you know packaging is everything. Lissianna however thinks he is dinner and has a quick bite - hence the name of the book - before the family intervenes. 
 I'm going to talk about the world building initially rather than the characters as I think the concept was pretty unique. Vampires actually originated from the technologically advanced, ancient Atlantis. They combined nanotechnology with bioengineering. These nanos which live inside their bodies require blood to keep the vampires in optimum condition. Vampires aren't allergic to the sun but it does mean the nanos have to work a bit harder to repair them and need more blood. It kept sparking memories of the epic science fiction show Red Dwarf which featured recalcitrant nanos. 
 Fearful of discovery, vampires no longer feed ""off the hoof"" but instead use blood banks to survive. Lissianna however is hemophobic which means she needs to either be fed blood intravenously or find victims she can feed off directly. Lissianna tries to combine her interest in social work with finding food and so works at a local shelter. She is affected by the blood she drinks so consuming the blood of a drunk or ill person affects her negatively. While the interactions between Lissianna and Greg were fun, they were not really deep and meaningful. I thought that Greg was far too calm and rational when he found out that vampires were real and got on the 'vampires are cool' bandwagon way too fast. For a psychologist he is fairly shallow - when he's tied to a bed in a strange house with a bladder that is about to burst he thinks that it would be great to be a sex slave for someone like Lissianna. Come on. Despite this, I loved the fact that life mates were unable to read each other's minds or control each other. This offered the chance for a true partnership rather than having one dominate over the other. 
 The secondary characters, or should I say cast of thousands were really distracting. Even with the best will in the world, I couldn't differentiate between the HEA fodder. Introducing all of them at once seemed a bit of a clumsy move even though I can understand that some characters were needed to assure Greg that Lissianna was sweet and really needed his help. The interactions between the secondary characters lacked some maturity. A pyjama for people over the age of 200 just seemed bizarre and for no purpose other than to allow the females to strut around in their rainbow of baby-doll lingerie. The villain of the piece was no better constructed as he basically had a neon sign pointing to him, yet Lissianna and the others were completely flummoxed. 
 This book is fun even though plot is uncomplicated and the outcome predictable. It is light, cheesy and delicious in small quantities.""",2012-12-22 14:28:53,A Quick Bite (Argeneau #1),fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Lynsay Sands

The thing is, for me Alison's heroes take a little getting used to. I never fall in love with them in my first read; well, except for Nash from Foolish Expectations. With him I fell in love at my first read. Coming back to On the Plus Side, I knew since I read Size Matters, that I would love Valerie and her story. 
 Valerie Carmichael is a lot of things I am not. She is confident in her sex appeal, happy with her body and knows that men drool over her. She is not hurting for anything. The only thing she does not have is her brother's best friend and her childhood crush, Logan Mathis. 
 Logan is back in the small town he fled from years ago. He just opened a new bar to help save his mother's home from getting foreclosed. He is determined to earn as much money as possible and as soon as possible. He doesn't have any time for a sexy distraction like his best friend's sister, Valerie. 
 Logan is the only man who has resisted Valerie. Valerie is the only woman Logan is tempted to have. This guaranteed a super-fun read, and Ms. Bliss did not disappoint. 
 On the Plus Side was undoubtedly an entertaining, fun and hot read. I loved how Valerie's ""Never-to-do-list"" turned into an ""Holy-hell-why-did-I-not-want-to-do-it-list"". This was one of the best parts of this book. While I loved Logan as an individual, as a friend and a son, sometimes the way her treated Valerie just grated on my nerves. But he is just human after all. Valerie also made some stupid decisions that hurt Logan badly. Her reason for what she did was just plain childish, but again, she is human. 
 The one character who highly irritated me though was Valerie's brother. He was an over-protective brother.. like way too over-protective. He behaved like Valerie was a 5-year-old kid rather than a 20 something woman. On the other hand, I loved seeing Sam and Leah. There is so much change that you can see in Leah since Size Matters. She has become a lot more confident and accepting of herself. 
 Overall, the book was really good. I'm eager to read Max's story though. I am hoping his girl gives him a lot of hell for all the mischief he causes.""",2016-12-10 05:23:19,On the Plus Side (A Perfect Fit #2),romance;fiction,Alison Bliss

 So, the 4th Tear Asunder book. 
 Wow, it feels like forever since I met Sculpt, and fell in love with him. 
 So here's a fun fact: Torn From You was the first Dark Romance book I read some 3-4 years ago, and it was the book that made me fall in love with the genre. And because of that, I will forever be grateful to Rose. 
 Kite, from the very first book had been an enigma- the quiet bandmate, everyone respected, but at the same time so different from the rest. 
 To say that I have been curious about him would be an understatement. 
 I have always wanted to know more about him, and it isn't even until the end of the 3rd book, in Shattered By You, that we even come to know of his name. 
 Killian Kane. 
 He was every bit the man I expected him to be. 
 Tormented, possessive and true to his words. 
 When he was 16 he met Savvy, and from the very first time, something about her called to him. But because both of them were very young and because Savvy had just lost her mother, he let's her go with the warning that next time he meets her, he won't. 
 Cue 11 years into the future. 
 Savvy is a dancer, but she has no where to work. Desperate for some sort of job, she goes to the boy she loved as a child to ask for some job recommendation. 
 I have to say, I really liked Savvy. She was so different from Rose's other female characters from the series, that she was in some ways, a real breath of fresh air. 
 She was a complete wildcard, and I kind of kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. Well, I was glad that it did not. Sometimes an uncomplicated character is the best thing you can do to the story. For me, she perfectly complimented Killian. 
 He was very complicated. As a child, he had been really abused by his father, and the loss of his mother and brother fucked him up. 
 I was a bit frustrated with the way Rose tried to portray his character though. So he's this lady killer, and is into the hardcore stuff.. but he's also a virgin? Yeah I found that a little too hard to believe. He was waiting for Savvy to come back? Really? Yeah that part was the thing I'm not buying. Either he's a kinky motherfucker, or he's a virgin- decide. You can't tell me he's a sex god on his first try. I feel like if I complain about that for the ladies, I should complain about the men too. He's nearly 28, and he's never had sex.. but he's also into hardcore BDSM, and has skills of a seasoned pro. Try and make sense of that. 
 Other than that little twist Rose tried to throw at us, I really liked it. 
 Although staying true to it's genre, it does deal with certain dark themes, Kept From You is a lot lighter compared to it's predecessors. It is the perfect conclusion to this brilliant series.""",2016-10-29 10:33:15,"Kept from You (Tear Asunder, #4)",romance,Nashoda Rose

 Patrick Rothfuss' writing is like nothing else I've ever read. Each sentence feels so carefully and lovingly crafted, it makes me despair of ever writing anything as poetic and wonderful. I've probably read it four or five times, and I never get tired of it. I still tear up in the same places, even though I know what's going to happen.

 I wasn't very impressed by Beth's Across the Universe trilogy so I was a little apprehensive about reading this, but The Body Electric sure as hell surprised me. In a fantastic way. 
 The setting 
 Like her previous trilogy, this is a futuristic story set in the 24th century. Normally, you wouldn't expect a standalone sci-fi novel to incorporate a solid background in, and this book wasn't an exception, but I like how Beth dedicated a short appendix to explain all the wars and stuff. Most importantly, everything in the book made sense. Most of the time, sci-fi stories focus on the use of technology by the government and hardly talk about the marketable aspect of it, so major props for the reverie business Ella's mum set up. People still need to eat after all. 
 The plot 
 In the first 10% of the book, when the PA (who practically singlehandedly stopped the Secessionary War 20 years ago) requests to meet Ella personally and all that jazz, it seemed like the special snowflake syndrome all over again and I was like 
 Though she's the daughter of two famous scientists, you don't exactly see Obama inviting seventeen year kids into the White House on an everyday basis. But in the end, it all adds up, so keep those judgy faces away for a bit. The rest is worth it. 
 Ella 
 Can I just give her a hell yeah? HELL YEAH. This girl knows what's going on. She may not know whether to trust those around her, but she never doubts herself. You don't have to be smart or sassy or whatever to be a strong heroine, you just need to know what you want and what you don't want. And she sure as heck does. 
 Plus when she first meets Jack the cutie in the graveyard and he acts all creepy and grabs her, she doesn't dig that weakass melt-into-a-puddle-of-goo shit, but instead punches him right in the face and keeps her finger on the panic button of her cufflink to call the police in case the dude turns dangerous. 
 When she's introduced to the ragtag rebel group, she demands answers and purposefully tries to force a confession out of them. In other books, you have that dumb girl believing everything the rebels say and betraying her whole family just to join the half-assed cause in two seconds. Not Ella. She fights for what she believes is true as well as for her mum to just survive another day. 
 I don't usually reread plot-driven books so I probably won't be rereading this, but I don't think I'll ever forget The Body Electric any time soon. 
 Highly recommended.""",2014-08-29 05:28:33,The Body Electric,young-adult;fiction;romance;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Beth Revis
462,186074,5,"""I usually fight giving anything a 5-star review, but this book truly deserved it. The typical good-vs-evil orphan-rising-to-become-savior fantasy story is getting a little tired point, but Rothfuss found a way to make it exciting and fun. I've heard this book called the beginning of a Harry-Potter-for-adults series, and the comparison does fit, but it brings so much of its own to the table that you soon overlook its similarities to anything else. 
 The characters I would have to rate highly. The hero and his school friends/enemies all are very strong and work dynamically off of each other. I do think we could have done with getting *to* the actual school a little earlier and saved quite a bit of length off of the book. The one character that raises my eyebrow is Denna; she runs so hot-and-cold that you eventually just give up trying to figure her out. 
 The main story of the book is framed by a side-story of it being dictated by the hero to a character named ""Chronicler"". It feels like once the backstory has been finished in future books it will then continue from the ""present"" timeline that Chronicler is writing from. The side-story also serves as a device to avoid following the typical hero's journey. For example: when someone he knows is accused of heresy and arrested by the church (at this point you expect some form of heroic rescue because pretty much any other fantasy book with this plot would do that,) the hero just shrugs it off and does nothing, dismissing it as ""this is my story, not his. Besides, he said he had friends who could help him from the inside."" After several scenes like that, you begin to wonder just how much artistic license is being taken or just how much is being left out by the hero, who confesses to enjoy ""telling stories"".

They were Chanel, black-textured with a peep toe and a gold zipper up the back, really more of a booty than a stiletto. And not what you'd ever call ""Fuck me"" shoes-there was nothing about them that would make a guy want to bed you, unless he was the type who liked a razor-sharp heel at his throat.""Finally getting around to writing some reviews for books I read earlier this year, as you can see I read this back in June. Better late than never, right? 
 When I first read the synopsis I was definitely intrigued. But my first thoughts were, ""Wait. Kate White? Doesn't she write those self-help kind of books?"" Close but no. I had no idea that she wrote a variety of different books until I came across Eyes On You on Edelweiss. Once I started reading I just didn't want to put the book down! You know the board game Clue? Well I felt like my Clue senses were tingling! I kept trying to figure out who was after Robin. I was torn between two characters at around 35% but then by 70% I knew for sure who it was but that didn't deteriorate me. 
 What kept Eyes On You from getting 5 stars? 
 At times I found myself I little confused with Robin's narration. At certain points I couldn't tell if she was making a statement or questioning something, which often had me going back a page and re-reading trying to figuring it out. But I've chalked this all up to the fact that it's an advanced ebook copy and there will most likely be changes by time it was published. 
 Overall, Eyes On You was a great mysterious read that kept me on my toes. I was so eager to get to the end, even when I guessed who the culprit was. I look forward to read more by Kate White, I noticed that she has two books coming out next year.

 I wasn't expecting a vampire story to be honest, mostly because I've watched the movie first and both turned out to be completely different. But I really liked how the author ""reinvented"" the myth of the vampire by giving it a scientific explanation. The writing was really easy to get into, and the story was really plausible. Even though I felt a little more connected to the main character in the movie, Robert Neville felt much more human and his reactions were honest. I never got bored, even though we only follow one character. 
 Also, I loved the contrast between the film and the book. Most of the time when I watch a movie adaptation I want it to follow exactly what's going on in the book, but in this case what I liked the most was all the differences between the two of them. And while the ending of the movie (+ the meaning of the title) seems to be more optimistic for the future, it's not the same at all in the book...

She takes up at a boarding house run by an older Irish woman, starts a new job secured by Father Flood, and eventually begins evening classes. We follow Eilis as she navigates a strange city, battles extreme homesickness, learns the ropes of her new job, and eventually falls in love. In the hands of anyone else, the subject matter may be downright dull. But Toibin's writing is something special- no lofty exaltation or sappy emotional breakdowns, but acute observations of the life of one very practical main character. So when tragedy strikes and Eilis's new world is turned upside down, we as readers are turned upside down with her. The sparse and precise writing in itself gives us a portrait of Eilis and her reactions that no verbose descriptions could. 
  Having said all this, Brooklyn would have been a five star review for me easily if it had not been for the last 40 or so pages. After showing so much growth and so much strength at adversity emerge in Eilis, Toibin spends those last pages telling us that a young woman who dares to branch out, to be bold, to fall in love, will surely come to regret it. I'd love to speak to the author about whether or not that was the intended implication of Eilis's regret at marrying Tony, but it was certainly my takeaway. Eilis's quick involvement with Jim also shifted our main character from pragmatic and strong to indecisive and prone to infatuation.

 Despite having a degree in English and having always been a fan of classic modern literature, I have never been a fan of Hemingway. His literature- in my personal opinion- seethes with misogyny and insecurity (neither one excusing the other). 
 In McLain's fictional account of Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley Richardson, a new voice- one easily forgotten by history- is brought to light. The following of Hadley sheds new light on Hemingway's own struggles and anxieties, but more than that, it flushes out the character of a woman burdened by her own family history and fighting to save love. The author writes in her afterward that she began to fall for young Hemingway when researching the book. I felt just the opposite. Though I sympathized with his difficulties in trying to maintain the ever tenuous feeling of ""being alive,"" his selfishness overwhelmed me. And I developed a deep feeling and worry fro Hadley. Her experiences and reactions to those experiences expressed my own deep fears about how easily one can be lost in the needs of another when in a relationship. Hadley spends much of the marriage finding her own strength and voice, and though she loves Hemingway, she learns to love herself more. 
 When I finally put this book down- sadly and with longing for more of the story- I immediately took to the internet to learn more about the real-life Hadley. After seeing photos and reading about her life after finally leaving Paris behind her, I felt even more bound to her as an inspiration. And though I did not feel about the famed author as McLain did, I could feel nothing but admiration for McLain herself.

480,11309018,4,"""A collection of short stories set in the Ranger's Apprentice universe - one of my favorite series. 
 Overall comments: 
 I went in thinking the set was mostly filling in various gaps of the other stories, and there are a few stories that do that, but a lot of the stories took place after book 10, and I almost feel like Flanagan wanted to write another book but knew he'd said it was done, so went this route instead. It would be ironic if that was the case, since another book is coming out now. ^_^ 
 Like any short story collection, some are better than others. It started a bit slow, for me, but picked up with the fourth story, 'Purple Prose', and I was reminded why I love this series so much - mostly for the characters and their various interactions. 
 It was nice to see some stories that highlighted other characters - Gilan, Jenny, Alyss - though I noticed that poor George seemed to have been left out of the proceedings entirely. 
 Overall, I ended up really enjoying the set, and recommend it to any fan. 
 Individual stories: 
 Right from the start I was put into a bit of a funk because I found the foreword a little depressing. 
 Basically, the foreword opens with an archaeological dig in the future of the RA world, and they are at Castle Redmont and the find the cottage and the collection of stories that are in this book. That's the framing story. 
 But, the thing is, I like to think of the characters in books I read as sort of timeless and eternal. Sort of living forever within the worlds of their stories - kind of like in the Thursday Next books, but less depressing 'cause they're not forced to just repeat the same pages over and over again. 
 Silly, I know, and I know it's kind of gleaned in the blurb... but I was prepared for it, and it made me a bit sad. 
 And then I wasn't sure what to make of the first story, 'Death of a Hero', which was also a bit depressing and also a bit ret-conny, though that's explained in the story. (2.5) 
 'Inkwell and the Dagger' was pretty good, and I liked to see Gilan get his own story, but there was something off about it. (3) 
 And then came 'The Roamers' which, again, was pretty good but not great, and I felt that Ebony being stolen was a bit too reminiscent of Tug getting lost in one of the books, and I was also a bit uncomfortable with some of the stereotypes - though, in fairness, this series has always sort of skirted that line. I did like seeing Alyss kick some butt, though. (3) 
 But then came 'Purple Prose', which I loved. Halt and Will were front and center, and the camaraderie between the two, the humor and friendship, reminded me what I love so much about the series. (5) 
 'Dinner for Five' was good, too, and we see more of Gilan, this time pair with Jenny. (3) 
 'The Bridal Dance' was, I think, the second best story. Many friends from throughout the series are brought together for Horace and Evanlyn's wedding, and Will is also front and center with a mystery to solve. (4) 
 'The Hibernian' is a cool look into Halt and Crowley's first meeting, and the beginning of their revival of the Ranger's. (3) 
 'The Wolf' was bittersweet, and left me a bit teary-eyed. It dealt with an issue with the horses which I had been wondering about myself, and it was handled well - though I was so miffed at Will for being so careless! - but, still... (3.5) 
 Lastly, 'And About Time, Too...' was a nice ending to the set, with a lot of d'awww attached. (4) 
 Overall, I'm pleased with the collection and the happy jujubees it left me with. :>""",2011-10-03 06:11:19,"The Lost Stories (Ranger's Apprentice, #11)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;children;romance,John Flanagan

 The pacing was a bit slow, and it was definitely not one where I couldn't wait to get back into it. I did like Shandy and Davies and Skank. I think my favorite part was watching Shandy turn into a pirate and accept his role, and to find that they were, despite their wicked ways, actually good guys. Honor amongst thieves and all that.

Totally un-put-down-able, Left Drowning is an exceptional love story full of very messed up, but completely beautiful people. Blythe is the girl with issues at the start - barely surviving after a tragedy that broke her world apart, when a chance meeting drives her to start living again. 
 Sabin is the first of the Shepherds that Blythe meets. Sabin is theatre guy - outrageous and crazy and full of life, dropping into Blythe's world and waking her up more than the coffee he stole ever could. Christopher comes next - grounding Blythe right from the start more than he knows. Estelle & Eric soon follow, each worming their way into her life in their own inimitable way. Chris may be the one she lusts after, but all of the Shepherds play their own part in bringing Blythe back to life, and I love that. 
 So, Christopher Shepherd. Wow. Be warned - this book is seriously sexy in parts. Chris does things to Blythe that made me want to swoon. Things may not always be plain sailing with these two - in fact their relationship is questionable at the best of times - but when they do get it on, they are hot! 
 The Shepherds offered Blythe family when she needed it most, but we mustn't overlook her own family, small as it is. If we cast aside the cold-fish aunt, we're left with James, Blythe's younger brother. He doesn't have a huge part to play lines-wise, but he does feature heavily in Blythe's past map of guilt and distress. He is an important character, and he is a sweetie. I'd rather like to hear his story, is if you're looking for inspiration, Ms Parks, how about giving James a voice? 
 One of the things Blythe doesn't realise, as they put her back together, is the full extent of the Shepherds' own painful tangle of issues. They do so well at hiding it, always looking forward, never casting an eye back to the past. Bit it's there alright, and you can't choose to ignore the past forever. At some point you're going to have to face up to it and deal with it. Can Blythe help the Shepherds' in the way that they helped her? 
 One of the things I especially loved was the way Parks intertwined the fates of these two lovers. She does it so gently that we don't even realise it at first, and neither do they. Little by little though, more is revealed, and you realise that there is more to this story than meets the eye. This involvement of fate rises Left Drowning way above the tide of NA that is currently flooding our shelves. Because this is more than just another NA book. This is one that you don't want to put down ever. I want the characters to be my best friends forever.

484,59980,4,"""Batman: Year One is so much more than the four arc comics series collected within. Yes, it is kind of thrilling to see Batman before he was so invulnerable. Yes, the story of Lieutenant Gordan's move to Gotham and his fight to be a good cop in a bad city is excellently done. And yes, the way that this particular arc has no Big Bad but the city of Gotham itself - drawn to darkly corrupt perfection - is a terrific way to pare Batman down to who he is without the rogue's gallery of super villain foes. But the greatest thing about Batman: Year One is the inclusion of all the extras once the comic is finished. 
 The line drawings and essay from artist David Mazzucchelli (including his insightful take on the why the Batman/Robin dynamic is not homerotic), the back page poetic reminiscences of Frank Miller on his first entrance into Gotham as a boy, and the recreation of how a lot of the panels originally looked in the newsprint comic palate are all fantastic inclusions, and worth the read entirely on their merits alone. It's a little behind the scenes tour of Batman's recent history, and its a perfect capstone to this carefully respectful update to the Year One mythology. 
 As for the comic itself, because Batman at this point in the story is still a work in progress - still a creation that has yet to be fully formed - a lot of this story falls to Bruce Wayne. This is interesting, because of course as Batman's story goes on, Batman becomes so much more his identity, and Bruce Wayne turns into nothing but a convenient disguise. The features of Bruce Wayne are also drawn here to be a bit blocky, a bit blank. That's a nice touch. 
 We also get glimpses of those who become important to the story later on, especially Harvey Dent and Selina Kyle (with a tongue in cheek Vicki Vale mention thrown in for good measure). While I love what this version does with the both Gordon and Dent (still, in these early days, unscarred and heroic), I was not so much a fan of the Selina Kyle bits. I understand that they are making the case that if it hadn't been for Batman, Catwoman as we know her would have also ceased to exist, but unfortunately in this story, she doesn't have much to do. I do, however, think that Frank Miller did a great job with the other female characters. Barbara Gordon (the wife, not the daughter destined to be Batgirl and Oracle) is especially well done, and the relationship between her and Jim Gordon is rendered more convincingly than most marriages in literature. I also loved the way Mazzucchelli deliberately draws certain panels to resemble Zorro, in a nod to ""The Mask of Zorro"" being the movie the Waynes were watching together immediately before Bruce's parents were killed. 
 This is a good looking version of a fine rewrite of a classic story.

 Noah's recollections of growing up during and after apartheid are bracing and thought-provoking, but also funny and infinitely readable. Especially in the UK, comedy can be the preserve of the privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate, so it was refreshing to read a comic memoir from someone who's actually Lived A Life. 
 My criticisms of Born a Crime are basically the same as everyone else's: the timeline jumps around in a way that's confusing, and too many of the stories have the feeling of standup bits, hitting the big laugh and then ending abruptly. I also could have done with a mite more about Noah's post-18 life. Late in the memoir, when Noah is an adult, he pays for his mother's hospital treatment, and my reaction was, wait he's rich now? how/when did he get rich? Lil bit confusing.

 This was a certain 4 star book until the end. I was even toying with the idea of 4.5 because I really liked the world, the characters and, of course, the feminism. Unfortunately, this novel's beautiful story was spoiled for me by its pacing. I found it quite slow getting started at the beginning and that was originally going to be my reason for a deduction. Then, bizarrely, then ending seemed really rushed to me. Literally, Leck's  death scene was a sentence. I had to reread it a few times because I thought 'What? That's it?' It came out of nowhere and then it was over before I'd even registered what was going on. I understand that it was a split second reaction and I know that Katsa reacted to it, but it all seemed so sudden to me and I didn't like that. I like detail and that isn't what I got here. Then, of course, the book didn't end there. I won't go into detail about events because I'm trying to avoid spoilers here, but when Katsa went off on her little 'quest', I was expecting about 100 more pages or so and instead I got not even 50. I loved the twist that happened at the end, that isn't at all what I'm upset about, but everything seemed to happen way too quickly and then we were left with a lot of loose ends. Again, I kind of had to sit there for a moment thinking 'Is that it?' It was an ending that left me wanting more, and not in a good way. That seems really strange to me because the amount of pages was just right, there was just too much padding at the beginning and not enough at the end. It's a shame because that spoiled things for me. 
 Other than the bizarre structure, this is a mostly good novel. It's very well written with vivid descriptions and imagery, which made me even more confused about the abrupt ending, and it's main characters were excellent. If you are a young feminist, then this is a novel that I'd recommend for you. The feminist themes throughout are very easy to spot and I enjoyed the novel in that respect. Also, the romance was absolutely beautiful. I'm very particular when it comes to romance in books, but this was exactly the kind of love story that I like. It was very subtle and Po is so respectful of Katsa's wishes. The love they shared for each other was obvious, but it developed quietly and it didn't turn into one of those melodramatic 'I can't live without you' kind of romances that appear so often in YA. I couldn't have been happier with the love story and I don't say that very often. Furthermore, I also liked Po and Katsa very much as characters. They were both very complicated and I enjoyed that. However, I found a few of the other characters to be quite two-dimensional. Bitterblue and Raffin were both OK, but I was left wanting more from both of them. The other side characters, however, were very flat. Katsa kept talking about how much she loves Oll and Helda and every time she did so, I found myself wondering why. We were told why, but we were never shown why because their characters were so underused. The 'show, don't tell' rule is one of the most important in fiction and I think that it could have been obeyed more in here. 
 The other thing about this novel that I didn't like was the other hints of romance. As I've already gushed, I loved the main romance, but two other characters also seemed to have feelings for Katsa and both of those left me feeling a little nauseous. I couldn't tell whether Raffin and Katsa were supposed to be written as friends or more than that. To me, it seemed like romantic tension between them and I was half expecting him to become her main love interest, which creeped me out a little bit because he's her cousin. Maybe that's just me and I'm misinterpreting the dynamic between them, but it bothered me a little. Also, I've noticed that failed marriage proposals or marriage proposals for the purpose of power over love are becoming more common in YA. I think this is the fifth book I've read this year which has used that plotline and that bothers me because I don't like it in most contexts. In one of those five books that I mentioned, I understood the reasoning for it and therefore didn't mind it. In another, there was a romance between the two characters so I didn't mind that either. In all of the others I've found it rather silly. It doesn't appeal to me as a plotline and I'm sick of seeing it. Please authors, if you're going to add a marriage proposal of any sort to your YA novel, make sure there's a justified reason for it. I'm becoming rather sick of reading the words 'marry me'. 
 All in all, I enjoyed this. I like the way that Cashore writes, but I'm not sure about her structuring and characterisation in some places. By far the best part of this novel was the story itself, but I also commend it for the main characters, the feminist messages and the very interesting twist at the end. I'm interested to read more from the Graceling Realm because I feel like there's a lot of room for improvement and, with an excellent storyline, I think Cashore could provide that. This world is good even if the author's execution of it isn't stellar. Therefore, I will read more in the hope of an improvement because if it does improve then I think that a book from this series has the potential to go onto my favourites shelf. Overall - decent, but disappointing.""",2013-07-25 08:44:31,"Graceling (Graceling Realm, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;romance;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Kristin Cashore
501,186074,3,"""First off, to the friend who recommended this book so highly and was so excited for me to read this: I'm so sorry. 
 (2.5) 
 The book begins as a scribe visits an inkeeper who, of course, is much more than your average inkeeper. He's this legendary Kvothe, who's done all this and that and who's all powerful, and the scribe has come to write down his story. So this book is the first part of Kvothe's story told in Kvothe's voice. 
 The writing is beautiful, and I'm easily absorbed into the story. I find myself thinking about the book when I'm not reading, which is great! But then there's so much I didn't like about it that overshadows what I liked about the book. 
 Kvothe is haughty as all hell and unbearable as an MC because of it. Most of the time, I can't stand him. The only character I began to like was Bast, one of the fae, who had a character that wasn't just limited to ""jovial supportive character talking about women"" or ""empathizing supportive character talking about women"". Sure he talks about women, but there was actual depth to him other characters lacked--their world was limited to their interactions with Kvothe. And yeah, yeah, it makes sense because this is Kvothe telling the story, but as a reader it wasn't such a fun experience, especially when the book is over 600 pages. 
 There's also a disgusting lack of women here--it's even pointed out by Bast at one point. If it's even pointed out by a character within your story, you should know you have a fundamental problem. Sure, there's the ""love interest"", Denna, who comes and goes because she's so independent, and Devi, a shady businesswoman, but one or two strong women in a story with, what? 25+ male characters does't make up for the difference. 
 Because for real, every girl or woman Kvothe meets is measured by how beautiful she is. When one girl sings beautifully while he plays, he naturally tries to find her afterward in the crowd. But the only girls he considers are the beautiful ones, because only pretty girls can have beautiful voices, right? Women are talked about like objects from the very beginning, and by every male character. God, it's wearying. 
 There's also a marked lack--and by that I mean absolutely zero--of nonwhite characters. How does this entire world exist but contain only white people? There's even people called the Ruh who have cultural identities based off nonwhite cultures in our world, but in Patrick Rothfuss's world . . . they're white. That's such a disgusting use of cultural appropriation. 
 So I'm sorry, friend, what I enjoyed didn't make up for what I didn't enjoy. :(""",2015-01-09 14:06:15,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
502,14975,3,"""(actually 3.5 rounded down) 
 To be honest, there was a lot more in this book that I liked than I disliked, but I think it's mostly the writing and organization that gives this novel a low rating. 
 Pacing was not consistent throughout the novel and it put me off. It starts off at a very slow, deliberate pace. Then three quarters the way through it picks up lighting-fast and becomes this great page-turner only to have it drop and describe the rest of the plot in a narrative between two characters. The first half goes into detail about the politics and relationships and the development of characters I assumed were vital to the story only to have the last third mention what happened to them and (in some cases) their deaths in passing. 
 Don't get me wrong, there was much I liked about this book, the way it combined past and present one of them. I had thought from the beginning that the past-present connection would be cheesy and was dreading the moment the connection happened, but it was actually pretty heartfelt and meaningful. I really enjoyed that part. 
 Some characters were not as fleshed out as others (even though they were the main characters) but others were gloriously three-dimensional and won my heart. Guilhem in particular is in my opinion the strongest character and what kept the book going near the end for me. 
 All in all, this book had great depth in politics and atmosphere and setting but lacked in development and organization.

 WOW....Hold on to your panties ladies because Alessandra Torre is about to take you on a sexy ride. And when i say sexy, i mean panty-melting hot, need a cold shower right now sexy. This, is my opinion, her hottest book yet. 
 One of the things I loved so much about MI was the added element of suspense and this book was no different. Right from the prologue you know there is danger lurking in the shadows. And every time it started to slip your mind,a little reminder was thrown in that kept you turning the pages. I just couldn't put this book down. But just as badly as I wanted to know what happened, I also didn't want Brad and Julia's story to end. 
 When we first met Brad DeLuca in Blindfolded Innocence he was the epitome of rich playboy. In Masked Innocence he changed his ways and fell hard for Julia. But it was in End of the Innocence that his love and dedication to Julia really shined through the pages. Is it sad to be jealous of Julia....maybe. But she has Brad and i want him for myself. 
 EOTI starts right where MI left off. Recently engaged, Julia has to deal with meeting Brad's family as well as the aftermath of telling the women of the law firm about her engagement, who were less than understanding. I love how her confidence as a person and with her sexuality really developed in this book. She stood tall and proud, proving that nothing and no one could come between her and Brad. 
 This is one of the best trilogies I have ever read. Alessandra left no stones unturned, no questions unanswered in the conclusion of this series. All while delivering one of the sexiest books i've ever read. The love shared between Brad and Julia is undeniable. Soul mates. The trust they have in each other is inspiring. Alessandra's writing is magic, leaving you so engrossed in the story that the world around you disappears.

This novel, the second in the Temeraire series, offers us an alternative timeline where the British Empire has an Aerial Corps made up of dragons and the men and women (yes, women!) who crew and serve them. Our time is the early 1800s, or Regency, and our heroes are a navel captain named Will Lawrence and a black dragon named Temeraire. 
 The first novel, His Majesty's Dragon, tells how the two of them found each other, their training in the aerial corps, and their first battles against Bonaparte's dragon corps. Here we find out that Temeraire is a more special dragon than anyone knew, and the Chinese are hot under the collar about Britain's possession of him. 
 Once again Novik pays homage to the style of writing from this period, while making us care about Lawrence and Temeraire. However, for me, this series has reached its close.

 But on the other hand, the story dragged in places, especially near the beginning.

516,22642971,4,"""I was attracted to The Body Electric because altered memories is one of my favorite tropes. One of my longest running (and favorite) WIPs is about a future society with ever increasing mind control and a protagonist with hidden memories. This book was sort of homework for me in a way, because I really wanted to see how the lost memories were handled. It was also my first Beth Revis story, though I know she is pretty well known in the YA world for her Across the Universe series. 
 There was so much to enjoy in The Body Electric. Right off the bat, we are introduced to a unique setting: a rebuilt Malta. I loved that the book didn't take place in a dystopic North America, and that Revis put a lot of thought into her universe. The integrated technologies were just that -- nothing stood out starkly against the story or felt hokey. Even the disease that Ella's mother suffered from felt absolutely real and a terrifying result of biohacking! I have to say that the world was the part I enjoyed most about the story -- I could absolutely picture everything happening around Ella. 
 I was a little unsure about the reverie machines at first though. That aspect was a bit confusing to me, in how they really worked and why Ella could go inside another person's reverie. However, the scenes depicted inside the memories reminded me of Inception in an absolutely fabulous way. I was very impressed by how it was handled, and we could see parts of people's memories crumbling away as Ella played in their minds. I loved it! 
 The main drive of this book occurs after Ella meets Jack Tyler, a young man who claims she knew him well that Ella has no memory of. After this point, the story moves super fast, and there's chase scenes, terrorist attacks and some intense hiding out. It was paced as well as any action movie, and though it felt a little predictable, I still enjoyed the ride. 
 If I could extend one critique though, it would be the lukewarm romance. Jack Tyler felt like a pretty flat character. I couldn't really tell you much about him now, other than he's smart and fills Ella in on a lot of exposition. That's another risk you run with memory loss stories, and he did feel like the platform to which provide Ella answers. And, I can't help but be annoyed by his name. Jack Tyler reminds me of Rose Tyler and she's not on the top of my favorite companions list. ;) 
 In regards to that, Jack's name was no accident. I read Revis's note at the end of the novel, and she pointed out a lot of the Easter eggs in her story. I thought this was pretty cool, and while some of them flew right over my head, it is fun to find them. If you've read a lot of classic Sci-Fi, I am confident you'll pick up on a lot! 
 Overall, this was a really excellent Sci-Fi YA read! The book was pretty hard to put down, and our main character Ella has a lot of drive and great qualities that make you root for her. There was a certain amount of predictability, but also some surprises that will impress.""",2014-10-01 14:45:40,The Body Electric,young-adult;fiction;romance;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Beth Revis

A point came when I am pretty sure Katherine Dunn just made up freaky stuff for shock value ~ not that I was offended or shocked by any means. Normally the crazier a book is, the more I love it. But in this case, I believe the story suffered as a result. 
 Long before the novel ends the reader learns that the Bineweski family, friends, and associates are not just ""freaks"" on the outside ~ they are misfits on the inside as well. But even so, we don't actually learn why. Ok ~ I know they were raised by disfunctional parents in a traveling carnival. But none of the characters felt real. They were all very one dementional and I never did feel as if I understood anyone's true motivation or desire. 
 By the time I was halfway through, I hated Oly, hated the story and hated the writing. To add insult to injury the Bineweski story ended in such a short, abrupt manner... I felt as if Dunn herself was also sick of her project and just wanted to be done with it in the fastest manner possible.""",2009-11-07 06:17:50,Geek Love,fiction;fantasy;paranormal,Katherine Dunn
520,8683812,3,"""I was never terribly interested in Hemingway in my undergrad years but after my husband gave me A MOVEABLE FEAST to read before our trip to Paris for our honeymoon, I've started a love affair with the man. THE PARIS WIFE piqued my interest from the date of its publication but it was one of those books that the reviews always seemed to be mixed: People either really loved it or found it to be boring and unworthy as a historical fiction portrait of Hemingway/Hadley. I hemed and hawed on purchasing the novel, but waiting list at the library (which was forever long), so I finally sucked it up and bought it on my Kindle. 
 As a historical portrait of the time and period, I found much of the novel to be spot on. It was clearly very well researched in that regard. But that's where the books promise ends - the characters were all flat and Hadley was simpering and weak. The big pitch about the storyline was Hadley was a woman very much toe to toe with Hemingway in wit, intelligence, and in life and you get none of this in this book. At times I found the book a struggle to get through, but I finished it out of stubbornness. 
 A ficiotnalized history of someone should be written to inspire the reader to learning more about the person(s) of the time and this is the big failure of A PARIS WIFE. If I had not already had a burgeoning interest in Hemingway and a vague obsession for Paris in the '20s, this book would not have sent me in pursuit to learn more about the man or his crowd, which is a travesty. 
 There were also a few nitpicky editing decisions that were out of sync. For example, there is a scene where Hadley/Hemingway are having loads of hot sexytimes and then a few paragraphs later, they go have hot sexytimes again but Hemingway gets in a snit because they forgot to bring condoms - which totally belies the previous scene where they were having hot sexytimes all over the place. There are also issues where continuity was in question and never addresed. 
 I would not recommend this title because it does a disservice to Hemingway/Hadley, the writing is often flat and a lot of the supporting characters that were larger then life (Gertrude Steine, Fitzgerald, etc) seemed like secondary puppets on a small supporting stage. I gave it a three because there are a few moments of brilliancy in the book, but often it is from direct quotes of Hemingway's work.""",2012-07-15 12:31:14,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

524,186074,4,"""Patrick Rothfuss brings alive all the moments and experiences that are often glazed over in Fantasy and manages to weave them together into a book that is so easy to read it feels like a stroll though the park. His skill with prose and creating a fully realised world wherever he places his characters is obvious and it is an absolute joy to be able to let go and be taken on a journey. Whether in the forest, on a roof, in a bar or in a library, everything feels real and completely imaginable. Not since reading American Gods by Neil Gaiman have I felt so comfortable with trusting the driver and enjoying the ride. 
 Patience is an important part of this book, for some of the characters and the reader, who are both eager to hear the story of Kvothe, a man of great renown about who much is spoken as legend but little known as fact. Telling the story is an Innkeeper called Kote who knows it truest, as it is his own. After a fairly leisurely introduction where we get a feel for the man he has become whilst we wait to hear about the man he was, we learn he has had many names because of his many experiences and so his will be a tale of many stories. 
 Our companions in hearing the tale are a man, or something far more, who goes by the name Bast and a storyteller who has come seeking the tale of Kvothe known as the Chronicler. When he asks to hear the tale he is told it will take three full days to tell properly. 
 The idyllic nature of his life at the beginning is of course too good to be true, but despite knowing this, it is next to impossible not to form a close emotional link with Kvothe and his family. They are wonderful people and they sing and play and perform together and their love for each other is infectious. Usually in a book like this I am thinking where are the swords and the fights but in this I was eagerly looking for the next time he played his lute or even practiced. 
 Sadly his father's insistence on finding a song for an ancient evil, the Chadrian, brings them into a darker world. Parts of this book were so sad and when Kvothe broke out of his tale and took a moment, so did I. The thought of this big man weeping out the back of his tavern was enough for me to put the book down for a bit and just reflect. 
 A great tragedy of Kvothes life is that he never quite gets the girl he loves, yet even more tragic is that despite knowing almost from day one that she could never be his, he cannot help but follow his heart and care for her. Rothfuss does a great job of getting us attached to a character, mirroring the relationship they have with Kvothe, and then taking them away so we also feel that sense of loss and emptiness that they are gone. 
 A couple of negatives for me were that at times it felt a bit repetitive with many moments beginning and ending with him looking for Denna. I also found Kvothe's fight with the Draccus (a large fire breathing herbivore) an odd part as I didn't find it added to the plot much. Selfishly I'd also like to have more happen. As much as I loved the prose I expected a little more scope and action to the first book and for Kvothe to be in a different place at the end than he was in the beginning. 
 Overall a fantastic book, I can see what all the fuss was about and I cannot wait to pick up The Wise Man's Fear.....which I am doing right now.

525,8683812,4,"""I'm giving this book 4 stars because I think Paula McLain does an extraordinary thing with it: she skilfully conducts the reader's sympathies from one place near the start of the book to quite another by the end, at least in my experience of it. In the beginning, Ernest Hemingway is the shining, golden boy, viewed so lovingly by the narrator that it's hard not to see him as a heroic figure, whereas the narrator herself... I kept telling myself I was being too hard on Hadley, that she was a product of her time and experiences, but by the middle of the book, when she was comparing herself with more ""modern"" women of her acquaintance, I about lost patience with her. The Hadley of the first three fifths of the book is exactly the kind of woman I dislike: passive-aggressive, unable to make (especially female) friends, completely emotionally dependent on a man and, to put it bluntly, quite stupid. The whole segment with her losing the valise, then forgetting her diaphragm, right after the bit where she mopes because Hem chose his work over her -- my God, as the reader, I have an insight into her interior life and even I thought she was at least subconsciously trying to sabotage him. And while I'm sympathetic to her ideas of mothering as a calling (as well as her frank need for breaks from her kid,) I found something entirely self-satisfied in the way she became a mother, illustrated by her ""Two men, now... And both of them mine"" thought right after Bumby is born. People aren't possessions, and to think otherwise is gross. The blurbs for this book trumpet the ""extraordinary bond"" between Hadley and Hem, but I thought they had a fairly normal marital relationship, worse in some ways and better in others, perhaps made more than ordinary by his work and travels. Perhaps I just have higher standards for what an ""extraordinary bond"" is. Regardless, I found the Hadley of the first 60% of this book tiresome. 
 But a strange thing happens right about when Kitty Cannell is introduced. Hadley starts making friends, just as Hem begins to be more obviously self-absorbed. Kitty encourages Hadley to broaden her horizons beyond just being Hem's wife, which Hem, naturally, hates Kitty for (leading to the rather vicious portrayal he wrote of her as Frances in The Sun Also Rises.) And then Duff enters the picture. Despite Hem's infatuation with her, Duff is too busy with her other admirers to consummate an affair, much to Hadley's relief. I have to say, I thought it was appalling how Hadley convinced herself that Hem's attentions towards Duff were more writerly than romantic. There is really only so much self-delusion a person should undertake. 
 And then... Pauline. Oh, Pauline. Kitty, who's my favorite person in this whole mess, says it best when she tells Hadley, ""Freedom is one thing, but you draw the line at a friend's husband."" Even as Pauline abandons self-respect (that whole situation in the Antibes? Appalling) and Hem tries to pretend that he's acting out of love instead of pure selfishness, Hadley finally rises to the occasion and tells them both to stuff it. She is hurt and still in love, but she finally understands that her sense of self-worth is more important than a lover's feelings, no matter how strong the ""bond"". This is a very important lesson for anyone to learn, and I'm glad Hadley didn't allow herself to languish in misery for the sake of an intermittent happiness. 
 Anyway, this book resonated because of personal life etc. but I did greatly admire Ms McLain's skill with characterization and narrative. It's a very readable account of important literary figures that never hews far from the facts, which is what makes Ms McLain's feat even more impressive. Whereas Hem had leeway to mold the reality of his experiences into a form he thought most flattering to himself, Ms McLain sticks solidly to evidence to depict what is ultimately a sympathetic portrait of Hadley Richardson.""",2012-05-31 20:32:45,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

 So the plot is that Amy, Mac's best friend is murdered by a werewolf and the Trackers or werewolf hunters are called into town. Only for everything to get worse instead of better. The werewolf hunters are more monstrous than the 'monsters' they hunt. Mac ends up trying to find the killing on her own. Jason, Amy's boyfriend drinks all the time now and joins the Trackers, and Kyle the other friend has a secret that could ruin everything. 
 The characters were all deep and well portrayed. The plot was great with a lot of twists and turns and betrayals, lies, people not being who they say they are, guilt, and love. There is a love triangle in it but this time it doesn't retract from the story, instead it makes it better. Mac makes new friends and strengthens old ones. It was very well written.

554,13449677,5,"""Originally posted on my blog!! :) :) 
 There was so much hype for this book before it was even published. Everywhere I turned (in the lovely world of the internet, bloggers and goodreads that is) there was all out excitement for this book called The Collector. And girls everywhere were swooning over this guy that most of them didn't even know yet named Dante Walker. Though I couldn't blame them, I mean seriously, Dante freakin' Walker...the name just oozes sexiness. So I was curious and did some poking around and pulled up the blurb... 
 He makes good girls...bad. 
 Yep. That's all it took. My next thought was... 
 But you had to worry and wonder, with all this hype and excitement.....would the book be able to hold up? Would it be any good? Good? No. Freakin awesome? Hell yeah! Pow! I don't think you see enough ""Pow!"" on a day to day basis. Ha. Anyway. 
 Hands down, Charlie is my all time favorite book heroine. Period. I mean she finds happiness and joy in anything. Seriously anything...jumping on the bed for crying out loud! How can you not love someone like that? And she was nothing like I anticipated her to be. But you know, that's okay. I liked this Charlie. Start to finish. And then there's Dante. He's an arrogant, self centered, cocky, materialistic, soul collecting demon from hell. Yeah I'm with you. I love him too. I don't think I've had as much fun reading a character in a long, long time. Even if he made me cry. Twice. Jerkface. 
 This book is filled with humorous moments and dialogue. You can really see Victoria Scott's personality shine in this book. Most of us have been following her for a while before the book was released and you can see it in her blog posts and things like that. So even before I started reading it, I knew I was going to be laughing. A lot. Nothing else was predictable though, every time I'd think I had something or someone figured out I kept ending up wrong. I hate being wrong! 
 It's funny. Before I started blogging I never really paid much attention to acknowledgements. It was sort of a ""Ehh. Books done time to move on."" I don't know why doing this sort of thing changed that but I'm glad I did I cracked up at the end.

561,186074,3,"""So, I avoided reading this for the longest time. I could say it was because I usually avoid reading things that everyone else loves. That's true but not applicable here. I saw it in the bookstore several years ago, was intrigued, picked it up and read the jacket copy. And was immediately turned off, by something incredibly stupid. (My reaction or the something? You decide. But probably both.) Okay, so the main character's name is Kvothe, pronounced ""quothe."" Benvenuto Cellini works as a name. So did Hail Rosamer. Kvothe makes me cringe every time I see it. So that's why I never read this book until now. Despite having read the book, it still strikes me as overly precious, twee, and meta. I seriously considered replacing the name with other things, like Logos, Savoir, or Hamentash (don't ask). Sometimes I read it as ""Kote,"" another name the protagonist goes by. 
 Anyway. My name-related neuroses aside, this is an all right book. Interesting story, shame about the protagonist? That's kind of tongue in cheek. This is a problem that some stories run into - how to have an exceptionally talented main character without them being Stu-ish? I think here it's averted a bit by K. being a naive habitual liar and rule-breaker. Yes, really. 
 Not too long ago I read a post where Kristine Kathryn Rusch talked about why people like John Grisham and Stephen King sell piles of copies while others just struggle along. She claimed it's because they're good storytellers, rather than because they worry about ""pretty sentences."" As people who are familiar with my reading tastes might suspect, that made me feel a tiny bit insecure. I eventually concluded that while of course I want a good story, I want pretty sentences AND proper attention paid to grammar and spelling and punctuation too. And I want the fat to be ruthlessly carved away. But since it seems like almost everyone who reads fantasy loves this, I went into this thinking that maybe they loved it because there was a good exciting story. 
 Is there? Well, sort of. Maybe. There's a framing story of K. telling the story of his life until now. It kind of worked for Anne Rice in Interview With the Vampire, I guess? It's been a while since I read that book, but I faintly remember that she managed to make the interview segments suspenseful. (I may be fabricating that out of whole cloth, since, as I said, it's been a while.) Here there's a lot of description/telling, instead of showing. 
 It's clear that hero-stories sell well. But ... I dunno, I've read so many of them. I want something with an interesting twist. Bast and Auri are interesting, but they don't get that much page real estate. It doesn't help that this book is, as K. notes, setting the stage for later parts of his life story. This book is 662 pages and I feel like it could have been elided without my missing much. On the other hand, if you're going to be flying, this is just the thing to haul with you on a plane trip (if you don't mind the weight). 
 It does have some dialogue I enjoyed. But it also had some darlings I felt needed to be murdered. (Here's an example. Not a traditional spoiler, but if you feel like you don't want your impressions colored at all, don't click. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.  I think that could work for me in another story, but it doesn't seem to fit with this one.) I feel like maybe Rothfuss was a better writer by the end of this than the was at the beginning. Which makes a certain amount of sense, as he talks about numerous drafts and having worked on this book for 14 years.""",2011-02-23 05:20:35,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

566,186074,4,"""Here is the hero in his own words. (Excuse the long quote, but, as I often find, the beauty of prose is most poignant with context.) 
 ""My name is Kvothe, pronounced nearly the same as 'Quothe.' Name are important as they tell you a great deal about a person. I've had more names than anyone has a right to. 
 The Adem call me Maedre. Which, depending on how it's spoken, can mean 'The Flame,' 'The Thunder,' or 'The Broken Tree.' 
 'The Flame' is obvious if you've ever seen me. I have red hair, bright. If I had been born a couple hundred years ago I would probably have been burned as a demon. I keep it short but it's unruly. When left to its own devices, it stick up and make me look as if I have been set afire. 
 'The Thunder' I attribute to a strong baritone and a great deal of stage training at an early age. 
 I've ever thought of 'The Broken Tree' as very significant. Although in retrospect I suppose it could be considered at least partially prophetic. 
 My first mentor called me E'lir because I was clever and I knew it. My first real lover called me Dulator, because she liked the sound of it. I have been called Shadicar, Lightfinger, and Six-String. I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe Kingkiller. I have earned those names. Bought and paid for them. 
 But I was brought up as Kvothe. My father once told me it meant 'to know.' 
 I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned. 
 I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the twon of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. 
 You may have heard of me."" (pages 56-57) 
 Things I loved: it is a fantasy novel and the protag is a big damn hero, BUT you really get a sense that he hasn't ""fixed"" the world and that there is a lot going on around him that he a. has no control over and b. doesn't even necessarily know about. I think that this first thing I loved might change as the series/trilogy/I 
 This is the cover I have, aka the paperback. But the hardback is much prettier. 
 have no idea how long it is goes on, as this first book is essentially a set up (I have a feeling it might even be the set up for the set up, though it is already setting things up and I should stop talking now), but it is a thing that I loved. From the quote above, you also know that he isn't universally beloved. Like many real 'heroes', who is a hero and who is not depends entirely on who you ask. 
 Thematically, I loved this book. Rothfuss is questioning what makes a hero, which is a question my favorite book (The Last Unicorn) also takes on. He is also tackling what unmakes a hero, which is just as wonderful a question. See below for an example of the gorgeosity of his wonderments. 
 Also, holy carp, that prose. It's intelligent: from near the end of the book (but spoiler free, of course): ""It's like everyone tells a story about themselves inside their own head. Always . All the time. That story makes you what you are. We build ourselves out of that story."" (pg 716) It's also beautiful, as I think I have already proven. And, lastly, it's often funny! ""I also felt guilty about the three pens I'd stolen. And since there was no convenient way to give them back, I stole a bottle of ink before I left."" This is a book written by a guy who thinks about life and about people and he does some really amazing things with his words. 
 Of course, it was written by a guy, and while I really enjoyed the female characters and thought they were interesting and wanted to learn more about them... I didn't get to. The main female lead is a romantic one that Kvothe worships. And ya'll know how much I love it when a guy worships a gal!* (*pukes*) There are four(?) other female characters who have any significance in the book: Kvothe's mother, his loan shark, a peer, and a... girl who is hard to describe. To compare numbers, I count well over ten male characters of similar significance. Also, all four (five, including the romantic lead) are, in different ways, very attractive, which would enough to raise flags by itself, to be honest. There are huge swaths of the book where women don't show up at all, including the time in the inn. And lastly, it seems like women are very rarely in positions of power. For instance, all of the masters at the University are male. So it fails a bit on that front, although not nearly as badly as many other things I have read. It also doesn't, to my memory, mention anybody who's not white. So, you know. 
 Honestly, I hate to keep harping on this subject. I would love to not feel I have to mention this lack that keeps appearing. But as long as it does, I will keep talking about it. 
 But all in all, I am ever so glad I read it and it was well worth getting past the first hundred pages or so. I should mention that the first hundred pages are far from bad, and looking back it was a wonderful way to start the novel, just that they didn't grip me. As usual, if anybody would like to borrow it from me, just let me know! I will need to hold on to it, though, because I think this is one I'm going to reread at least once. And I think I'm going to buy the sequel as soon as it's out in paperback. Or maybe when it's out at all. ;___; 
 *For anybody who might not know, when I see that what I see is a guy who wants to get to know a girl because he wants to get into her pants (essentially). I don't see a guy who wants to get in a girl's pants because he knows her. And all too often, though this isn't the case with Kvothe imo, the guy doesn't actually really want to get to know the girl. He just wants to worship her. And get in her pants.""",2009-11-25 08:35:34,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

580,10806009,3,"""I finished this book with a grimace. I started out enjoying it, but quickly became confused and bored. There were a lot of things to like--the poetic quality of the writing (I thought the translation was decent), the way the author wove the fairy tale into the main story, the complicated nature of the relationships, the difference of this book from other YA books. And Anna was a decent heroine. However, the book progressed a little too slowly to hold my interest all the way through. I got tired of the parallels between the fairy tale and reality. Was it really necessary for even Anna to constantly refer to the social services office as shells and sisters even inside her own head?  
 As others have pointed out, this book took a dark turn pretty early on. I don't have a problem with dark stories, but sometimes things are just too tragic to be palatable. Anna said she couldn't forgive Abel for what he did, and yet it seemed as if she did just that, even if she never said the words. That was the one problem I had with her as a heroine, and it was even more of a problem after she and Abel had consensual sex. I mean, WHAT?  As for Abel, I could only sympathize with him up to a point. Regardless of what happened to him as a child  or ""threats"" to Mia, I felt his actions had little justification. And I rarely, if ever, have any sympathy whatsoever for a character who commits suicide . 
 So. While the writing and poetry were nice, I just did not enjoy this story overall.""",2012-04-09 16:01:48,The Storyteller,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal;fiction,Antonia Michaelis

 A great follow up book!! 
 Asher 'Ghost' and Nat had a one night stand in the previous book and this story starts about a year after that. Basically they stopped talking to each other even though neither of them wanted too but Nat was trying to protect her heart whereas Ghost wasn't ready to fight it. However when they become neighbours they are both forced to get along. 
 Asher is a great tortured hero. He suffered horrific abuse as a child which has made him close off, anti social and untrusting. He finds an instant connection to Nat, she unknowingly calms him and ease his pains so when she cut off contact he suffers greatly. Nat is terrified by how Asher makes her feel and her past history with men is so bad so decides it's not worth the effort. The chemistry between the pair is amazing and the witty banter is hilarious. Asher is a guy of few words but he is honest, loyal and actually pretty sweet. 
 I love reading about them falling in love. Asher had to learn from scratch because he didn't know what love was but once Nat had decided on him she was more than happy to spend the time to show him. 
 The writing was again great and the secondary characters add so much to the story. I loved catching up with Nik and Tina, Max, Lola and Trick. The amazing thing about this and the previous book is the relatability of the characters, you actually care what happens to them. 
 It has the hilarious misunderstandings, drama and steamy sex of the previous book with some great new characters thrown in. I can't wait for Max and Helena's story.""",2013-07-13 03:22:43,"Love Thy Neighbour (Friend-Zoned, #2)",romance;fiction,Belle Aurora

 There were somethings like a really enjoyed about this book like the paranormal fantasy aspect of the story. It was pretty well written and the characters weren't super annoying. 
 However, I don't like mystery and suspense that leaves me feeling confused so it was a struggle to get into the story. Right away, there's a lot of suspense and mystery and while I know a lot of people like that in a story, I'm not a big fan of it. 
 It did take a long time before the main character and reader knew what was happening with all strange things that was happening to the main character. I'm also not a big fan of the in books. But again, I know some people like this. 
 Not a lot happens in the first half of this book so I was almost speed reading to get to the main point of this book. 
 Tied has a very ""classic"" YA vibe to it. It's not extremely original and it has the typical romance that's common in YA. 
 Overall, this book just wasn't for me. It had a lot of things that I personally don't like in books and it wasn't quite original enough to completely keep my attention. But you like classic YA, a lot of suspense and mystery from page one, than Tied is probably a book you'd like.

592,15797848,0,"""ARC was sent to me by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. 
 Review is from advance partial reading copy 
 I was very curious to read There's Someone Inside Your House. I've read a couple of Stephanie Perkins' other books and this sounded nothing like her normal fluffy, cute romances and I'm 100% down for authors trying new, unexpected genres. 
 There's Someone Inside Your House starts off with bang. The first chapter has the first murder and it's fairly fast paced. My advance partial reading copy was 151 pages and if I remember correctly, it took place in a week's time or close to a week. 
 The murders are very gory and horrific but of the ones I read about, they weren't overly detailed. They are described bluntly but not with a ton of graphic details. It would also be easy to skip over the gore if you really didn't want to read that. 
 I liked the main character, Makani. I thought it was very cool that she was a PoC and there was diversity in this book. She talks about being African American/ Native Hawaiian several times through out the book and addresses a few of her experiences as a PoC. 
 I'm not easily scared when it comes to reading horror books but a couple of the murders had me a little paranoid at night. I was surprised how scary this book actually was. 
 I loved the setting of this book. It's set in a small town in Nebraska and as someone from a nowhere town that's 20 minutes from Nebraska, I could relate to a lot of the things going on in this book. 
 This has nothing to do with the book or the author but I'm really annoyed that the publisher sent out advance partial reading copies. I was sent There's Someone Inside Your House in an elaborate PR box along with four other ARCs of their biggest fall releases and I was very disappointed to see that only 151 pages of the book was included. None of the other reviews I've read mention that their review is from a partial ARC so either they decided not to mention it or they all had complete copies. It doesn't make sense to me to have both complete ARCs and partial ARCs and it's unfair that some reviewers would have an advantage with complete copies. As it is, I can't give a real review because I only have 151 pages. Granted, I did really enjoy those 151 pages but I can't fully review a book I can't finish. 
 I do have a theory of who the killer is. There was a pretty big hint with one of the murders. Honestly, it was such a big hint towards a character that it took away a lot of the mystery. I can also see that its a fake hint. It points to a character so directly that it could be there just to try to throw off the reader. 
 I'll update my review and give a rating when I buy a finished copy on release day. From the 151 pages, I'd give There's Someone Inside Your House four stars.""",2015-02-26 11:09:08,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins
593,1122023,4,"""A well-crafted ghost story that showcases Sokoloff's history as a screenwriter. This story straddles the line between psychological thriller and paranormal chiller, as five outcast students (each with his or her own baggage) stay behind in their secluded college hall during semester break. 
 The five gravitate toward each other out of boredom and loneliness and also due to a historical discovery of a tragedy that occurred in the same hall to a former student many years ago. 
 Throughout the book, Sokoloff expertly keeps the reader guessing as to the real nature of the happenings, is there really a ghost lurking about or is one or more of the students playing mind games with the others?

595,29780253,4,"""I'm (obviously) a fan of Trevor Noah; I think he's done well to fill the big shoes of Jon Stewart, his predecessor on The Daily Show. So I was already predisposed to like this memoir when I picked it up, but I think it could entertain the average open-minded nonfan as well. 
 Each chapter opens with a page about the history of colonization, oppression and apartheid that South Africa was steeped in over centuries of European rule. About half-way through, these mini-history lessons became less general and more personal in how they applied to him, but not less informative. I have never learned so much broad history from a such scant offerings. 
 His breakdown of the relationship between racism and language is beautiful and succinct: ""If you spoke to me in Zulu, I replied to you in Zulu. If you spoke to me in Tswana, I replied to you in Tswana. Maybe I didn't look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you."" 
 Trevor's love for his mother comes through clearly and constantly, even when he is numerating all the ways they clashed (his mischievous ways as a child, his devil's advocate stance in regard to her piousness, etc.) He foreshadowed the violence they would face at the hands of his stepfather early on and that hung over every interaction he wrote about her like a vulture waiting to swoop in - it was bittersweet to read about the funny moments he had with his mother, knowing she would soon be a victim of domestic abuse. The acknowledgement of both his original anger at why she stayed and his ignorance of how abusive relationships worked is unusual, but I think it exemplifies the good man he grew up to be, the good man his mother raised against so many odds.

Brat Farrar and Daughter of Time were both epochs in my teenage life - Brat Farrar was the first real young adult novel I came across, although written about fifty years before the genre was recognised as such, while Daughter of Time was the first non-historical book I found that dealt seriously with Richard III, who was a teenage obsession of mine. 
 Onto this book: Nicola Upson is clearly a gifted writer and plotter, but I found the pedestrian storytelling wearying at times. At one point early on in the novel, we jump through about eight characters' heads, one after the other, most of whom we haven't met before. It's one way to introduce characters, but I much prefer to be left inside a single character's head and see the action unfolding from her point of view - and I feel this is a much better way to create suspense, given that we're reading a crime novel. 
 There are a couple of plot anvils, too: again early on, one character has a conversation with another that makes it absolutely clear that one of them will be dead in a few hours. I just feel...there's no need to do that. 
 I rather liked the denouement; Upson pulls no punches with her characters, and the twisty storylines come together nicely by the end. And she has a beautiful way with words, when she's not trying to spoonfeed her reader. The characters are interesting enough to live on inside my head, so I'll be reading the second one, and I hope she's tightened up her storytelling in that one.""",2012-05-30 13:49:12,"An Expert in Murder (Josephine Tey, #1)",mystery;thriller;crime;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography,Nicola Upson

 Well, that was a huge disappointment. 
 I enjoyed the opening, where darkness is clearly coming for an unsuspecting (and admittedly homelier than thou and paper-thin) rural community. I was intrigued by the main character, and even liked the first couple of hundred pages of his meandering recap of his life. Then the book started to drag, and drag, and drag. About halfway through, I figured out that by the end of the book, we'd probably be back to the start and find out what was actually happening with the world now. 
 I was sadly mistaken. By the end of the book, we still don't know how on earth Kvothe ended up in his current situation, and I am left wondering if the entire story is going to be this picaresque adventure, leaving the reader with no development from the opening scenes. 
 Rothfuss is a good storyteller. One reason I kept reading despite mounting frustration was because a lot of the twists and turns of the story are fun, and he's a decent writer (who needs to chop out at least half of his adverbs!). That's why the book gets three stars - I can see that for some readers, this would be a great book, and perhaps that's why the sequel seems to have been so eagerly awaited by many. 
 The characterisation isn't great. Kvothe himself is a fun character, and I liked several of the others, but by and large the supporting cast is made up of ciphers and cliches. With a couple of exceptions, the female characters in the book are weeping, terrified servant girls. In an apparent attempt to rescue the book from a sea of sexism, one chapter is devoted to the difficult situations of women who are without protectors in this world. It's a relief to see this, but it doesn't change the fact that seeing such a male world, with two female characters who are more than ciphers, makes for uncomfortable reading. 
 Where are the mothers, sisters and daughters of all these men who populate the pages? Non-existent, from what I can tell. In the setting that opens and closes the book, ie the one in which the rest of the story is purportedly told, there are no female characters at all. 
 For all that, I want to know the rest of the story. This is another reason for my three-star review - despite all my problems with the book, I still want to know what happens.

 It's crazy how fast the craving comes back to devour another one of Kandi's books, after you've sobered from the last. 
 The ARC sat there, on my Kindle, just like it had with Weightless five months before. Except this time, there was warning, a bestie release, and I knew Kandi would leave yet another mark on my heart - with her words. 
 It was just her words - the old friend, the easy flow, the twisted heartache wrapped in a stunning cover. 
 It was just me -- the reader, pretending like I didn't want to get lost in the world she'd created, realizing too quickly that months of being clean only made me long for more of her words. 
 But we can't start here. 
 No, to make you feel the little piece of her heart she's given us right, you need to go to Amazon and one click.

 1. The romance was horrible, horribly written and it would be better if it wasn't there at all. 
 This was my main issue with the book. The romance seemed almost forced to the story, as it was added only for the sake of being there because ""it is supposed to be that way"". 
 2. I didn't really like the main character. He was interesting and had potential, but many times acted arrogantly and sometimes was a bully. Or plainly stupid. 
 3. The beginning was very slow and almost made me ""quit"" the book, but after 100-ish pages, it gets more and more gripping 
 Apart from that I enjoyed this book. Setting was great, made me want to know more about University and generally the world. Side characters were amazing. That makes me want to read the next one. I have a feeling it will be even better.

I think it captured the feeling it was meant to convey, which is sort of isolated, especially in a world where we are less isolated by technology. 
 The story isn't something new. But, it was a story that was told well and in an intelligent, artistic way. That ending line, for instance, was poetic even. Just beautiful. I like reading about AI even though the themes involving their sentience, rights, and things like that have been done before. I like the idea of this robot being sent to him when he felt lonely, because I think a lot of people do go to the internet when they feel alone. But, it's interesting, because one thing that it made me think about is how frustrating it can be when you ask someone what they want to do, or what they like, or their opinion, and they give you that horrible response of ""Well, I don't know, what do you want/like?"" If you wanted complete compliance, you wouldn't have bothered asking, and you may not have even bothered with company. But, we all say it. And yet, Alex, the main character, is sort of struggling to get over his girlfriend leaving him, so it's interesting how he wants to give Ada free will, knowing that she will leave him if she chooses to do so, and he doesn't really want the robot to leave either.

 I'm such a huge fan of this series, you have no idea and Darkness was a great installment even if i missed the funny moments and the whole ""mine"" factor. 
 This book was a little different than the rest. Focused more on the couple and less on the on-going plotlines, it was both refreshing and unique. But i couldn't shake the yearning i felt, for the all-time favorite action packed, mate frenzy!! 
 Kat is an FBI agent sent inside Homeland under false pretenses in order to locate and help escape Borris. We all know him and hate him. Her timing though isn't very good and she ends up in a dangerous situation, saves the day, but betrays with her actions the fact that she is not just a consultant. 
 That's how she finds herself cornered by Darkness who, lets face it, almost hates everyone. He is cold, highly controlled, doesn't open up and hasn't have a woman for a long, long time. Well his Kat will change all that. He'll lose control in a way he swore he never would ans he'll find himself asking for so much more.

I have only read Armentrouts NA books, I have yet to read anything else by her, which is a shame really because I own a couple of her YA novels that are currently glaring at me from the bookcase. She is an amazing author that evokes a long of feelings for me with her writing, even if not all of them are necessarily good. Forever with You was one of those books I love to hate because of the difficult subject matter. After reading the synopses, you kind of know what's coming, it's like a train wreck ready to tear you apart, but you are unable to put it down. Mostly because you kind of hope it will heal you in the end... At one point when I told my husband why I was so upset, he asked me why was I even continuing to read this. I honestly didn't know, aside from the fact that not everything I read is going to shelter me from the darker side of life and the other part is, well, Armentrouts writing was still hard to put down, no matter how painful it was. 
 The Characters 
 Nick and Stephanie are the two stars of the show in this book. Nick is a bartender who ends up having a one night stand with Stephanie based on the pure attraction between them. So yes, they jump into a love scene from the very first few pages of the book - but that's okay, because it sets up a whirlwind of events that follow the consequences of that one night. 
 Stephanie is an interesting character. She believes in love, but she doesn't do relationships unless she feels that they are worth it. She has no issues with discovering the other person to feel if they click before committing to anything, and that is what she feels sets her apart from other girls her age. She doesn't feel like the girlfriends of her previous fling like her, but as the book goes on her opinion of them and how they really see her changes. Nick is a one night stand type of guy. But he isn't a bad guy, he just has a lot going on in his personal life that we don't see until later in the book, so it's understandable why he doesn't do relationships, especially if it already had a negative effect on one he use to have. 
 Together, they are amazing. The heat, the lust, and the physical dynamic are all there. I loved the banter, I loved the connection. I especially loved how the two grow together given the circumstances and how it affected them later on in the book when the tragedy struck. 
 The Plot 
 I don't know... I really don't. I really liked the book I did, but I am going to be honest. It was one of the hardest books to read. I am not oblivious that things like this happen and I applaud Armentrout for having the guts to write about this subject matter, but for me, it was difficult - especially knowing that it was coming, so reading the book and basically just wondering when it was going to strike. I don't expect a lot of people to be comfortable with it and maybe I am wrong, because Armentrout does handle it pretty well, and maybe it's because she is such a great author who's writing really captures your feelings. I cannot go too much into the plot, but basically it's about two people who are very much the same, who kind of find a way to deal with their similarities and differences when something happens that bring them close together. I don't want to spoil, so it's hard to talk about most of the plot. But I did love watching Steph and Nick grow, it was very heartfelt how they were brought together and how the tragedy didn't pull them apart. I am proud of Nick with the way he had handled it, even if I wanted to throttle Steph for being so stupid for thinking Nick would react differently otherwise. 
 The Writing 
 As I said before. I love the writing. I love Armentrout's NA series, so far I cannot say that I have been disappointed. There is a lot more steam in them, then in YA books, but that's understandable and I don't mind it, just a word of caution for those that have only read her YA series. Armentrout really knows how to build relationships in her books without making it boring. Each story told is very different, the circumstances that bring the characters together are also different, but they are all very true to life. I feel like I personally know the character's in her books. So well written, so well fleshed out. You also have to enjoy them reappearing throughout the series. The amount of emotion she has packed into this book was pretty powerful. What happened to Nick and Steph, I would not wish on anyone, but like Armentrout had said through her characters, something like this does happen, and it was interesting to see how the two mended their shattered world to move on. 
 In conclusion, besides how difficult the subject matter ended up being for me. I really did love this book. I am looking forward to the next book in the series, which is Brock's story, really excited about that one!This review was originally posted on Night Owl Book Cafe""",2015-09-23 19:13:47,"Forever with You (Wait for You, #5)",romance;fiction;young-adult,J.

648,186074,2,"""Although this book very well-written, and I finished it, I didn't much like it. Seems too few authors these days appreciate In Medias Res, and letting the reader find out things on their own. There's just too much information, some of which is uninteresting and irrelevant, and the pacing is horrendously slow. When the information load is that great, there isn't much room for surprises. We already know what happens to (young)Kvothe, so when he finds himself in a dangerous situation there's no thrill or excitement there, because we already know he's going to pull through. His life is never really at stake...I find the outer tale to be far more interesting, and I wish he'd spent more time on that in the first book. I am going to read the second book just to see how things happen, and if there's more of a development in older Kvothe's story. 
 But my main issue is that young Kvothe is, for me at least, a wholly unlikable character. He's too ""perfect"", he's selfish, ego-centric, reckless, disrespectful, inconsiderate and in general a major douche. But maybe I just think that about all teenage boys who have no siblings. A kid without siblings is an acquired taste, especially as grown-ups. 
 That said I didn't like Harry Potter much either. Oh, I loved the series, but HP himself is a brat. Ronny Weasley, on the other hand, is a wonderful character. 
 If I was going to compare this book to any other(without having read Lies) I would say Peter V Brett's The Painted Man.

The reason the first book, Unwind is on my forever favorites list is that it's one of the few dystopia books that basically punched me in the balls. I remember finishing it for the first time and having trouble breathing for the next five minutes because it was so horrifying. Not because of blood, gore, or an unnatural death account because the cruelty of humans was so realistic. The situation was cool, if not a bit cheese sci-fi complete with the lack of explanation about how this is all possible, but the humans were what really sold it. It made me so angry, and I will always love it for that. 
 However, after the first one the following books started drifting further down cheesy sci-fi lane. The Unwinding affects became wilder and more unbelievable, the people stopped being individuals and more like placeholders for necessary roles. While I loved the addition of Cam because he added yet another horrifying piece to the overall puzzle, everything else started degrading. I feel like Shusterman lost the elegant simplicity of the situation and just started to figure out how weird he could make everything and the books lost something because of it. 
 Not to say I don't love the series as a whole, I do. It has a special place in my heart, flaws and all but even though the ending wasn't too terrible, I really wish Shusterman tried harder to keep the special spark the first book had.

 But an unknown evil from the outside world is advancing towards this remote place and, willingly or not, he must confront it. 
 And while he does, we are introduced to his early life as a story he tells to a chronicler who has come to the village looking for him.

From feral child to impoverish student, he struggles to keep his dignity, hoping to learn the name of the wind that, he believes, will introduce him to a world of power he guesses must exist beyond the known world.

Yes, a certain darkness is alluded to - having to sleep with the light on; suicidal thoughts - but whenever he appears on the page, he's loud and brash and Hemmingway-esque in that ultra-macho, over the top way that seems divorced from reality. So how much is caricature and how much is the real man? 
 I guess for others, how much you appreciate this book depends on how affecting you find it. Whether you find the tale of Hemmingway's first marriage and its collapse (there's no spoiler there, even if you don't know what happened in life, the book is fairly open where it's headed) touching, sad and affecting. I have to say that I absolutely did believe in this love story and it did play sad songs on my heart strings right the way through. And that more than anything else allows me to overcome my doubts to say that this is a love story that got to me and a book I actually really enjoyed.""",2016-03-21 01:46:23,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain
682,14064,5,"""Reading a modern classic for the first time, one which has been adapted into a number of movies and to a certain extent has entered the culture, is a fine way to set oneself up for disappointment. How can it possibly match its reputation? How can it live up to the reader's preconceptions? How can it meet expectations? 
 I'm pleased to say that Richard Matheson's 'I am Legend' is a fantastic read which more than deserves its good name. 
 Despite the various adaptations making the monsters more zombie-like, this is one of the great vampire novels. A dark and claustrophobic tale of the last man alive after a horrible virus has rampaged its way through mankind. Despite having a whole cityscape to play with, the action is set mostly in Robert Neville's house. Now a fortress he spends each evening in, listening to classical music, sometimes getting drunk and watching as the same vampires come again and again to taunt him - only held back by his hard-found garlic. 
 What makes it so fascinating is that it's a character study as well as a vampire tale. This is the story of a man whose psyche is pushed to its outer limits, who's entered a world where hope and insanity are a flick of a coin away from each other. Over a period of years we see Neville who - for reasons he can only guess at - is immune to the vampire plague, as he goes through his daily routines and endures his night-time terrors. His grief for the past, his hopes for the future are all gradually subsumed by a desire and need to survive the present moment. 
 The title is explained in the very last paragraph, and the endgame building up to that is excellent. Even though the world beyond this apocalypse is one we can't recognise, it's a place that Matheson expertly helps us understand. And I think, in the final deadly conclusion, there's maybe even a sense of promise for the future. 
 Addendum - 23rd August, 2013 - Well, I finally got around to watching the Will Smith version of 'I am Legend' this week. (I know, I know, it came out in 2009 but I'm at last catching up. I'll be joining Facebook next week.) It has some expertly worked thrills and shocks and Smith is really strong in a lead role which demands he does all the heavy lifting, but in the whole I thought it was an opportunity wasted. Not because it ignores a lot of the book (I was expecting that), but because it ignores even its own interesting ideas. No doubt the problems lay behind the scenes; a credit which lists two screenwriters working off an original screenplay by two other screenwriters does suggest something of a muddle. That's no doubt why things were allowed to fritter out in such an annoying way. Abut mid-way through the zombies (once again the film is zombies rather than vampires) manage to capture Will Smith in exactly the same way - rope trap, falling car - which he captures them. Before this they are portrayed as having negligible intelligence, so to be able to pull together and execute their plan shows a remarkable leap forward. But it's an idea which is never allowed to grow. Rather than heading to the action movie noble sacrifice conclusion, the film should have taken a breather to examine the evolution of these creatures. Imagine how fascinating that would have been, a Hollywood film engaging in evolution post-mankind. An American film which stated that mankind was not God's last word. But no, despite his character making scientific observations earlier in the film, it's more important to have a speedy, adrenalin rush of a conclusion rather than actually examine ideas. But then that's basically the way big budget Hollywood films work, and that's the most irritating thing of all.""",2010-07-10 09:27:07,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson
683,29780253,5,"""This was one book I was dying to read when I heard about it. Because I LOVE TREVOR NOAH. I think he's one of the most insightful, witty journalists/comedians that are there today. Basically, I'm in love with him. 
 However, I was in love with only his work - his stand up shows, his work with The Daily Show (which I watch daily). I didn't really research his life, except to see if he has a girlfriend (which he does ). Which is why things that he said in his book were so shocking to me. I knew he lived in apartheid, I knew about his family and him being mixed - I just didn't understand the ramifications of having to live through that. 
 Having read the book I feel as though I'm in love again, but this time with his mother. What a pillar of strength, a force to be reckoned with, a rebel and a crusader of her times and ours! Basically, I love his family. 
 There were times I laughed and laughed, times when I was solemn and times I simply bawled. The painting that Trevor Noah painted of his life was fresh and you didn't have to look too closely to see the cracks, the bumps. But it was these cracks and bumps that made the painting so beautiful. 
 I would recommend this book to anyone - even if you haven't followed Trevor Noah's work because after this, you sure will.""",2016-12-02 13:50:57,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah

There are echoes of other stories in this book that make it seem familiar yet they're combined in such a way that the plot didn't seem tired. Peter's a bit like a Dickens character, the rather sudden and pervasive violence was very Grimm fairy tale-ish, Peg and her little group had a bit of a Lost Boys vibe, and the early part with Sir Tode and Peter reminded me of Don Quixote. On the whole, I enjoyed the writing style. I also liked how technology/science was the ""magic"" element in this story.

687,29064340,5,"""What can I say about KI Lynn and her books that I haven't already said a million times? When the blurb for Six was announced, I was hooked. I am a sucker for the jerk-asshole heroes that aren't really great guys. I don't need my heroes to slay dragons, I just need them to be memorable and hot. And Six. He was everlasting and hot as fuck. Especially with that gun in his hand. 
 Paisley just had the hottest sex of her life, a sweaty-multiple-round-of-pounding-one-night-stand sex, but she never expected the man that hit all her spots would be standing in front of her the next day with a gun pointed at her head. Or that the same man that made her body sing, would be taking her hostage and tying her to a chair in a seedy hotel. But that is just what is happening. 
 Something is amiss in the world of contract killers. Six knows this, he just doesn't have all the answers yet. But when of their crew turns up dead and others being to follow, he knows something or someone is set on taking out their little group of assassins. But figuring out who, while staying alive and dealing with a hostage proves to be anything but easy. 
 Okay so I have to say I am a big fan of dark romances. Like, give me your brutal anti-heroes and I'll show you a girl with damp panties. I really only need a spark in the character of some emotion and redemption to really see past the assholery to get over the whole, he threatens to kill her a bunch of times and maybe lets a few bullets fly just past her head to prove a point... 
 Paisley is not your typical captive heroine. After a few attempts at escape she decides to play along. She has a feeling that Six means business and so she is going to make the best of her final days. Letting her sarcastic attitude be the needed buffer in this life or death situation, she adds a bit of humor to this darker romance. And with the events of her one-night stand still fresh in her mind, she finds it hard to not be attracted to his cold-blooded killer, even if she knows it's wrong. But if she's truly going to die, why not make the best of the final days of her life, right? 
 I really liked this story. I really liked Five and I don't think I can let KI get away without writing his book, he really needs a book! But I loved that the moments that we get that showcase that Six feels something for Paisley aren't completely obvious, I love that they were tucked away moments when he did small things or acted in a completely non-ruthless-killer way. 
 I am excited for others to get their hands on this twisty story!""",2016-05-15 13:43:35,Six,romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,K.I. Lynn
688,22820059,5,"""**Refresher: Lourdes is the photographer friend of Dair that we meet in Wild Side. We got a little taste of this story at the very end of the 3rd in that series, introducing us to the start of Heath & Lourdes twisted tale.** 
 Lourdes is an early forties, recently divorced, mother of two who stumbles upon our brooding, twenty-five year old Heath. Everything about him screams danger but everything about him also screams sex. Hard. Punishing. Sex. Lourdes is left reeling as one encounter after the next leaves her needy in all the right places as Heath sneaks his way into her life and under her skin. But nothing is as it appears. For those that read The Wild Side, you know the backstory - or at least part of it - for new readers, hold on tight, because you're in for one helluva ride! 
 I love R.K. Lilley's writing. Whether it is in the form of erotic romance (as we got with the Up in the Air Series, an emotional gripping romance (as we saw with Danika & Tristan) or this. A rhythmic, erotic romance that is filled the brim with suspense and teetering on the edge of darkness. The style was so different from the prior trilogies that put her on the map, yet the talent and the flawlessness was so evident from the very start. 
 What I truly loved about his series was Lourdes. She had this confidence that we rarely see in our heroines. Sure there were slight moments of weakness, but she was not this pieced together girl verging on adulthood. She had lived a life. She had seen what the love she once held had lacked and seen the possibilities of so much more when she looked up on her friends (and yes, by friends I mean Frankie, Bianca and Danika). 
 I think what I enjoyed most about this novel was not knowing what the heck was going on or what was going to happen. I loved that none of the pieces fit until it was time for them to fall into place. There was a constant hint of what was to come in the method that Lourdes narrated her story, but yet, even with that constant foreshadowing we were left in the dark until it was time for the lights to come on. 
 Heath was this brutally damaged hero, which is one of my favorites. I loved that although it was so clear he craved more, his character stayed true. His growth was organic and not forced nor faked. It felt so natural as he shifted just slightly into what we saw towards the end of this novel. Nothing was rushed, it was paced perfectly. 
 RKL produced another off the charts hot read with story. There is no doubt that every reader is going to need a little quiet time to themselves after a few encounters with Heath. Punishing doesn't even to begin to describe the way this man took what he wanted. It was unstoppable. 
 All I can say after finishing this one is bravo~ oh, and bring us Tanner. I really want Tanner. He needs a woman to tame his wild ways!""",2015-02-18 13:20:17,The Other Man,romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,R.K. Lilley

Beautiful Ink is the story of one girl named Helen who escapes into the world and becomes another, Keller. The story pivots from present to her past as key elements unfold. 
 For Helen, life changed when she lost one family only to be thrust upon another. She had Holden and as long as she had him it would okay. They could escape this life, but Hold can't escape what is expected to be his one day. As the son of the club President, Hold knows his place and he's know that the little girl that holds his hand while he sleeps will be the one he wants at his side. 
 For Keller, life on the run gets tiring. She knows that she's tempting fate by staying too long and for working at the tattoo shop, but after walking away from everything else in her life, she can't leave the ink, the art behind. She thought she was being safe and smart, but when she meets Vin everything begins to change. Everything about her life has been lies and secrets since she made her escape. But Vin sees more than anyone before and for the first time Keller is tempted to bare her soul, even if it could end up killing them both. 
 While reading this I felt like I was reading two different stories, I didn't want to Keller's past to be those glimpses we saw of Helen. I wanted more for her, I wanted her to be able to grab hold of Vin and ride off into the sunset. But it wasn't all about Vin. I wanted Hold to get what he wanted, just not at the expense of Helen (or Keller). 
 I have enjoyed the prior books from this author and always find myself easily drawn into the story she creates. There is an ease to the feel of it. The way the characters latch on without you even realizing it. There wasn't a major surprise to the twist of the story for me, but it took absolutely nothing away from the story for me. I think most of the surprises that really made this book came from Hold. I could not help but fall in love with this character. I don't care what he did, he was all kinds of fucked up and perfect. 
 The only thing that kept this from being a five star was that the ending just missed the mark for me. I wanted some type of epilogue or event he final scenes to be drawn out a little bit longer. The ending just felt a little abrupt and I wasn't ready to stop reading. 
 I am a fan of biker books and although this story does feature a MC, I loved the different spin of the typical MC read. I am looking forward to the next book, hoping it is the story I think it might be!""",2014-04-16 13:59:03,"Beautiful Ink (Forever Inked, #1)",romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Nicole Reed

Julia is attempting to retain as much control over her life as possible, knowing that there is not much she could deny this man. A year is what she wanted, time to see if he could stay faithful, if he could remain in love with her and if she could really match his sexual desires. Brad didn't expect to fall in love with her, but now that he is, there isn't anything to he wouldn't do to ensure her safety. But his family threats are just part of the risk that Julia is taking when she decided to give this man her heart. Loving him, if he every betrayed her would crush her, but marrying him could cost her her life. 
 Alessandra Torre delivers a spectacular series with these three stories and although the focus of EOTI strays from the sensual side of their coupling to new twists & turns, when we get the sex we get the toe curling kind. There was pure beauty in the way some of these scenes were written. When Julia and Brad came together, the sex wasn't just sex. It was an joining of two souls, well on some occasions, two souls and a stranger. 
 This is one of those authors that when you pick up that first book you instantly buy everything else they've written. As you start to read through the books you then question why it took you so long to read it. When I started this book, I knew I was going to enjoy it. I did not expect that I'd want to drag out the experience of reading it though. I was not ready for it to be over with and found myself slowly consuming every word in the hopes of prolonging the experience. 
 We are given a link to a bonus chapter that expands the epilogue a bit which was a nice bonus, but I truly loved how this story concluded. The final few lines of this book gave us a glimpse into Brad De Luca, the man that we couldn't help but fall in love with but a man that gave off red flags at every turn. These last few lines not only brought the story to its end but gave us the certainty of just what kind of a man he is.""",2014-02-28 13:56:55,"End of the Innocence (Innocence, #3)",romance;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Alessandra Torre

We get the hot tattoo guy(s), a touch of alpha male, some light BDSM, a bit of a three-way love affair sparking, some suspense.... I had a hard time focusing on this one. 
 I had really high hopes and that might have been the downfall for me with this read.

The series follows Karigan as she traverses across Sacoridia as one of the King's Green Riders, couriers of the Kings most important messages and letters. Gifted with the ability to disappear through time and space, she saves the King and Sacoridia numerous times with both skill and ingenuity as we as readers learn more about this strange land. 
 Britain does a fantastic job building this world, and as the series progresses she peels more and more layers back, revealing a land long torn apart by the various races that call it home. 
 Lovers of the Song of Ice and Fire will enjoy the political intrigue that is interlaced with magic and mystery. These novels do a good job balancing love plotlines and magic, with neither outweighing the other. While some of the scenes almost tend to weigh in on cheesy, with many of the characters painfully falling on the ""too perfect"" side of the spectrum, none of which having any endearing flaws, I still find myself rooting for these characters. 
 While the first two books are amazing and keep you hooked with every page, the third and fourth books are not as successful at keeping the reader gripped to the pages. The first two books also move much faster, covering more time in much fewer pages, while for the last two books Britain uses much more descriptive detail, making most scenes rather arduous to read. While still interesting to read, the last two books tend to curb your appetite for more of Sacoridia. The next book, Mirror Sight, is schedule to be released sometime this year, and I hope Britain ""makes up for lost time"" with it, creating a much more fluid and gripping read than The High King's Tomb and Blackveil. *fingers crossed*

 I can't talk too much about it without giving away spoilers, so forgive me for being vague. 
 This book did a fantastic job on making me like a lot of the characters that I'd been a bit iffy about before. I'd been rather neutral about Connor for some time, but now I really like him.

 I think the only downfall was Risa. Throughout the series she has remained a somewhat flat character, and unfortunately, she stayed rather flat.

700,186074,3,"""You know, I have heard so much wonderful hype about this book, that I did have really high expectations. Because of that, I think I was a tad bit disappointed. 
 I will say that this book was still good, it definitely had its issues, which kept it from being the perfect book that everyone led me to believe. 
 The good; 
 Rothfuss has a nice writing style. It wasn't nearly as flawlessly beautiful as everyone kept saying, but it was a good style. It was a page-turner, because of the good writing. 
 Kvothe was a compelling character. The first two hundred to three hundred pages did a lot to make you rather emotionally attached to him. 
 A lot of the other characters, such as Denna, Devi, Elorian, and Auri (I'm probably getting some of their names wrong), were really unique. 
 It was really cool to see Kvothe's version of his story, as compared to the stories people were telling about him. It was cool finding out that there was some truth to the stories, but for the most part, those stories were wildly dramatized. I really liked a certain scene, where Kvothe had told his side of the story, and then you heard some of the people in the inn telling the same story, except how they heard it - and their versions were way more extreme and intense than Kvothe's version. 
 The take on magic was interesting. I'm still a bit confused about it, but it was a nice spin on magic. It was different. I'm actually not sure if I do put this in good or bad, because on one hand, it was nice that it was different, but on the other, I still don't really get how it worked. 
 The bad; 
 Kvothe, despite being likable, is a huge Gary Stu. He's a fantastic musician, and singer. He's incredibly smart, dedicated, and witty. He's good at pretty much everything he does. Yes, he is also arrogant and prideful, so he does have his flaws, but he definitely ranked as a Gary Stu. 
 A lot of the characters were forgettable. I know that Simm and Wilm (or whatever their names are) were supposed to be his best friends, but I found them rather boring. And a lot of the other University students and teachers didn't stand out much and it was easy to get them confused. 
 It was incredibly slow. Not much happened for a huge majority of the book. A good two hundred pages (or maybe even three hundred, I'm not sure) encompassed Kvothe's time at the University, and it got very, very slow. Not much happened at all. I found myself not wanting to read it, and struggling through it, because nothing was really happening. I would have liked more than just Kvothe being poor, singing, and studying. 
 I would have liked a bit more world-building. At times it got confusing, because it is a fantasy world, however, there are characters who don't believe in Sympathy (the magic of this world). It took a while to eventually figure out that Sympathy was sort of hush-hush, I guess. I'm probably still not getting that correct. And it also took until the end of the book to get some better understanding on demons in this world. Really, it was hard to tell what actually did exist in this fantasy world (pseudo magic, yes; demons and dragons, not so sure about). I think, in some extent, it's supposed to be a bit like our world during the Medieval times, at least to some people. So it's not high fantasy, I guess, though I thought it was. I don't know. 
 Overall, I'm a tad bit conflicted by this book. I did like it. I do want to know more. But I did take a break from this book to read another book. I did force myself to read it, and I struggled through it.

 I was hooked from the first chapter. It opens up just so wonderfully. I immediately liked Ed. I loved the dialogue in that first chapter, just for Marv having an argument with a man pointing a gun at him. It was wonderful. 
 From there it just got awesome. 
 Ed is one of the few MCs that I have genuinely enjoyed. He's nineteen, but he sort of has this more mature feel to him. Yet he'll do something that makes you remember he is only nineteen. He's witty, snarky, and smart. He's got a good heart. I really enjoyed reading about him and getting to be in his head. I liked the way he thought. 
 His messages are just so up-lifting. This really is a feel good book. Some of the messages definitely touched me. They were just simple little things, but they were wonderful. 
 It was just great to have a book that's not about the world ending or anything. It's just about a guy decoding messages he's sent and doing things to help people. 
 At times it did get a little slow, especially with the sports in the middle, but it really didn't affect the read that much. 
 Just the whole message behind this was great. There is some character in here that everyone will connect with, even just a little bit. For me, it was Ritchie. 
 Just overall, very well done. I can say so many wonderful things about this story, but I don't want to delve into it too much and spoil the fun for those who haven't read it.

I was nervous. Miller surprised me with this one though, it was not as bad as I was expecting. Still, I could see how his writing from here can slowly descend into madness. 
 That aside, this was pretty good. A lot of it was actually centered around Gordon, over Batman. It really established how messed up Gotham was before Bruce Wayne returned and became Batman. It established how Batman eventually befriended Gordon and became the crime-fighter he is. 
 I'm slightly annoyed by Selina Kyle being a prostitute/dominatrix. I feel like that is Miller being sexist and misogynistic... Not that it matters too much, I guess. But it did still bug me. Especially considering I didn't recognize her as Selina Kyle until her name was said a few times. So that's probably my biggest beef, considering I adore Catwoman.

703,11309018,5,"""I think this might actually be one of my favorite books of this series. Yes, it was all short stories, but it was beautifully done. 
 Flanagan, to start off, is a wonderful writer. He has built some incredibly in-depth characters, all of whom I have grown very attached to. Even the horses. By eleven books in, it's been about fifteen years for the characters, and at this point, we have watched them grow so much. The chemistry between characters, especially between Will and Halt is so well done. There is action and comedy, sweet moments and sad moments, assassins and weddings. There's so much that goes on, and Flanagan handles it all beautifully. After reading some very, very intense books, it's nice to return to the Ranger's Apprentice, where I know Flanagan will always eventually lighten the mood, and keep comedy thrown in throughout the stories. 
 The Lost Stories continues on with what happened to them after the tenth book, but also goes back and tells us more about how Halt and Crowley met, way back in the day. Some characters, such as Gilan and Jenny, we get to know better, which I greatly appreciated, since Gilan is one of my favorite characters. Jenny also sky-rocketed to become one of my favorite characters. (Honestly, there's very few characters I don't like). 
 I really have nothing bad to say about this book (or the whole series) at all. Yes, it is a young adult book, but it's so wonderfully done, that I, as a college student, love it to death.

704,186074,4,"""It was a good book and really drew me in. What should be a boring story isn't 
 Kote is an innkeeper at the Whispering Inn. He is new to town (only a few years there). which causes the locals to treat him as something a bit separate. He has an assistant named Bast (who's a different species but I'm unsure what exactly) who knows his past and helps him hide. 
 Kovthe (pronounced quothe) is a man of many names, a trained assassin. He understands that names have power and, as a child, wanted to learn the name of the wind in order to control it. He is a bit arrogant and self-centered, especially at the University, but he's a humorous character. 
 Chronicle is a writer of stories and history, and is related to a duke. He's mugged by soldiers of the ongoing war on his way to find Kovthe and learn of how his past led to events that occurred two years prior. The story isn't all that interesting. BUT there is action, nd it is rich in culture and the fantastical elements of the story (and the novel) drew me in. 
 - Kovthe meets Abenthy (or Ben) while in his father's troupe. Abenthy is a true arcanist - a chemist with magic. He teaches Kovthe sciences he learned at the university, and also inherent abilities that Kovthe displays. The magic is called sympathy. 
 - He becomes a beggar in Tarbean after a horrible incident. His life is hard, but after hearing the lute and a story of the infamous Lanre (and his lady), Kovthe comes out of his depression and gets back on track to the University. On his way there, he meets ""the lady love"" of the story, Denna. 
 - Denna (Dianne, Dennah) is a woman of many names and a mysterious past. Kovthe's acceptance of barely knowing anything of her is a bit frustrating, but it is also understandable. 
 - At one point, I forgot that Kovthe was telling his story as something past until the draccus came into play. Then I remembered the scrael - a demon-type spider from the start. *shudders* 
 Tehlu is the god. Lore of him is similar to Jesus - born of a virgin, chases literal demons from people, and calls others to follow him. Life rings pain, but there is freedom in death. Pray AND believe. 
 As another reviewer said, Kovthe's lack of money is mentioned a bit too much. ""If you've never been poor...If you've never had to beg... If you've always had a fund..."" That and his arrogance are his only flaws. It's a tad annoying but not horrible. 
 One question throughout is if the Chandrians of the past (and in fictional stories) still exist. And what truly happened to Lanre? What is his story/song? 
 There is a great message of not judging people based on their circumstances and their past. You don't always know where they are coming from.""",2014-03-20 08:12:40,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 I grew up watching the anime version of Sailor Moon. I have been enjoying watching Sailor Moon Crystal and the old episodes of Sailor Moon on Hulu. When I discovered that my local library had the manga, I had to read it. 
 These books are so much fun and ridiculous. I will caution the prospective reader that the manga is a bit disjointed at times. The original anime did a much better job at character development than the manga. Even though the series is a bit silly, I can see myself rereading these books on an annual basis, because they are super easy to read and are quite enjoyable. The later volumes are a bit dark; however, for the most part, the series is fun and light. Through the power of love and friendship, evil will always be punished.

 The other thing I didn't like (and this so makes me a bad person) was the dragon rights thing. I know that if Naomi Novik never touched on this matter, I would have been frustrated, because the British dragons could be treated better.

 This wasn't a bad book at all, it just wasn't great. The writing needed improvement, it had so much telling and not nearly enough just showing by actions. 
 The leads were nice characters but I was frustrated by how ridiculous their families were and how they let them affect their lives so much. Her father was just too evil, he seemed like a charicature of a villain. It seemed unbelievable how badly everyone treated them, it was too simplistic. Eventually people were better but I had trouble believing the initial reactions. 
 The story glossed over so much then told us about it afterwards, I was not a fan of this style because I felt disconnected from the story. The romance was kind of luke warm for me, it took so long to occur then wasn't fleshed out enough. 
 So my end thoughts are that this was an okay, average western romance that needed some work on the writing but showed some promise in the author. I don't understand the intense reaction people had toward it which led to so many people saying how it was the best book evah.

713,18663972,4,"""Here's a book that blindsided me. I went in thinking it would be just about ""okay"" - and came out frothing at the mouth for the next one! Already preordered. But let me not get ahead of myself. 
 Deviana Morris is a gun-toting mercenary, with a hankering for danger and blasting pirates, who is ambitious as hell. While most mercs are happy to move up the ranks until they hit a cushy office job, Devi isn't like that - she wants to be a Devastator, the most dangerous job in all of Paradox, and she'll do damn well anything to get it. 
 Which is precisely why she gets herself a job on the Glorious Fool, captained by Caldswell, which is said to be cursed. After all, the Devastators count one year on the Fool to be the equivalent of five years service elsewhere. And since mercs don't usually live for long, Devi decides to fast track her career. 
 But there are secrets aboard the Fool, ones she shouldn't stick her nose in - but pigheaded little Devi can't help but poke her nose in, endangering her life and, more importantly to her, her career. As if it wasn't complicated enough, she finds herself ridiculously infatuated with Rupert, the ship's cook - who seems to have some secrets of his own. 
 You can see why I was a little hesitant, right? Love and secrets - could be a Nora Roberts novel in space. Except, it's not. Devi is a believable character - hardened from years as a merc, ambitious as anything, who answers violence with violence and puts her career before anything. She has never dated - only slept with casually - men before, so her reaction to Rupert's soft kindness is understandable. 
 It's also not as if she falls heads over and becomes reliant on him as a character - not at all! She feels like an idiot for her feelings, and she takes what she wants, whether it gets her into trouble at all. 
 I really loved Devi, but Bach's secondary characters are colourful too - a bird navigator, who is bristly and has a superiority complex, an know-it-all alien doctor with a sense of humour and a sweet, if a bit kooky, hippy roommate. They provide a great backdrop for the novel, and I'm hoping to hear more out of them in the future novels - particular Hyrex. I loved him. 
 The mysteries come in midway through the book, and I've got some (what I think are) fairly good guesses towards them, but I'm anxious to find out. They aren't overdone, and there are plenty to sink your teeth in to. I'm particularly intrigued as to what the hell the bugs are. 
 The prose is solid - nothing to write home about, but it does the job, moving the story about. The plot does meander in places, but it's a nice break from the sometime relentless action in others. 
 Like I said, I'm pumped that the next two books are both coming out this year, and can't wait to find out where Bach takes us next with the crew of the Glorious Fool.

714,3235328,4,"""I picked this up based on a Goodreads recommendation and my local library had it. This is a Swedish mystery translated into English. I think that this accounts for the fact that the dialogue seems stilted at times, probably a translation issue not a writing issue. 
 If you are looking for fast paced thriller, this is not the book for you. This moves at a much more sedate and at times non-linear pace. The focus is more on the after effects of the crime over time. The central crime is the disappearance and assumed murder of a young child that occurred 20 years in the past. 
 The case is reopened with the appearance of one of the child's sandals. This brings the mother back to the ""scene of the crime"" and reunites the local people who were around at the time of the child's disappearance. Nothing is as it seems, the resolution is not what I expected and it was good to see that it was not a stereotypical child abduction/pedophile story. 
 The mother, Julia, reunites with her father in the course of investigating the new evidence. The writer did an excellent job with the depiction of loss and depression that follows in the wake of a child's disappearance. I could completely relate to Julia's issues with not being able to ""let go"" or move on from the loss of Jens. I have always imagined that having a child disappear without a trace would be worse than a situation in which you know they are dead. The not knowing would drive me mad, in Julia's case she hangs on to her sanity with the aid of drink and isolation. 
 My only criticism would be that the ending or reveal seemed somewhat abrupt, however I have since realized that this is book one in a quartet so that is maybe to be expected.""",2014-02-24 17:38:30,"Echoes from the Dead (The Öland Quartet, #1)",mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Johan Theorin;Marlaine Delargy

 More by Sloan Parker was definitely not what i expected. It was so much more... 
 Luke Moore has been running away from his politically ambitious father for 15 years, he has developed a set of rules during those years to never make himself vulnerable again, one, never fall in love, and two, never spend more than a single night with a man. Which is why the Haven sex club is the perfect place to be, he goes, he takes his pick, has sex with one or multiple partners and then leaves and forgets. But one night of life changing sex makes every rule he has ever put for himself crumble. 
 Richard and Matthew make him push his boundaries, both personally and sexually, as time progresses and feelings evolve he makes the decision to no longer hide and take his father head on. But maybe he was way over his head cause his father wont let him or anybody win. 
 Apart from those issues, the trio has to deal with a relationship that is simply moving TOO FAST -in my humble opinion-, trust, being accepted by loves ones and the world, the past, and Luke's reflex to run. 
 I drifted between them, my body on fire, their touches spot on, hitting all the right places, moving with the right speed. Had they crawled inside my goddamn head and read my mind? 
 With a few more strokes, I came. My legs trembled. It was all I could do to hold myself up. 
 Richard's hot breath blew over the base of my neck as he came. He fell forward and said, ""I didn't know--I didn't know it'd get better."" 
 I shuddered. My body needed to stop betraying me. 
 Apart from the fact that things moved along way way too fast for my liking I still enjoyed this, apart from being extremely hot and the sex scenes freaking unbelievable, the romance factor paired with the emotions was simple amazing, I was enraptured by their feelings and commitment to one another, it was great to see. Also, the doubts and personal drama that factored in this book were entertaining and didnt let me feel bored or anxious for the book to end. I was definitely satisfied with the read and I enjoyed it a lot. 
 ""For now."" I stood and paced. The realization of everything hit me like repeated strikes to a punching bag. ""He broke into your home--our home--and attacked Matthew.  This is my goddamn family, and he can't do this. I won't let him. I won't let him take anything else from me."" I stopped and stared at them. Two smiling men beamed up at me. ""What the hell are you so happy about?"" 
 Matthew laid his cheek against Richard's temple. ""Did you hear? Family."" 
 ""I did. Get over here, Luke."" 
 I sank to my knees beside the tub. Richard pulled me to him. He made love to my mouth, his hands wet and firm on each side of my face.

 I don't normally read a lot of erotica, but I got an email from Netgalley about this book as well as another one that I downloaded that I expect to read and review in the future. Just seeing the covers, I already knew they would have mature content, but I don't really know what came over me to download them, but I think this one was because of ""Sexy"" and ""Dragon."" 
 I think in terms of erotic content, it wasn't that bad for a person who doesn't read much of it. Most of the detailed scenes were in the beginning and were just mostly dirty dreams. I think there was around one or two scenes where they actually have sex that was thoroughly written. The other half of the story was about Stig and Cora's relationship, as well as some action that has nothing to do with sex. 
 Cora is deeply troubled when she crossed paths with certain awful people so she runs away to Stig's isolated home. Stig, being a dragon in mating season at that time, couldn't even begin to think how he could keep Cora in the same house. But seeing that she was really desperate, Stig allowed it. Tensions rise and secrets are revealed, and they find out that some things that shouldn't happen will happen. 
 OVERALL, this was a short and steamy read, but it also deals with romance in the emotional sense and how they are deeply attracted to each other. I think that's why I liked it. It was pretty sweet. The part I really liked though is how Stig is a dragon, and Lolita Lopez writes about his world and his abilities. She also mentions why knights are hunting down all the dragons and why dragons shapeshift. I think it was very interesting.

It wasn't just subjugation and hatred, it was very well thought-out subjugation and hatred. I can't imagine how Trevor Noah and his incredibly strong-willed and amazing mother lived through it, especially since he was born mixed race. Which meant he didn't belong anywhere and was technically illegal. 
 You'd think this would be a sad story but it's an incredibly uplifting story. Especially entering into dark times now, it's nice to see that even in the worse of times one can make the most of life. For Trevor and his family, it almost seems like they didn't know anything else, so of course they wouldn't spend much time moping about it. They just worked hard, found all the loopholes, and fought the system whenever and wherever they could. Did I mention, his mother is truly incredible? 
 The book is basically a memoir, but written in episodic chapters, each one telling a poignant or funny story about growing up. It's not entirely chronological, and it doesn't cover Trevor's rise as a comedian. I would love to read a sequel where he talks about that, especially what it's like to move to the US where he'd automatically be seen as an African American instead of a mixed race South African. 
 In story after story, Trevor uses humor to dissect the concept of race, to show that it is really just a social construct. I really enjoyed reading these stories, as they are very relatable and charming.

 While I loved Working It (the first book in the series) and I loved catching up with Zack and Nolan in this book, unfortunately, I can't say the same about Faking It. 
 I loved Max, I thought he was an amazing character, strong and reliable. He wanted to find that special someone, thinking Grady might be it for him. I didn't quite like Grady, though. I found him to be an adorable drunk at first, but when he came up with the whole fake relationship idea and started to show who he really was, that changed. I couldn't relate with him at all and even when he showed some signs of growing up near the end of the book, I was way past caring about him by then. He was a poor little rich boy who liked rebelling against his father, but still lived off his money. He didn't work, didn't do anything worthwhile, yet, Max defended him against both Justin and Grady's father? I'm sorry, but that didn't quite work out for me. Despite the fact that Max and Grady were obviously attracted physically to each other and that they were great and very hot in bed, I couldn't see the appeal for Grady. *shrugs*

And if you don't think that Dante's attitude is funny, my only response is: 
 And since we are talking about Dante, I need to say that he is a cocky, conceited, flamboyant, self-superior anti-hero that thinks he is the sexiest guy on earth. So if you don't like characters like him, you won't enjoy this book much. 
 But Dante does grow into a better person throughout the novel. There was always good in him, of course, but the events and people he meets in during the story help that good part of him become more obvious and apparent. Sure, he is still conceited at the end of the story, but his development as a character is exponential. 
 Charlie, the female lead of the story, is also a character that I loved a heck of a lot. She's awkward, names cars, keeps a bag of Skittles in her pocket, is insecure, and has a really loving heart. I couldn't help but love her. The girl is one of those impossibly nice characters that are also realistic in their very own way. 
 The dynamics between the main characters and the side characters is what made the book for me. Every interaction Dante and Charlie had with Max, Blue, Valery, Annabell, and Gram pulled me into the story more. Victoria Scott really did good with this aspect of the book. 
 I do think that the first part of the novel was much better than the second. It was more fulfilling even though the Boss Man vs. Big Guy plot didn't fully kick in yet. Not that the second part was not entertaining, it was definitely entertaining, but I just believe that the first part was more... tightly written. 
 Final Verdict: The Collector is a pretty awesome book with great characters, humor, and writing. It's just that not very awesome second part that bothered me. I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining story.

 I thought this was going to be a great book with all the great reviews I've been seeing? I was fooooooled! 
 BR with JAnne,Sarah,Jessica and Heather... 
 Emma is 29yrs old and goes with her friend to pierce her tongue. 
 Before we know it, she falls on her face and is talked into a tatoo by this 'hunk' Luke. 
 Someone whose calls a woman sugar sounds scaly to me! 
 Her sister calls and Emma goes over the her sister stalks her husband in his car because she thinks his cheating. So she sits on the flow playing angry birds.-----> what significance does this have to the book? Nothing?! 
 ""The big difference? She's tiny and I'm a size twelve. On a good day, that is. On bad days, like bloated period days, or days when I've decided that chocolate is calling my name nonstop, which, let's face it, is most days, then I'm more of a fourteen. Not that I'm fat, but since the images that society forces down our throats these days tell us that if you aren't built like a stick with boobs (bee sting size), then you are not skinny, but I am a healthy kind of curvy. I've always said that I was just born in the wrong century, cause back then? I would have been the shit!"" 
 Emma's friend tears her tongue and they go back to the parlor and Luke asks Emma to dinner - oh wait he didnt ask----> He TOLD her she's having dinner with him. 
 Emma is practically a pig at dinner making moans about the food. She keeps silently praying her doesn't want to share dessert? ----> eeehhh WTF?! 
 ""I forked up a bite of my (what else?) fettuccini alfredo with grilled chicken and groaned uncontrollably with appreciation at the perfect harmony of creamy, cheesy sauce, succulent , juicy chicken, and firm but oh, so tender pasta. Chewing slowly, my gaze met Luke's as he stared at me hungrily."" 
 ""Want to try a bite?"" I asked him, hoping that he'd say no. What? I told you I was greedy with my Manny's..."" 
 ""The waiter arrived with my dessert then and I wasted no time grabbing my fork and digging in. Scooping up a hefty bite, I wrapped my lips around it, unable to stop the uncontrollable moan of ecstasy from escaping my throat as I chewed slowly."" 
 ""I blinked and asked sheepishly, ""Want some?"" (Again hoping that he'd say no)"" 
 Who eats like a pig on the first date? 
 Then they go to her house and make out until her siblings walk in on them. 
 ""As Luke's hand smoothed my hair back from my face again, I rolled my head forward and bit into Luke's thigh through his jeans."" 
 ""My cha-chi was quivering with excitement, screaming, 'Hallelujah, the desert days are over, girl! Bring on the rain!' 
 Few days later- Luke calls Emma to TELL her again his coming to fetch her despite her having plans with her best friend- then says his cancelling it---->eeeeh when did they get buddy buddy? 
 ""He cut me off mid-sentence. ""Babe. I'll call Allie. Six. Be ready. Later, sugar."""" 
 Emma goes home thinking she's having a girl fat pigging out night with her friend 
 ""I pulled my hair up into a messy knot on the very top of my head and washed my makeup off before heading into the kitchen to start dragging out the makings for English muffin pizzas, me and Allie's favorite childhood meal. I also pulled out the ingredients for Dried Beef Dip, bags of chips, stuff to make s'mores, and checked to make sure I had everything for our ""Special Sundaes"" which consisted of strawberry frozen yogurt (or ice cream) with strawberry daiquiri wine cooler poured over it. Delish!"" 
 Luke comes--->then she acts surprised? HE TOLD HER!! 
 They make loads of Food for the Obese. 
 Emma pigs out again and they make out. 
 Hot words from the tat boy about sex and it was over before I could even say ORGASM...

 ""Mommy made me pamcakes (how cute is she?) wif' syrup!"" She giggled gleefully"" 
 ""Rubbing my arm (it stung !) I replied, ""What are you, five? Cheese and rice, man!"" 
 ""Looking back, that had to have been the most embarrassing moment of my life. Allie was rushing me to get to the lake so we could swim with Alec Holt and Brad Sumner. I had walked out of the bunkroom in my swimsuit, ready to go. Allie and our counselor were standing in the living room of the cabin, and they had frozen, mouths open, gaping at me in shock. The counselor had turned without a word and walked into her room for a second before returning and handing me a pair of nail scissors. She then had pointed to the scissors, pointed to my thighs, and pointed toward the bathroom. Even at thirteen I got the hint, and never looked back. Bushzilla had never returned."" 
 ""I loved the pizza rolls at Griff's. They weren't like the pizza rolls you buy at the store or anything.

I always had a hard time deciding between those and the tater poppers, which are these little shredded potato bundles that are filled with a mixture of cream cheese and jalapenos and then deep fried. Yum""------> AGAIN WITH THE FOOD!!! 
 ""The waitress came over (she must have been new, because I didn't know her) to take their orders, and they both looked over to each of us and asked if we wanted anything""----> WHO CARES????!!

 Mr Noah shared these stories from his childhood which will astound and move the reader. His story is often horrific. The title sets the story from the beginning because Mr Noah was born to a Caucasian European man and a black African woman. During Apartheid. His birth was a crime. And his childhood was as terrible as you would expect. It was also far more wonderful than you would expect thanks in large part to a strong, funny, kind and loving mother. She is a force and she propelled him forward. His love for her is palpable in these stories. The reader goes away from it marveling at her spirit.

 This was the first kind of YA splatter thriller (idk what the genre is called exactly) that I read so I don't really have something to compare it to. I watched a couple of movies like this but maybe it was more like horror, I'm not really sure. 
 ANYWAY I didn't hate it and I didn't love it. I actually really liked the first 40-50% and then both real life got in the way and I got a little bored of the book. Don't get me wrong, the book is really easy to read even when you're bored with it. The last 25% is easily skimmable even if you're a slow reader like me. 
 I actually found it the perfect book to read casually, when you can only read a few pages at the time or you're distracted or you're for example in between two delayed flights (speaking from experience), especially the second half. 
 It wasn't too scary but until the murderer is revealed it was kind of too creepy for me to read it at night. 
 Something I really liked were the characters. They were well fleshed out and they had distinct personalities, even the ones who were just introduced briefly. The cast was also diverse with a black protagonist and a trans side character. 
 Many reviewers didn't like the reason for the killings but I found it made more sense (in the killer's twisted way of thinking) than what the gang originally thought was the motive. 
 I didn't particularly like the ending because I didn't find it suspenseful enough, and the writing seemed just off in some sentences. I don't know if it's because I had an early copy, but it was still okay overall. 
 Probably not the read of a lifetime but still enjoyable in the right mood.""",2017-07-31 12:52:18,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins
732,31213312,2,"""I liked Brayden's Soho Loft series enough that I thought I'd branch out and see how it goes. So far, the answer is not terribly well. This book has an unfortunate prologue that takes place in the present where you see Margaret (Maggie) be really, really cold to Courtney. And then it goes back in time to them meeting. In high school. 
 The rest of the book is broken up into ""Summers"" that consist of us seeing their relationship blossom into this really beautiful thing that sustains both of them even though they are very different people. And the whole time I'm wondering what Courtney does to earn that prologue and really, really hating that the prologue made me expect that. And the problems this caused are all spoilers. 
 The thing is that as I'm reading it becomes increasingly clear that Courtney is madly, deeply in love with Maggie and I cannot imagine anything that would induce Courtney to hurt her. Seriously, Courtney was a goner and practically radiated constancy and courage. So I wondered what would happen and the answer is that their rift was entirely Maggie's fault! Once that happened and we get to the present with maybe a third of the book left and I'm wondering when Maggie is going to pull her head out and start repairing damage. And the answer is that Maggie is a moron and I hate her. She swoons about with a poor me litany when she is the cause of her own problems absolutely 100%. She continues to hurt Courtney over and over again until the very end when she finally makes a choice and then gets everything her own way, anyway. 
 I can't help feeling that Brayden expected us to identify with Maggie but I can't see any reason why that would be so. She's fearful and stubborn and self-pitying and I spent the last quarter of the book wishing Courtney would find someone nice to fall in love with and start healing her broken heart.  
 So yeah, this didn't turn out well. And that makes me sad because I really liked Courtney and wanted her story to be a good one. 
 A note about Audible: Paige McKinney was an awful narrator for this story. Her reading for Maggie was this juvenile chirp that made it hard for me to take her seriously, even when Maggie was a teen. She does slightly better with Courtney, but only in contrast. Also, the intonation was flat to the point of emotionlessness and that made both characters seem shallower than they are written. I had to constantly reinflate the dialogue to take the emotions and characters seriously, and that's on top of the problems I already had in the spoiler above. 
 A note about Steamy: There are three or four explicit sex scenes, but it feels like fewer because the timeline is so stretched out. So this is the middle of my steam tolerance. It didn't help that the stuff in the spoiler made me distance from the two of them so the later scenes were more of a drag than an enhancement of the story.""",2017-10-16 14:09:42,Strawberry Summer,romance;young-adult;fiction,Melissa Brayden

He spends the entire story slicing into Laney in thousands of tiny cuts and while she doesn't just take it, he never, ever, walks it back or apologizes or gives even a hint of reform. Well, there's a grand gesture at the end, of course, but it was weak and depended on Laney being the nice girl still. I really wanted her to push his face in the whole book and kept going only because Laney was fun and I enjoyed the battle of the hair dressers. Really, Laney is a hoot and the only thing that connected me to the story at all. Oh, and did all the parents have to suck? And I can't help feeling like Gibson wants me to like this small town even though it's full of awful people being jerks.

734,676924,3,"""A decent second showing in the series, this book picks up where the first left off. Zoey is now the popular girl on campus, or at least the new leader of the elite clique, the ""Dark Daughters"". The strengths of the first book are still present here, though there are some new weaknesses I'm not a fan of. 
 I liked that the authors weren't coy with the Neferet storyline. There were some hints in the first book that all was not well with the current high priestess and that becomes a strong aspect of the main plot of this book. I half expected this to drag out another couple of books before we got anything definitive about Neferet and I was glad we were brought into the fold sooner rather than later. 
 I also liked that the core friendships Zoey formed in the last book held up in this one, too. Her friends are a strong part of the changes Zoey wants to make and they really step up rather than being eclipsed by Zoey's rising star. 
 I didn't like that Zoey takes a step backwards, maturity-wise, in her relationships. And sadly, yes, that is plural. Maybe it's just because I prefer Erik so much, but the whole messing around with Heath is, to me, nearly incomprehensible. And adding a guy on top of that is just overkill. I've never had much patience with sappy poets, so it's no surprise that I'm not happy with Zoey being drawn to Lauren and those scenes were almost painfully hokey, to me. 
 Since the romancy drama was a big(ish) part of the story, they made Zoey seem a lot younger than she is supposed to be. At 17, she should have more of a handle on what she likes and doesn't like about guys (and these guys are all very different) and she has a pack of friends to help her work things out, as well. Indeed, the fact that she keeps so much of the guy stuff from her friends seems like a huge contradiction in her character and one I really didn't care for. 
 As a result of the romance fails, I'm very close to giving this one just two stars. Fortunately, the actual plot makes up for some of that, particularly the parts with Zoey and Aphrodite--enough to push this to three stars, but only just.""",2012-05-02 15:18:38,"Betrayed (House of Night, #2)",romance;fiction;young-adult;fantasy;paranormal,P.C.

This part of the anime really encapsulates why the manga is so much better: no forced tension by having Mamoru dump Usagi for REASONS. The Mamoru of the manga is a more complicated and interesting character, with more powers than the ability to throw a damn rose. When he sees visions of the crumbling future, he does pull back from Usagi, but mostly because he fears he's not strong enough to support her. Yes, he pulls back. And yes, Usagi's jealousy of Chibi-Usa creates some additional strain, but they stay together and eventually resolve their problems over the course of the arc. 
 Not so in the anime! Instead of trusting Usagi he just lies to her, claiming he no longer loves her and believes her to be weak. GAH!

 I could definitely relate to Eilis's ""fish-out-of-water"" story. And overall, I gave the high star rating because there were many things about moving to a new city that I could relate to. Plus, the ending felt really satisfying for me. 
 There was not as much conflict as their could have been (or the author decided to downplay any potential conflict), I found the narrative moved quickly and keep my interest. For example: 
 Conflict: Eilis's family decides she should move to America because she's got nothing going for her in Ireland. 
 Resolution: Eilis goes to America--she does not protest this decision. 
 _________ 
 Conflict: In the first major action scene, Eilis suffers from seasickness in her bunk on the ship to America. 
 Resolution: Her bunk mate takes care of her and at the end of the journey gives her some makeup. Eilis accepts this care from a relative stranger. 
 _________ 
 Conflict: Eilis is home sick. 
 Resolution: Father Flood (her sponsor for helping her get settled in Brooklyn) registers her for accounting classes and pays for the tuition. 
 _________ 
 Conflict: Eilis gets the big bedroom in the basement of her boarding house and her roommates are mad at her. 
 Resolution: They are snarky at first, but then leave her alone. 
 _________ 
 I feel like I could go on and on about the conflicts Eilis is presented with and how they continually fell flat for me. Eilis is very passive in all the action that happens around her. I find that to be the most frustrating part about reading this book. How can Eilis just sit back and accept the things that are happening around her? How can she not defend herself? How does she not know if she's falling in love?

739,186074,3,"""There's something about Name of the Wind that I just can't figure out that gives me hesitation in giving it a 4 Star rating. I'd say my review is 3.5 out of 5 Stars. (see my original review here) 
 There's nothing inherently wrong with the book. Kvothe (pronounced ""Quothe"") is telling his life story to and old man called The Chronicler and his companion Bast (I think he's a demon, but it's not entirely clear). Kvothe, ""The Kingkiller,"" has made a name for himself within the land as a person of magnificent power. But when the Chronicler finds Kvothe, he has disguised himself as an Innkeeper in a small town. As the first book in the series, we only get one day's worth of information about Kvothe's life from his young years with his parents, traveling actors and musicians, to when they died, his subsequent feelings of grief, growing up as an orphan in the streets of a large city, and his time at the University for Magic, (magic is also called Sympathy in this world), The Arcanum. 
 This is what the book is about, there are interludes in between the story where Kvothe, Bast, and The Chronicler break for meals or interruptions at the Inn, but otherwise readers get an uninterrupted view of Kvothe's life. The storytelling is very interesting. It reminds me of how stories used to be told orally, but with the grace of a writer. Prose-y that includes the fluff of a storyteller who wants to make it a good story. At some points I wonder if Kvothe is telling the truth or possibly exaggerating. 
 One of the reasons I don't want to give this a glowing review was because of the character of Kvothe himself. He is exceptionally gifted in seemingly every thing he tries to the point where I found him unrelatable. His life sucks. From the time his parents die to the time he enters the University (and then some) he is constantly fighting for survival in the streets, grieving, or just purposefully getting himself into trouble. I get that this adds conflict, but it doesn't add to the over all story. (Oh, there's a plot? Why, yes, there is!). He's unrelatable because he doesn't face a lot of challenges in learning sympathy--he makes some dumb choices, but in terms of mastering the art of sympathy, he's leagues ahead of everyone else and I find that extremely hard to believe. Everything comes too easily. 
 Kvothe is motivated to go to the University because if he can find more information from the Archives about the people/ creatures/ demons called The Chandrian (which according to that society is just a bunch of myths and there's no real proof of any of them, but Kvothe had seen them after they killed his parents and their troupe of actors, and The Chandrian had let him live) he'll be able to get revenge for his family. The only headway we make into this plot is the last 1/4 of the novel, where Kvothe has been through a few semesters worth of school, met a beautiful woman, and then hears about a Chandrian-like mass murder. He travels to the town by taking out an enormous debt finds a tid-bit of information, saves a girl --but doesn't ""get"" her, and we're left hanging with the promise of the next day and the next story. 
 I felt like I had to re-tell what The Name of the Wind is about because the back cover and the synopsis provided above barely scratches the surface about what is happening in this novel. They are so focused on the overall story that this one becomes a sort of look at what happens next type of deal. And maybe that was my biggest problem--the things that were in the synopsis didn't happen in this book. He only told his story up to the time in the Arcanum and he could have summed up more about his childhood to get to the search for The Chandrian. One of the positives of this type of storytelling is that we do get an in-depth look at the world that Kvothe lives in, from the student loan debt, to the magic, and monsters. It's an interesting place to be. 
 I do want to read the next book in the series, The Wise Man's Fear, and hopefully I won't have mixed feelings about it.""",2014-02-10 21:34:38,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 But then I started reading past the first few pages. Kvothe has somehow evolved into this beaten-down innkeeper, who is so the antithesis of this super duper warrior he's just told us he is that I felt pity for his mundane life and read on. 
 So then Kvothe tells us his life story, in the guise of actually telling a story to a travelling writer, so we get hella detail and Kvothe's thoughts of his life. This story goes back to the start of his life, so when Kvothe was a child-stuck-up-prick, but you kinda can't hate him cos he was a child. And then, by being bright in general and getting lucky and thinking on his feet (and also being a bit of a dodgy guy) he does some amazing stuff in the duration of the book. 
 It is literally never boring. And I just love that while everything is happening, death and rape and incest and everything everyone loves so much in other popular fantasy books (!), Kvothe has very serious views, such as he is vehemently against being the kind of man that touches a woman without her permission, his father tells him 'never call a whore a whore, call them a lady, their lives are hard enough' kind of thing.

I figured it was England just from some of the slang, but the accent got so think I finally realized it was Australia, then double checked with the book jacket. 
 The main character is strong, the secondary characters interesting, but the story was a bit of a stretch. At the end I was frustrated with the whole thing, but kept reading because I had to know what happened to the characters. I really disliked the ending. It wrapped up neatly, but without really explaining anything. 
 SPOILER: When the strange man said, something like 'I killed your father' in his list of all the things he had a hand in I totally lost all respect for the book. It's at that point a normal person would have stopped listening to the neat little plot wrap-up and reacted with his gut. But the line was passed over and the story finished with a fizzle.

746,186074,5,"""I was a little skeptical about reading this book because the last thick fantasy I read let me down. Not so with this book. 
 The writing style was clever. It opened with Kote (Kvothe) as the main character, but it quickly turned to him narrating his past. I connected with Kvothe right away because as a young child, he was a part of troupe of travelling players. Moving around was in his blood, so to speak. Just as it is in mine. And I must say, his voice was fantastic, in the literal sense. It didn't take long for me to stop gauging my progress in the book and get caught up in the story. I didn't want it to end. But alas, as all stories must, end it did. 
 Another aspect of the book I appreciated was the way it compared legends to truth and superstition to intellect. The peoples in this book have so many different beliefs that it felt like a real world. Rothfuss also takes what readers might expect of fantasy and turns it on its head. 
 For example, you expect a fire-breathing dragon? That's not exactly what you get. Instead, there's this really cool tree-eating, fire breathing lizard. 
 Some stories may not be as fantastical as they are made out to be. That's not to say that readers must be disenchanted. There's still plenty of magic and mystery, what with sympathy, the names of nature, and creatures of the Fae. It just goes to show that sometimes even the magical is not quite what we expected. 
 Then there's the emphasis on names. They hold power in the world, but not necessarily the power present in other fantasy novels. 
 ""Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts."" 
 Another play on expectations is the opening and ending pages. You expect one thing from the beginning of the story and get something completely different. It's rather heartbreaking. But I really want to know how it all turns out. 
 I gave The Name of the Wind 5/5 stars for excellent narration and realistic yet fantastic plot. There wasn't a dull page among them all. I would recommend this book to readers of fantasy and those who like a nice, thick book.""",2016-03-01 12:03:49,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
747,18690890,5,"""I absolutely loved Paper Towns. It reminds me of looking for Alaska - another John Green book that struck me and that I remembered for such a long time. I especially loved the intertextuality and the novel is really inspiring. Whitman's poetry is inspiring but Emily Dickinson's quote ""forever is composed of nows"" made me stop reading and overthink the novel - and life on it's own. 
 Quentin's search for Margo is great, you can feel the despiration to find the girl that he always loved so much, but you can also feel his opinion changing throughout his search. It struck me, because people are so different to different audiences, and so is Margo. Her life is a stage and while playing, she decided she could not handle it anymore. 
 My favorite part was the road trip to Agloe. The idea of the fictional town struck me. The protagonist and his friends have so much fun during their road trip, finally they have a clue, but in the end, some clues were not intended to be clues. Finding Margo is the goal for their road trip, but the trip becomes the main goal. Paper Towns taught me that ""life is a journey, not a destination"" (Emerson). This fits with the intertextuality again, this novel seems to be inspired on being on the road - trying to find the one thing you are looking for, but it reminds me not to overlook life in the meantime. 
 Paper Towns is a new favorite for me. It feels like so much more than just a novel - it feels like a lesson to be learned.""",2015-02-06 14:04:24,Paper Towns,young-adult;fiction;romance;mystery;thriller;crime,John Green

 I was approved for a review copy of The Body Electric at NetGalley -thank you!- in exchange for an honest review. My review is written in my own opinion and is uninfluenced by anyone. 
 That was one of the most confusing things I've ever read. I need a minute to get my thoughts into order. Clearly, I'm not cut out for science-fiction. 
 The plot was okay. Not absolutely brilliant, but not entirely solid either. For the most part, my brain was running around in circles trying to get a sense of what the heck was going on, instead of happily imagining how the story was playing out in my mind. Honestly, if I were to visualize anything right now, it's the image of my brain frantically running all over the place. And that's certainly not a good thing. 
 Because the plotline of The Body Electric felt like it was all over the place! I could understand where the plot was going, but the facts and information were simply blasted at my slow reader mind at different intervals. It could be a good story if not for the confusion, because the premise was interesting and seemed to be something I could truly enjoy reading.""",2014-12-12 17:10:59,The Body Electric,young-adult;fiction;romance;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Beth Revis

 I don't know what I hate more -- his fixation on some kind of stereotypical hypermasculinity, the bullfighting, his misogyny, how horribly he treated Hadley -- but I spent the entire book wanting to reach through the book and shake him.

752,363391,3,"""Ugh, this one was a dud. Just, a silly, silly premise. And worse, a silly premise that isn't backed up by anything substantial at all. Just empty jokes and no stakes. I mean, literally it starts with a joke (horses that are acting weird, and that are secretly Controllers, and why???) and ends with a joke (all of this over an Andalite toilet !) It's all harmless enough, but compared with the best books in this series, it's just not satisfying at all. 
 And it has Cassie as a narrator because she likes horses??? I don't know, guys. It's just sort of inevitable that a series with 56+ books in it is going to have some stinkers in it. 
 I'm honestly not sure what else to say about this book. The best part about it was a series of pop culture jokes that are completely dated now. I happen to think it's hilarious that the pseudonyms the kids chose while breaking in to a thinly veiled Area 51 stand-in were Fox Mulder, Dana Scully and Cindy Crawford (Cassie panicked), but I can't imagine anyone not born within a very specific window of time appreciating the joke. 
 All in all, classic filler. Not offensive or anything, or poorly written, just sort of pointless.

753,363392,3,"""I remember loving The Forgotten when I was a kid, but it really is pretty useless in the grand scheme of things, other than to establish that time-travel is a thing (this is achieved by falling through a Sario Rip, literally a hole in space-time, as the Andalites call them). That lazy genre classic, the Reset Button, shows up here and shows up hard. By the end, no one but Jake even remembers most of the events in the book. 
 Actually, most of the time-travel stuff in this is pseudo-science nonsense. Time-travel is hard to get right in the first place, but here it just felt like it was trying too hard, reaching for answers that didn't quite work, and that were for the most part way too convenient. A lot of the book felt like that, just off, like Applegate was out of ideas. 
 Imagine my surprise when I clicked over to Hirac Delest only to be informed that K.A. Applegate had a bit of a creative crisis in the midst of writing this, and panicked that she was out of ideas for the series. It really does show in the writing. Jake makes a series of really dumb choices, doubling down on those choices and refusing to communicate, and lets his impulses get in the way. More importantly, there doesn't actually seem to be a reason for him to have made these mistakes. They're just there, and not born out of some flaw he needs to correct or lesson he needs to learn. Just like the story of the Animorphs being lost in the Amazon, his arc is ultimately pointless. (There is some effort towards having Jake struggle with being a leader, but it doesn't really go anywhere.)

754,17345218,4,"""SPOILERS AHOY. Just this whole thing. Don't even read it. Unless you don't care about being spoiled about something that was in the news and people freaked out about on Twitter and also you learn in the very first paragraph of the book. In that case, welcome, dear friend. 
 When I say that I was sad about the news that Helen Fielding would be killing Mark Darcy in her third Bridget Jones book, I am practicing the rhetorical technique known as litotes, which is fancy asshole for ""understatement."" The reason I am being a fancy asshole about it is that I have never in my life been more upset about the death of a fictional character than I was about Mark Darcy. 'Devastated' would be an accurate word for my emotional state. Also 'destroyed.' And 'demolished.' I am laid waste to. The more astute of you will notice that I am now employing the opposite of litotes -- hyperbole -- which is one of my favorite and most used forms of expression. I am doing this because I am a fancy asshole, as stated previously, but also because I am putting off as long as possible having to write the rest of this review, which I am convinced will crumble me until I am nothing more than dusty remains of what used to be a person. 
 Because Fuckin' A, Mark Darcy is dead. 
 Initially, I wasn't even going to read the thing. I felt betrayed. I felt it was unnecessary and cruel. And I hadn't even liked the second book all that much anyway SO THERE. But then I got curious. And a friend reviewed it positively. And I gave in. 
 I'm so glad I did. I loved this book. I loved it hard. I loved it against my will. 
 If the first two books were about Bridget coping with the life of a terminally single woman, and then learning to navigate the perils of adult relationships, and both of those things were now accomplished, then what is the point of having a third book? Well, it turns out that what Bridget is coping with this time around is how a person can live through their grief and come out the other side. Fielding is also clearly interested in examining through Bridget the process of coming to terms with aging, and what's like to have to start over after you thought you were done. You had it in the bag. And I think it's something she succeeds at handily. 
 It's not that these topics are anything new. Actually, I'm fairly sure there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of books written surrounding similar issues. What sets this one apart, however, is that we knew Bridget before she was a fifty-year old widow with two young children, grieving over a husband she loved very much. We fell in love with Mark Darcy as she fell in love with him, we experienced their relationship pangs and joys together, and we were almost as happy as she was when their story ended in a -- what turned out to be -- temporary happy ending. So now, we're not just reading a story about a widow trying to start her life over and cope with her loss, we're experiencing those losses with someone very like a friend. And we're not just reading about her grief; we're experience it right along with her. I felt physical pain during the scenes when Bridget thought about her dead husband, what his face looked like the night their daughter was born, how he kissed her goodbye the last time she saw him, how he would never see his children grow up. 
 And the thing about those scenes is that Fielding uses them so sparingly, interweaving them with episodes of Bridget's awkwardness in dating, in parenting, in friendship, and in work, that they hit all that much harder when they appear. Bridget is trying so very hard to move past the death of her husband. She isn't dwelling on it (at least anymore, but it's been years in book time since Darcy's death). Fielding's style very much reflects Bridget's state of mind. I found myself alternately sobbing and laughing on more than one occasion. 
 Because yes, this is a sad book. But is also a very, very funny one. 
 So if you take anything from this review, if you're one of those people who are refusing to read this book because of what you heard on the news, I ask that you reconsider. It might stil be painful for you, but it will be painful in a way that feels true, and you will come out the other side just fine, just as Bridget does. Maybe you've just got a little more sadness mixed in with the rest. 
 I'm almost tempted to give Mad About the Boy five stars, writing this. But she did kill Mark Darcy after all, and we can't let her completely get away with it.

755,186074,5,"""March 2011: 
 After re-reading it in preparation for The Wise Man's Fear, there are five things I want to say about The Name of the Wind: 
 1. It was just as engrossing [?] if not more so [?] the second time. I found myself eagerly looking forward to parts I didn't even know were coming the first time around. 
 2. It struck me this time through how young Kvothe is. The first time, as soon as he hit the University, I began picturing him as a young man of seventeen or eighteen, and all of his actions were colored through that lens, but he was still just fifteen. He just speaks so much older than that, that my mind automatically pictures this confident, handsome redhead. Picturing him accurately really affected the way that I saw the rest of the book unfold (not in a bad way, mind you). More like, wow. You're just a kid. WOW. 
 3. This in turn led me to a whole new realization that there is SO MUCH MORE STORY FOR ME TO READ, and some of it is currently sitting ON TOP OF MY BOOKSHELF. (You guys: don't let me start that book until next Friday at 4 PM. Otherwise I will FAIL my Master's Exams.) 
 4. I like to RANDOMLY CAPITALIZE things LIKE Kirstie ALLEY. 
 5. Number five is something I'm surprised I didn't mention in my first review, although I kind of mentioned it when I talked about running around and screaming and throwing up and such (I cringe whenever I re-read that first review, BTW . . . you guys don't even know how many times I've almost deleted it; there's just something about it I'm not happy with). Number five is about music. Simply put, The Name of the Wind is the one and only book I've EVER read (and I have read so many fucking books, you guys), that has EVER portrayed in words the way that I feel about music. I don't know how Rothfuss did it, that fucker. Even if you don't like fantasy or magic or love stories or revenge stories or growing up stories or school stories . . . read this book for the music. Capiche? 
 March 2009: 
 This is a hard review to write for such an easy-to-read book. I'm going to preface this review by saying that I haven't read a book this fast or this hard (that's what she said) since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I'm also going to say that I only have one criteria for how many stars I give a book: how many feelings it can make me feel. 
 And not bad feelings, mind you, like anger or frustration, good feelings like suspense and nervousness and love and, well, everything the characters are feeling. No book is perfect, this one certainly isn't, but I loved it, and that's enough for me. Por ejemplo, there's this scene in the middle of the book when Kvothe is attempting to prove himself, and I had to put down the book and run around my room screaming for a little because the scene was making me so nervous I was getting sick to my stomach. That's how you know it's the good shit. 
 Let me explain even further. Pat Rothfuss was doing something different in writing this book. He has broken all the rules, or rather, he doesn't care about them and he admits as much in the book itself. ""We have all the groundwork now. A foundation of a story to build upon,"" says Kvothe, our hero, at the end of 653 pages. That's something you'd expect to hear around page 100 if this were a normal book. But no, this book doesn't follow the traditional story arc. It is a rambling biography of a man who is lost, told in his own voice. It is subjective and flawed. It is also only the beginning of the story. 
 There are two more (yet-to-be-published) books in the Kingkiller Chronicle, so instead of thinking of this as one book, you should more accurately be thinking of it as part one in a giant big ass novel. If you're not feeling closure after you finish this book, that's okay, he's only just begun. If that doesn't sound like something you're interested in, then stay away, but if you feel like pulling the stick out of your butt and trying something new, this comes highly recommended. 
 [Also, I would like to state that I wish I hadn't read it so soon because now I have to wait for books two and three. Dammit.:]""",2008-12-07 20:18:31,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

768,186074,4,"""This is classic fantasy done wonderfully. My horrified reaction to reaching the ending really sums up my rating of this book: It ends here?! But I need more! 
 After reading a lot of gritty fantasy, far-flung sci-fi and New Weird, this book feels like coming home to what first drew me into traditional fantasy. It has just about all the fantasy tropes you could wish for but somehow it doesn't feel predictable. The prose itself is a pleasure to read--not high-flying literary, not purple, just polished and clear. The scenes and settings are drawn with rich detail. It feels more real and nuanced than a lot of fantasy. And the characters, archetypes though they are, are fleshed out into real people I can care about. The book has a cool framing device, and it's just fascinating to watch young Kvothe grow up, ascend to Amazing Wizard Skillz, and then wonder how he fell so far. 
 The one element that keeps me from giving this book a 5 star rating is, I think, the supreme competence of the main character, Kvothe. I can do without characters who are Good At Everything and So Trodden Upon. Seriously, he's master musician and magician and all around Knower of Things. Plus he's super quick and clever and tough after surviving an adolescence in the streets. 
 The other strengths of the book are enough that I was able to just kind of roll my eyes at the overweening Awesomeness of Kvothe, and I would highly recommend it to any fantasy fan. And I have to go find the sequel to find out more about this guy's story!""",2014-05-14 19:06:09,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
769,15677,4,"""This book is brutal in the combination of the deranged plot and the seeming inevitability of the characters' spirals. It's even hard to know how much to say about this book because of spoilers, but I think the point of the story isn't the unfolding of the plot so much as the characters' reactions to it. Once the two meet on the train, there's a horrible momentum that pulls the characters along their painful tracks. 
 Although there is a good deal of tension, the book does slow in places. Both characters have their arcs, but a lot of that is internal agonizing (and Bruno being drunk). It's hard to like any of the characters even as I root for someone to salvage a happy ending (which became more and more difficult as the story progressed). 
 This book is really well done; the author builds the atmosphere and tightens the thumbscrews on the characters quite effectively. Too effectively for my personal taste; it's like watching a car wreck in slow motion. I kept reading to see how the characters would fare, hoping for some respite but fearing the worst.

 Hm. Maybe it's not about the book. Maybe it's the weather. Or maybe my blood pressure is not right today. But Poison Promise disappointed me quite a lot. Which is strange, because I can see that my friends, even the ones, who don't particularly love Elemental Assassin liked this book. So why didn't I? 
 That's a good question. Premise of villain feeding of his victims' emotions was undeniably intriguing. In our messed up, stressful world, I would like to have this power as well. Just by going to school during exams or work before deadline, I would get to eat all the delicious emotions I could dream of. Yummy. 
 But that idea was pretty much all I liked about Poison Promise. Don't misunderstand me, there wasn't anything wrong with this book. Maybe if it was a standalone or if it was second or third book in the series, I would love it. But after ten previous installments, it just felt like deja vu. As if I already read it before. Because in a way I did. 
 Gin was working at Pork Pit. She spent some time with her friends. Then one of her friends got in trouble. Someone got killed. Someone evil appeared. Gin saved someone. Gin got kidnapped. She miraculously escaped. Happy ending. (And I won't even mark these as spoilers, before if you read all 10 EA books, there would have to be something seriously wrong with you, if this story line still surprised you). 
 There is just so many things I didn't like in this book. It's getting on my nerves that everyone is just so beautiful, gorgeous, stunning, handsome. Wake up call: people aren't perfect! And Bria was just being a bitch in this one. And there wasn't nearly enough Finn and Owen for me to forget about all the things I didn't like. 
 When  Benson drugged Gin, I was hopeful for a minute or two. I really hoped that she would finally be less than perfect and that maybe she would get addicted to Burn. That she would get messed up and it would shake things up a little bit. I don't usually like it when main characters are under influence of something dark and evil, but I really just wanted to see some twist. But no. Gin was perfect and invincible as always. I'm starting to think that if meteor hit her, she would just walk it off.  
 And don't even get me started on the whole M. M. M. thing.  I was so glad we got rid of Mab Monroe. And now she is basically back. New Mab Monroe, New Elliot Slater and Old Jonah McAllister. WHY would Estep think we need to fight the same old villains all over again?  
 To sum it up, I'm obviously ungrateful bitch today. I wanted to enjoy Poison Promise, but to be honest, once I started reading, I just wanted it to be over ASAP. I really hope Estep has some secret weapon saved for her next book, because I'm getting sick of reliving the same old story lines over and over again.""",2016-05-26 10:19:52,"Poison Promise (Elemental Assassin, #11)",fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Jennifer Estep

I have been listening to this audiobook for 4 months...4 MONTHS. It's long. And I kept putting it aside and forgetting about it. 
 When I am listening to it I am immersed in the performance. When I am not, it falls to the back of my mind - out of sight, out of mind. 
 When I am listening to it I curious about the many, many threads of Kvothe's story and where they are all going. When I am not, I don't think back on what I just heard, where I left off. Again...out of sight, out of mind. 
 When I am listening to it, I think that the story is full of twists and turns, and has so much potential. When I am not I am trying to remember where I left off in the story, and what was happening. 
 How can a book be so engrossing when I am actively in it, but so forgettable 5 minutes later? All in all, this wasn't a waste of time, but I think Kvothe's cockiness (from his crazy high intelligence, musical talent, and magical talent) became a bit annoying, and the slowness of it all was just too slow for me. 700+ pages and all I can think is not that much happens, which isn't a fair assessment as the book covers a huge chunk of the character's lifetime, but in relation to the overarching plot...not that much happens. I *think* that's supposed to be the point - that you are supposed to luxuriate in the story telling and prose, and while I can appreciate that I also need plot development. 
 Not sure I will read the 2nd book (especially given that the 3rd book doesn't seem to be coming anytime soon), but that book is even longer.

 Confused? 
 Me too. 
 This book is what it is and I think in hindsight I am trying to turn it into something else. This book IS a PARANORMAL ROMANCE. Yes it is also a little bit urban fantasy but it is paranormal romance first and foremost. So as a PNR it is a 4 star book but as a UF book it is 3 stars. 
 The world the characters live in is your normal were, vampire, fae world where people ""know"" about supernaturals but they are still very much shrouded in secrecy. The main character works at a dating service for supernaturals to meet and date other supernaturals. She meets a were through the agency and ends up dating him as an absolute last resort. 
 Well of course from here that means they can only fall in love, realize they are perfect together, come across some problem that prevents their being together, have a near death situation a time or 2, overcome said problem, survive said situation, and spend the rest of their lives having sex and loving it. (And omg the sex - lordy - I need a fainting couch.) 
 Predictable? Yes. 
 But it has what so few books are able to capture these days and it is a sense of humor. 
 This book had one liners left and right, fantastic banter between the 2 lead characters, and enough dry wit to make even a Brit crack a smile. This book was recommended by Ilona of the amazing Ilona Andrews duo whose sense of humor is the best I have ever read, so when she said it would be funny I took her word for it, and she was not lying.

 The Body Electric was what I wish every single Young Adult book would be like; entertaining, free of stupid tropes, and original. 
 *coughs* and it has a really pretty cover *coughs* 
 This book revolves around Ella Shepherd. She's an awesome main character. Not once did I get annoyed with her. Ella is confused about what is going on with her, but I never thought that this caused her to make annoying/stupid decisions. Her reactions to things always felt realistic to me, as well. 
 She also has this awesome to read about relationship with Jack. It isn't instalove. It isn't sappy. It feels real and sweet and...ship-worthy. That's something I don't say very often. I. don't. ship. I tolerate, usually. I am a so very non-romantic guys. It is a problem when all you read is Young Adult, but I manage. But Jack and Ella were good together, even I'll admit that. 
 The plot...this is where I get conflicted, because on one hand, I guessed a lot of the plot twists. It was kind of like Cinder, where I could see something coming, but not in an annoying way where I was mad that it was easy to spot? kind of a coincidence, considering both of these stories deal with cyborgs, hmm.  I suppose that doesn't make much sense. They were good turns to the storyline, they just were guess-worthy good turns to the storyline. I still thought the overall story was well crafted and different than anything I've read before. 
 The writing is something I usually don't talk about in reviews, but I think it really deserves to be mentioned here, because it was soooo great! It definitely made the story for me. I felt that it captured Ella's voice really well, which is possibly also why I liked her so much. It was great. 
 Plus, it's a standalone. There wasn't any cliffhanger at the end. I like a book that actually ends with a concrete resolution. I mean, cliffhangers are fine too, but they make me AGONIZE for months until the next book in the series comes out, which is not fun.

The heroine, Bathsheba, is a regular human who works for a dating agency for supernaturals, even though that puts her and her sister in close contact with them.

Beau, a cougar-shifter, is one of their new clients, and when his first arranged date cancels, Bathsheba panics. Her boss is going to kill her, she thinks, so when Beau proposes she replace his date, she accepts. 
 This was a bit of a mess. I didn't click with the voice or the supposed humour at all. To me, the situations weren't hilarious or lighthearted, they were stupid and juvenile. Bathsheba and her sister didn't have a brain to share between them (see, among many other idiotic decisions, their job at exactly the right place where the sister would be most at risk), and Beau was smarmy and a borderline psychopath.

 . 
 Now that was some wicked, delightful, 
 bloody 
 fun. 
 I enjoyed this book so much. 
 Probably more than I intended to. And it's extremely short. The book barely clocks in 300 pages. However, it is an arc so there's that but I actually, genuinely, enjoy this format a lot better. 
 The main character is Hawaiian and there's some great LGBTQ representation in the book as well. I could relate very well with the main character, whose name is, Mariko Young. Going to a midwestern state after growing up in a diverse community with a well verse culture, was a complete shock to the system. To give you some background info, I was born and raised in California. However, for my freshman year of college, I went to a private university in Kansas. And oooh boy. Different as fuck. But eye opening and a wonderful experience. 
 The kills in the book were real bloody, bloody. I loved it. Not to sound like some sick person but I surprisingly winced at some of parts of the book and had to take a couple breaths at times because it was so gruesome. And I can actually watch it on screen no problem. Written on paper, however.... 
 If not for the YA classification, this book, were it made into a movie, would be hardcore rated R. Not just for bloody violence but for the profanity as well. It had so much more than the average YA book. I'm actually surprised that this book will be released for ages 14+. Don't get me wrong, kids of all ages swear and cuss all the time now, but I thought it was rare for YA books to contain at least more than two or three f-words. I also think the book itself would have benefited so much more if the characters in were in college instead of in high school. Realistically speaking of course. 
 Overall, There's Someone Inside Your House, was fun fun fun. Definitely recommend. It's funny actually, I was really hesitant and wary of reading this book because of the author's previous works. This was my first book from her and I wasn't disappointed! Stephanie had only written teen romance contemporaries beforehand and I was kind of curious and careful as to see how she would handle horror. 
 But good job, Ms. Perkins. Kudos to you. I hope you come back to this particular genre in the future. 
 Nonetheless, this book wasn't perfect. But easily the most entertaining book I've read all year.

I have to admit that I was much more interested in what was going on at the Waystone Inn than I was in hearing the story of everything that might possibly have contributed to who he became. Some of it was just wading through the tropes of what must happen to a main character in epic fantasy to make them into the hero (or antihero, or both) that they become and I really found that tiring in places. Especially because we had to go through all of them, not just one or two selected tropes - this main character has them all. But in a really fun-to-read way.

 Character development: I liked the way he develops both his primary and secondary characters. They don't just say things that advance the plot, they are play their parts well. I remember stopping several times to enjoy the interaction with relatively minor characters. 
 Humor: It's a reasonably witty novel, I found myself chuckling both at the banter between the characters and also at some of the soliloquy observations of the main POV characters. 
 Page turner: While I was reading this book several friends and associates noticed me not wanting to put the book down (when I got home, when I got to work ... I figure that's a good thing). 
 What I thought could have been improved: 
 A couple of times in the book the author mentions relatively modern concepts such as 'germs' which feel like they're out of place in the medieval setting (even with the existence of magic).

As I've said before, I have no problem with books in a series, BUT I want each book to stand on its own as well...especially the first in a series... With this one, the story was completely gripping, but the book ended right in the middle of the telling.

However, this bargain is merely a ruse so that Alex can spend more time with Owen and get him to fall in love with her instead. Thus, she deceives Owen and lies to him about what Lavinia wants in a man. 
 I honestly did not buy their connection. It was rather superficial, because they didn't have many get-to-know each other conversations. Aside from their dance lessons and parties, they didn't spend a lot of time together one on one and didn't exactly have a whirlwind romance. I thought they fell in love too quickly. Because Alex was the one who was actually doing the chasing and lying, I didn't really get why Owen was the one groveling in the end. 
 Witty banter aside, the last quarter of the book was rather anticlimactic, and the sex scene felt flat. Alex's bratty sister Lavinia on the other hand was a scene stealer. I actually liked the way she ridiculed men, and without her tantrum at the end, she would have been a much more likable character. 
 This wasn't my favorite novel in the Playful Brides series, which has so far been hit or miss.

 Overall. 
 I really liked this book (up until the end), which is why I docked a star (or a half). It was different, it was entertaining, and gripping. There was action, mystery, a little romance. What I love about this book the most though, is that its one book. Not a trilogy or duology. Could another book be made? Sure. But it's not needed. This book is complex with the twists and characters and Revis once again builds an amazing back drop that is so easy to follow, believe and see. Even though the book is set in the future, its set on Earth. Its also set in the Malta region. A region I know absolutely nothing about. (Okay Im exaggerating but I know very little). I will say, that the one thing that nagged me through out this book was that some things seemed REALLY out of place or obvious to me, and considering Ella was pretty keen, by the end I was annoyed that she didnt figure certain pieces out sooner. Now to be fair, this book threw even me off! I was surprised by some of the twists and facts that presented themselves throughout the book. Of course some things I saw coming, but others? No way. BUT, I know there is always a BUT, a few of these ""twists"" were not twists that I was happy with. Especially the one about Jack. Without giving anything away, I was REALLY disappointed with this. And at times I felt there was a slight (I said SLIGHT) similariy to Keary Taylor's Eden Trilogy. 
 I must say though, I am more than impressed with Revis' world building ability and her ability to really draw me into the characters, falling completly in love with Ella and Jack, as individual characters (as compared to a romantic couple). Even though I in no way can relate to Ella and Jack, I felt connected to them. I wanted to know their story, I wanted to know them personally, I wanted to know their history and their love. I was intrigued and invested. 
 Plot- 
 This story line was fresh and new to me! While I had similar points of interest as other books out there (its hard not to these days), I found that Revis really gave a fresh new take on the idea. We follow Ella as she tries to figure out whether the government or a rebel group are the ones out to exploit her late fathers and dying mothers work and research. set in a futuristic dystopian world, where it seems Big Brother exists and people are content to be submissive to the governments whim, Ella finds herself in a peculiar situation. She must decide whether helping the government is the ""right"" thing to do, or whether the government is the one on the wrong side of things. 
 There are a lot of scientific/technology pieces to this book, that can at times be hard to follow, but as usual Revis set the back drop up perfectly, weaving a story that we must continue to follow in order to find our way out. I was struck by the story telling, which is the primary focus of the book. While there is a love interest, it is a minor role in this book. Instead the primary focus is figuring out the governments plan and whether Ella is willing to help them. Or if their plan is everything she has been working against since the beginning. Where does the line begin and end? This is a constant battle of who is right and wrong? who can you trust when you arent sure you can trust yourself? Following this story was so much fun. I was happy though with the way things unfolded and the ending was perfect.""",2014-09-04 12:33:44,The Body Electric,young-adult;fiction;romance;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Beth Revis
799,21853680,4,"""In my experience, essay collections tend to be uneven and repetitive. While this particular collection didn't completely escape, it was surprisingly enlightening and enjoyable with pretty consistent quality. 
 My favorite essay was the one by Lionel Shriver, who made a good case for why someone would not want to have children while acknowledging that this represents a societal value shift that may not reflect entirely positively on us. Other authors wrote more personally about going through periods of ambivalence followed by resolution and making peace with the decision to be childless. Some essays touched me more than others, but the vast majority of them were interesting and provocative. 
 As someone who grew up in a society where it's pretty much a foregone conclusion that one will become a parent (provided circumstances allow), a decision that goes largely unexamined and unquestioned, it was fascinating to read about this as a complex choice.""",2015-11-02 05:14:07,"Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on The Decision Not To Have Kids",non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;children,Meghan Daum;Kate Christensen;Tim Kreider;Paul Lisicky;M.G.

800,8683812,2,"""Meh. 
 I really should have known. I don't usually appreciate these speculative fictionalized biographies. Part of it, admittedly, is my anal resistance to the whole maybe-maybe not thing about whether these people actually said this or were like that. But another piece of it is that the balance between an author's trying to be true to the story and imagining richly developed characters is a delicate one that is rarely achieved. I appreciate both McLain's research and her stated intention to give young Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley, emotional substance. Unfortunately, I think the latter suffered at the expense of the former. Perhaps it was because of her attention to detail and her desire for authenticity that I never experienced Ernest or Hadley as flesh-and-blood characters with whom I could empathize. 
 I always thought of Ernest Hemingway as kind of a jerk (my love for 
 The Old Man and the Sea notwithstanding) and was a bit curious to see how that played out with Hadley and others. Here, though, he simply seemed like nothing more than a bland, loving husband until one day he wasn't. Jerky behaviors with his friends had a similarly superficial feeling. As for Hadley, although she expressed passion for Ernest I never actually felt it. It kind of seemed like she was going through the motions. The famous contemporaries who made appearances also didn't have a lot of personality; it started to feel like name-dropping after a while as Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and others kind of came and went without a lot of action. The plot was slow as well, which I might have forgiven had I been more interested in the characters. 
 I wish I had liked it better, in part because I'm starting to worry about my curmudgeonly tendencies. It did inspire me to read more Hemingway, so it gets some points for that.""",2012-03-16 05:11:03,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

 This clicheed immigrant story might have been redeemed by a more interesting heroine; alas, Eilis is probably the most passive individual I've ever had the misfortune to read an entire book about.

Truly Madly Yours wasn't as great as her See Jane Score, but it was far better than my last Gibson read, Sex, Lies, and Online Dating). Delaney was an engaging and unusual heroine - her sense of style would be interesting to see in person, lol - and Nick was one of those wonderful bad-boy heroes. Plus the chemistry between these two was intense; Gibson certainly knows how to write scenes that will have your skin tingling and make you reach for something to fan yourself with. 
 At times I thought the antagonism between them was a little too much, even though it makes complete sense due to their personal histories - and their complex shared one. Still, I felt like those little nuggets of accord and sweet/tender/funny/cute/etc. moments were a little too few and far between in the first half of the book, if not the first two-thirds. Nick often almost crossed the line into being a little too mean for my taste, but it was usually fixed with an apology/clarification on his part not too long after. 
 Though there was a little too much yo-yo-ing for me in Nick's behavior towards Delaney and I would have preferred him to be a bit more constant and consistent, this book was a great read and one I look forward to picking up again in the future.""",2009-07-31 17:27:15,"Truly Madly Yours (Truly, Idaho, #1)",romance;fiction,Rachel Gibson

 This was amazing. So close to perfection. Probably my favorite book of the year. Just wow. WOW. 
 I could not put it down. 
 Amy Lane just stabbed me in the heart with her knitting needles and wiggled them around for a while. For some reason this made my love for her grow. 
 A Solid Core of Alpha is one of those books where I can't believe I waited so long to read it, and at the same time I wish I waited longer. Only because I want to experience the whole thing over again, like new. Make sense? Probably not. Remember, I've just been stabbed in the chest, so I'm allowed to spread confusion on account of the bleeding out. 
 I am running out of ways to express my love for Amy Lane. She just slays me. She is so adept at writing these beautifully painful scenes. They're just...no words. Amy Lane writes amazing characters, period. I have no choice but to empathize with them. I can always relate to them. They are deep. They grow. They break my fucking heart. 
 I'm aware that I'm borderline fangirling right now but I can't stop myself even though it fills me with self-loathing. 
 I felt so much pain for Anderson and C.J., and ok happiness too. I giggled, I cried buckets, I smiled a lot. My sad ""omg when will all the pain stop"" tears turned into happy sentimental tears by the end. I'm actually pretty sure that I'm dehydrated right now, because I could. Not. Stop. Crying. 
 I feel emotionally ravaged. I have words like poignant, gutted, and radiant floating around in my head, but I can't form them into sentences because I haven't reacquired the ability to think straight. 
 Anderson has so many facets to his personality. He is one of the most fascinating characters I've encountered. Ever. He needs lots of cuddles to atone for the pure fuckery that was his life. I loved him, and he ripped my heart out of my chest repeatedly. C.J. was lovely too. I liked his POV the most. He also contributed to the heart ripping. The love between Anderson and C.J. is so raw. It's sweet, it hurts, and it's beautiful. I just felt so much for both characters. Amy Lane just makes me FEEL. So many different emotions. I was drowning in them. DROWNING. 
 Also, amazing sexual tension. I love me some sexual tension, and this book had it in spades. 
 Oh, hell yes. 
 Anderson and C.J. were on fire. Seriously, this book is HOT AS HELL. 
 The world building in this is so beyond great. I actually refuse to summarize the plot based on the fact that I would never be able to do it justice. I was hooked from the first page, and I wish Amy Lane would write more Science Fiction. 
 The only remotely negative thought I'm left with is I that the ending went a teensy longer than necessary. Also, I beyond hate the cover. 
 At the end of the day 
 Not the heartache. Not the tears. Not a thing. 
 This was brilliant.

815,29780253,5,"""I think what is amazing about this book is that it's doing so many things simultaneously. 
 - It gives a bare bones history of South Africa. Enough history is provided to give a context to the things that Noah was dealing with in his life. 
 - It explains the complexities of being mixed and never belonging anywhere you go. 
 - It talks about his mother's life and her choices from Noah's point of view as her son. But he goes beyond his own perspective and tries to imagine her point of view as well. I felt he showed his mother so much honor in this book. 
 - It talks about the emotional life of an abused family. For me, these portions were told with such truth and depth. 
 - It talks about the failings of the justice system towards women. ""They were men first, and police second."" This quote chilled me to the bones. 
 - It talks about labor and work that happens in poor communities. And how poor people's labor never leads to wealth. 
 - It talks about the role of faith in his mother's life. 
 That is the mind trip of this book. It's talking race, systematic oppression, apartheid, labor, education, policing, prisons, domestic violence, feminism, masculinity, family, childhood, adolescence, etc. And Noah is able to talk about all these things from the point of view of his lived experience with complete candor. And his writing style is one of those where it sounds so conversational, so casual, -- until you notice how intricately humor is woven with pathos, and how effortlessly historical fact is melded with emotion. His writing style is amazing. (And this book was a page turner. I read it in about three days.) 
 I left this book feeling educated about South Africa and also moved. Moved by Noah's mother-- her courage as a young woman and her consistency and strength as a mother. And also I was moved by Noah as a writer and as a son. I really respect Noah for the beautiful way in which he depicted his mother's life. 
 The only thing I wish was that there had been a trigger warning for domestic violence --I was not aware of that going into the book, and it was quite frightening to read.""",2017-08-16 06:45:20,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah

821,29064340,4,"""I could count on one hand the number of dark romances I've read, so I am no expert in this sub-genre. I really enjoyed another captive romance/action-adventure with an anti-hero called Spotless. This is not that book. Far, far from it. That book had me laughing out loud despite the deadly assassin vibe coming off the hero, March. This book's hero, and I use that term loosely, had a fake name, too, along with an expertise in guns and knives. That is about as far as similarities went. 
 ""Six"" is a cold-blooded murderer who completely gave me the creeps - at least when he wasn't ratcheting the temperature up in the room with his lust for his captive, Paisley. The heroine is a normal girl with an average job and above-average looks. She's had a dry spell in the romance department and pulls double shifts. One fateful night she hooks up with Mr. Tall, Dark and Handsome, who is in town on business. They burn up the sheets, and Paisley has found her sexual nirvana. The next day her life is a shambles. Author K.I. Lynn goes to lengths to play up the normalcy of Paisley, who abruptly finds herself in circumstances that are irrational and unbelievable. 
 Turns out, Mr. Tall, Dark and Handsome is a sociopath going by the name of Six. He's an assassin who is now being hunted, and Paisley has crossed his path. Elements of this story reminded me of Jason Bourne dragging along the German girl, Marie, in Bourne Identity. However, Six makes Jason Bourne look like a Boy Scout. The dark romance tag is well-deserved. I was admittedly shocked by several scenes (being a novice reader of dark romance) and this book is very heavy on sexual content. 
 The story is told entirely from Paisley's point of view. This makes Six enigmatic and scary and his motives totally unknown. The lack of knowledge about who and what Six is makes the beginning of this thriller especially tense. However, by the time I was 50% of the way into the book, I was ready for a little more context. Overall, the pace at which the story unfolded was uneven and I felt things lagged at times. 
 Joking and sarcasm were my steady companion and defense mechanism. Without them, I didn't want to think about the broken, frightened girl I'd be. It was the strength I needed to get to the next minute. 
 This mockery that Paisley shields herself with confuses, intrigues and attracts Six. However, it doesn't stop him from threatening to end her life on a consistent basis. Paisley comes to understand she is living on borrowed time, so she embraces the sexual gratification Six can offer. And he offers a lot since apparently assassins have high sex drives. These motivations/explanations for the gratuitous sex in the book were a bit of a leap for me. Luckily, they weren't overly repetitive. Six takes Paisley to the highest highs only to dump her into the scariest of hells. At times he is chillingly impassive, then unimaginably cruel, and it is very unnerving. 
 For awhile, Paisley slides into clear self-destructive behavior. Only humiliation and fear seem to register with her. It was an emotional ride I was uncomfortable taking. 
 The duality raging inside me had me not knowing which side was up and hanging on for dear life......but nevertheless....nothing made me feel as alive as taunting Six. 
 The action-adventure part of the story speeds up in the latter half, which allows the twisted relationship between Six and Paisley to broaden. Notice I didn't say deepen. Six continues to be a frustratingly blank slate, which maintains the suspense regarding the future bullet to the brain he keeps promising Paisley. Will he or won't he?

He is still somewhat of a stick-in-the-mud, but his backstory does add more to the picture that is Tyler. Parts of the book were a little uneven for me - I didn't like Memphis at first and though it's clear what his issues are, the dynamic between him and Tyler explain why Memphis acts the way he does... as well as his medical history. Nice interplay between all the guys, especially Noah. Eager to read his book which I believe is book 3. Couple of very annoying writing tics for me - the author uses Judas Priest and Jesus Haploid Christ to express surprise or frustration multiple times. Got really tiresome after about the 10th time. Also wondered about the odd focus on Julissa, Memphis' ex-wife. She got a lot of page time. Was happy to see she wasn't the usual female harpy you sometimes see in LGBTQ reads, but still wondered why featured so prominently. Kudos to the author for adding a diverse character but that could have been accomplished with a little less focus.

828,24357334,5,"""Just a disclaimer, don't read this book halfway and then read the summary, because there is a spoiler. I made that mistake and so I knew the ending. 
 I flew through this book. Like, I had it finished within a day because it was such a powerfully emotional book dealing with very tough themes. 
 This book deals with Nick and Steph, two characters we'd met in the previous books. We knew a bit about Nick as he worked the bar with Roxy and Calla, but all we knew was that he was very mysterious with a lot of secrets. Steph had gone to college with both Calla and Teresa, and was known because she had slept with the previous books' love interests. What Nick and Steph both had in common was they were both on the one-night-stand-train with no hurry to get off. 
 While we think we know these characters, Jen has, as usual, worked her magic and created a depth to these characters we thought we understood. 
 Steph is fresh out of college, and has a lot of plans with her life. She's got a new job, and plans on working her way up the corporal ladder as she gains experience. She has a lot she wants to do with her life - travel the world and hopefully find someone who loves her as much as her parents loved each other. However, she believes that unless she meets someone who is ""the one"", then what's the point in relationships? It's better to have no strings attached than getting your heart broken. 
 Nick is the mysterious bartender we'd already met in Stay With Me and Fall With Me, the one I knew had a lot more going on than he was showing. I knew Jen had a lot of plans with him, and we get to see a totally different side to him in this book. We understand why he's so distant and why he only has one-night-stands; his almost ""fear"" of relationships is explained and you feel so much closer to his character because of it. 
 After meeting each other, Steph and Nick's lives are irreparably changed. Their lives start heading in a direction neither expected, but was actually needed. Their situation is totally unforeseeable, and I was so surprised at the turn Jen made. It was a very unusual and uncommon route to take, but I think Jen handled it incredibly well and very realistically. For Steph, this turn is scary that rocks her world and all the plans she made. But after coming to terms with it, she and Nick start a wonderful journey while they attempt to walk down the twisty road together. I loved how they leaned on each other and how supportive Nick was for Steph. Their relationship blossomed slowly, with them learning about each other throughout the book and becoming closer because of it. Neither of them is any good at relationships, so Steph often has moments of self-doubt where she wonders if she and Nick would even be together if they weren't forced. There were moments of stupidity where she drove Nick away because of these doubts, but she quickly realised her errors, and she never drove Nick that far away. He always came back. 
 The ending was still emotionally charged and so, so rough. This is the first book I've read that covers topics like this, a topic that is rough around the edges that has different reactions. While the ending had a light at the end of the tunnel for our characters, no one walked away unhurt. 
 Jen wrote a topic that is very realistic and can be quite relatable for a lot of women today. It's not given that much attention as it's a very tough thing to talk about. No one can stay strong after something like this happens, and as Jesse J says, ""It's okay not to be okay."" While it's a topic I can't relate to personally, I'm glad Jen wrote it and that it's out there for others to read about. This will be a tough read for anyone who has gone through what our characters have experienced, and I hope that it helps them get through any lingering hurt they're still facing. 
 This book, and Be With Me, are my two favourites in this series. They both deal with incredibly hard situations, but our main characters persevere regardless, and you can't help but admire their strength. Jen has added a great addition to this series, and I can't wait to meet two new characters that I know I'll love just as much in her next instalment.""",2016-08-23 07:49:52,"Forever with You (Wait for You, #5)",romance;fiction;young-adult,J.

 Alexa Riley returns with the second novella in the Promises series, once again and as I have come to expect, I devoured this book in one sitting. 
 The taking of well used tropes and giving them a smuttier spin, with the addition of an all-sorts of over-the-top alpha male just works, Calder was akin to a dog marking his territory as soon as he came across Felicity, and I absolutely loved that he was a little bit of an asshole in the beginning. I have a thing for assholes, especially when they then spend the latter portions of a book trying to repair the damage their ass-holiness has caused within their relationships. 
 I am all kinds of out of sorts when I'm around him. 
 Innocent kitten Felicity, soon turns into a bit of a lioness when Calder puts his proverbial foot in it and in a big jump-to-conclusions kind of way, and I loved that the authors took this relationships arc over the course of months, even though it was still all-sorts of insta everything, being on different continents for some of the first half meant that everything developed steadily. 
 ""You and I have something that can't be so easily broken."" 
 Again, the whole predictably perfect story-line was finished off with an absolutely stellar epilogue, and a good time was had by all! I wish we had got to read some of the mentioned emails from Calder to Felicity though, nothing pleases me more than a few grovelly, sexy, sweet emails in my romance. However, I cannot wait to see what the Promises series offers up next.

 By Any Other Name is the first book I have read by J. M. Darhower, and those that know me, know I am not one to throw around 5 star ratings without good reason, but this book ticked every damn box I have ever had with regards to my reading 'likes', and added a few more for good measure. It was the kind of book that once you have finished it, you go online and one-click everything else you can find that has been written by that author without giving it a second thought (which I did). 
 ""She must be some girl."" 
 You just know, that they are going to be keeping you happy with their stories for the years to come, and add them to the auto-buy list with no further questions asked. That was this book; this is that type of author. 
 Rivalry, revenge, families at war, forbidden love... all of these tropes aren't new, but when put together and mixed with just the right amount of author talent, and word magic they are winners. J. M. Darhower definitely has that skill, and then some, the story, the lives it encompassed and the way it all weaved together throughout the book, was the perfect mix of everything. 
 ""Don't plant your seeds in someone else's garden or you're liable to be buried six-feet under with fertilizer."" 
 I will admit my first impressions of Genna were totally wrong, when you start the book you initially think, 'spoiled little, mob-girl but as the story progresses you see that on the surface appearances can be so, so deceiving. I loved her attitude and snarky comebacks, this is a girl who isn't afraid to fight for what she wants, even if the ramifications are far reaching and almost outside of her control. 
 ""It's too late for me... I've already looked the soul-stealer in the eyes."" 
 Matty, once again as the story grows and develops turns out to be more than you are initially expecting of him, not your usual son of a mobster, the business, that kind of life and the expectations that come from it are so far outside of what he wants for himself, he has only really returned to town for the one person he still truly loves. 
 So the God has a little bit of the devil in him. 
 After a chance meeting with Genna, things start to progress at break-neck speed for them, when they realize just what kind of connection they have on a personal and familial level. The repercussions are many, the consequences unimaginable and the losses unexpected... 
 This wasn't a book that I am likely to forget any time soon, and I think that will be the same for a lot of readers. I hope we see more from the Forbidden Series and this author in the very near future.

 My college library sucks. 
 But not because it doesn't have books. Oh it has thousands and thousands of books, probably 85% of which are nonfiction and 14% of which are classical fiction, like Shakespeare or Victor Hugo, or even more modern classics, like If on a Winter's Night a Traveler or Song of Solomon. Unfortunately, only a sad 1% is filled with modern fiction that I would read for fun (well, I occasionally read nonfiction and classics for fun too, but not in great volume). 
 But even that 1% sucks. We have Twilight and other ridiculous, fluffy chick lits whose titles I don't even remember. So whenever I see something that's fantasy, I pounce on it. 
 Ysabel by Guy Gavriel Kay was amazing. 
 The Name of the Wind? 
 Let's just say it's been a long time since I tried this hard to like a book. 
 The prologue was drop dead gorgeous, and the idea that the narrator had once been great but is now sidelined and stuck telling his own story is a great concept. 
 But then the storytelling actually begins and all you want to do is facepalm. It trots out cliches and tragic backstories, but the worst of it is the way characters are well, characterized. I guess part of it can be chalked up to the fact that a character is telling the story, so he's not a perfect narrator, but still, I don't think most people tell stories and make themselves out to be a total Mary Sue/Gary Stu and completely peripheralize all other characters. Maybe he is just that much of a megalomaniac, but I feel like that's not what the author is going for. The author gives no indications that the narrator is super unreliable. In fact, the author makes it seem like there are a lot of unreliable legends floating around and the story we're reading the truth. 
 And it's a very shabby, not well set up truth.""",2013-01-15 21:42:55,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

841,186074,4,"""Once I got into it, I finished The Name of the Wind in under a week. It's a blazing fast read, and the motivation to continue drips over the edge of every chapter, making the book very hard to put down. 
 I was most impressed by how Rothfuss successfully navigated scenes that other authors would cringe at attempting and then stumble over or rush through. Any time when a large number of things are enumerated, or an interview happens are good examples of this. 
 It's annoying how a lot of modern fantasy takes on the Harry Potter plot: a young boy gets sent to a school to grow up and hone his skills, and he must solve mysteries along the way. Perhaps it is tried and true, but reading this right after Shaman's Crossing I was struck by how many fantasy novels rely on this approach. 
 The main character himself is a wily, likable sort. Having to manage things like finances to attend school is something nearly everyone can relate to, and it gives him a Peter Parker from Spiderman 2 feel - a hero, but a poor one. His interactions with women though are frustrating and embarrassing to read. I would have enjoyed it if he made the right move even once. 
 My biggest complaint is something I should just call ""series syndrome."" It's not that there was a frustrating cliffhanger ending. It's more that it's obvious the wider story has so much more to it - more tales to tell and threads to resolve - this had a stepping-stone feel to it, and I would much prefer it if my fantasy novels actually accomplished something, more akin to The Eye of the World.""",2008-12-28 12:22:30,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 The story starts off four years after the zombies infect the world. We meet Eve right as she is ready to give up and stop fighting. She is saved by Gage. The boy she knew from her past that broke her heart. Her only love and she is still very bitter. 
 Eve is determined to find her sister, Olive. Eve was the unwanted nuisance and Olive the golden child of the family. A lot of how Eve and Olive feel about themselves and how they react to others is based on this. 
 The book switches points of view from Eve to Gage and eventually Olive. It's confusing at first because it doesn't go by chapter. They can switch from paragraph to paragraph. You have to read closely at times to know who's POV it is. And there are grammatical errors, he instead of she, that can make it even trickier. 
 I had just even in to the fact that this is a book about two horny people in the apocalypse when the plot really started taking shape and drew me in. Once Olive's character started chiming in I was hooked and had to know more. 
 The story slips back and forth to the present and past so to explain why each person acts the way they do. I really enjoyed this part of the book. Each person evolved in an interesting manner. 
 I think the lust in the book sort of overshadowed the great story line. It could have been toned down a bit and made more of an impact. But the plot was great and I am really interested to read the next one! 
 Only part that really bothered me was Gage's obsession with Eve being ""mine"". It made it sound like he was more interested in controlling her than being in love with her. Like he saw her as a possession and not a person. Plus I kept thinking of the Disney bird, ""mine, mine, mine"".

 I'm a massive fan of Darhower and everything she writes. Mafia romances are my absolute favourite and this woman just knows how to write an amazing one, By Any Other Name being no exception. 
 The easiest way to describe this book is by calling it a modern day Romeo and Juliet. The Galante and the Barsanti's are two rival crime families with a fued to rival all others. 
 Genna meets Matty in an elevator and the two of them have instant chemisty. Only problem is, neither of them know that Genna is the daughter of head Galante, Primo and Matty is the son of Roberto, head of the Barsanti family until its too late. 
 ""Their families didn't just carry animosity- they were mortal enemies, hell-bent on destroying each other. The two of them were a disaster waiting to happen."" 
 Genna has had it ingrained into her since an early age to stay clear of the Barsanti family after they killed her eldest brother, but when Matty doesnt seem to care who their families are and pursues her anyway, she doesn't really try to resist and the two of them find themselves in a forbidden romance. 
 ""The only good Barsanti is a dead Barsanti."" 
 Even with Primo Galante and Roberto Barsanti trying to end the others families, a war building around Matty and Genna, they still can't stay away from each other. There's everything I want from a romance, playful banter, stream, lots of feels and depth as well as everything I love about a mafia story- lots of action! 
 ""I risk coming here, because one of us has to take that risk. One of us has to be willing to take the chance."" 
 By Any Other Name is pure Darhower perfection. I loved the story, the characters and the mafia world she created. The little thing that sealed this books awsomeness for me though was Gavin Amero and the mention of the DeMarcos from Sempre, my favourite book. It wasn't much but it made this new world with new families feel all the more real for me.

When it comes to a mystery/thriller, the slightest detail could potentially give something away, and I don't want to do that. Also, I have some thoughts about the BIG THINGS in this book. 
 So here are my vague, non-spoilery thoughts: I really enjoyed this. I liked the characters--though there were a lot of them and I sometimes forgot who was who--and I liked the construction of the story and the simple, classic writing style of Stephanie Perkins. And I really liked the romance and the diversity of characters. It wasn't the best thriller I've ever read--and I wasn't scared or frightened literally at all, so I wouldn't choose this book if you want something spooky--but I liked it and I could see myself reading it again some day. 
 Okay, now for my spoilery thoughts. Beware: 
 I thought this was going to pretty incredible, and while I wasn't blown away, I really liked it. I thought it was interesting (not bad!) that the killer was revealed relatively early in the book--about half way. I was expecting the tension to build and build and build and then GASP! The killer is ____??!?!?!!! And I didn't get that. I liked what she did, but it was unexpected; it also made the book not spooky/scary at all. 
 The only thing I did not like at all was Makani's ""secret"". It was ridiculously dramatic, and honestly, stupid. With all the foreshadowing, I was expecting something darker, but it wasn't dark at all. Hazing and cutting off someone's hair? Not dark or scary or creepy or anything. Just a little stupid.  
 Overall, I enjoyed this! It's not by favorite Stephanie Perkins' novel--it does not compare at all to Anna and the French Kiss--but it was fun.""",2014-06-13 12:24:09,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins
852,4954833,3,"""This was a novel that, while good, felt very light to me. Almost insubstantial. And that confused me, because it dealt with a lot of interesting and potentially heavy questions. The main character, Eilis, is an Irish girl (in the 1950s) who lets others in her life make decisions for her, including allowing her familiy to send her off to Brooklyn to work. She's a very frustrating character, and the reader is constantly wondering when she's going to stand up and make a decision for herself. But all the while the novel explores questions like: What makes a place ""home""? What does that even mean? What is it that forms someone's identity -- nationality, origins, new surroundings, relationships, or something else? Those questions are all dealt with fairly expertly, in plain, straightforward prose that's delightfully smooth and easy to read. Yet the novel also suffers from too many tantalizing themes and plot points that are dropped without any exploration whatsoever. Racism and integration, the recent Holocaust, characters clearly dealing with suppressed homosexuality -- all of these topics are abandoned nearly as soon as they're raised. Making room for them wouldn't have been too hard (the book is only 260 pp. and would not have suffered for being 50 pages longer).

I'm a sucker for school stories, so I liked all the little details of University policies and procedures. I am very fond of Really Big Books and epic series, so this fits the bill in a lot of ways. 
 I have two main beefs, though. First is Denna. She's adored by all men, including Kvothe, but I can't understand why. Her only personality traits seem to be beauty, flirtatiousness, and unpredictability. If I'm to believe in a love that transcends all, I need more depth of character on both sides. Second is the laser focus on Kvothe. We're in this incredibly rich setting, but the action is completely locked onto the main character. I realize this is the result of the storytelling device, but I really, really want to know what's going on away from the main character. The tunnel vision infuriated me at times.

 First off, the book was fun and pretty engaging. There was a strong cast of characters that I had no problem relating to. I'm a sucker for a rag tag group :) I appreciated the action sequences. They were not so overly drawn out and detailed that it bogged down the story progression but they were still well done enough that they didn't leave you wanting. The space travel, well I'm just going to overlook that for now because I in no way believe that there were that many habitable planets, terraformed or not, within a few days flight from one another. That's just not even plausible. But heck, right now travel to one other habitable planet is not really plausible so I'm just letting it go. Spacey wacey and all of that... 
 ""There's just something magical about the idea of a lovely machine that slides over your body and makes it superhuman."" 
 Why, yes, yes there is. 
 Devi was awesome when she was acting like a merc. I loved that she was a weapons/armor gear head. I loved Lady Gray. This is who I think Devi should have been throughout the entire book: 
 ""I was Devi Morris, decorated war hero, former squad leader of the Blackbirds, and future Devastator. I was not going to get all mopey over a man, no matter how funny or handsome or good in bed he was."" 
 That would have been fantastic. That would have made this nearly a 5 star book for me. Sadly, that wasn't meant to be... 
 I just wasn't sold on the romance in this book. It could have done without it completely. Heck, I'm not even sure if I liked Rupert. I almost rooted for her and Cotter (I said almost. Don't hate me!) 
 Now don't get me wrong...I do believe all books should have an underlying romantic element. I just think in this case it should have been more subtle. It was too in your face from the beginning. I know, I know...there are plenty who think it's a good thing, who want to have a couple to root for instantly. And, in some cases, I would agree. In this particular case, however, I think it detracted instead of added to the story-line. If it weren't for that I may have gone 5 stars with this one.

 Nick and Steph are very similar in terms of their approaches to relationships and sex. That gets them off to a pretty good start, but then Nick messes things up by being presumptious. Steph sets him straight and that confrontation turns out to be the beginning of a life changing journey for both of them. 
 As we get to know Nick, it becomes very clear that he is not at all what he seems at first. His heart is so big and it was just waiting for the person who would have the patience and tenacity to stick it out long enough to figure that out. He's had a tough life and Stephanie, with her straight talk and equally big heart is just what he needs. 
 Stephanie is a strong, smart woman. She has her head on straight and I loved that she confronted the double standard that exists when it comes to men and women's sexualities. I liked and understood her and I was so glad that Nick did too. 
 They are both new to relationships and while they don't always get it right, they both have the right intentions. They are a likable couple and I found myself rooting for them to succeed and hurting for them when things got rough. This is an emotional read at times. But the whole cast of characters gives the story moments of levity that keep it from being too heavy.

883,14069,3,"""Review From May 2017: 
 I think I can safely say that I enjoyed this story more the second time around. 
 I only vaguely remembered what happened in this story. I knew there were certain key plot points that were going to happen, but I couldn't remember the details, so it made the re-read a little more intriguing and entertaining. 
 What really makes this book excellent is the cultural differences that Naomi Novik brings up over and over again throughout the novel. She took two existing historical cultures, inserted dragons, and created brilliant contrasts between them. I am very much impressed by the amount of detail that went into this, especially with the politics. Because I was able to focus more on how the two cultures interacted with each other, I felt that the parts that felt tedious before were not as slow this time around. I really found it a fascinating read from an anthropological perspective. 
 I also really love Temeraire. He has such a frank view of the world, and his exposure to different places is making him a very idealistic dragon. It's difficult to argue with his point of view, and I loved watching Laurence struggle with the many debates they've had. Laurence has had a rather narrow-minded upbringing, so watching him slowly open up to new ideas and concepts is making me feel pretty victorious. 
 Anyone who studied the social sciences in high school or college would find this series a pretty fun read. It may not be the most action-packed fantasy out there, but there's enough detail in the back ground to make it worth a look. 
 Review From March 2015: 
 In A Sentence: A decent sequel that dragged a little in parts 
 My Thoughts: This story pretty much met my expectations, to tell you the truth. Knowing how many more books there are in the series, I expected that I would enjoy the story, but I wouldn't be wowed by it. And that's exactly what this novel did for me. 
 For myself (and perhaps because I was listening to this on audiobook), I found the trip to China long and slightly tedious. It took up the majority of the story, and while there were interesting plot points along the way, the pace felt like it dragged a bit more in this book than in the first one. I also found the ""plot twists"" highly predictable, and was more surprised that they happened exactly as I had guessed. I was expecting something a little more intricate, but it was very basic, and I was a little disappointed that it took the characters until the very end to figure it all out. 
 Negative opinions aside, I still enjoyed the story. I love reading about Temeraire and his intellectual growth and idealistic notions. He's the kind of character you would love to have a conversation with. And Laurence is a decent character too, I suppose, although I find him a little too set in his ways, and therefore much more resistant to accepting new ideas, or at least that's how it feels to me. I like watching him unbend a little more though, for Temeraire's sake, and accept new concepts that would fit very well in the 21st century (I can't help it, I'm a modernist; I like modern ideas in my stories, what can I say?). 
 The difference in culture between China and England is also really interesting to read about. I like how we're introduced to a new way of looking at dragons; instead of looking upon them as sentient military airships, we see them instead as poets, scholars, and equals among humans. It's rather nice to look at, and you can't help but want to see if Temeraire and Laurence can positively influence England to change their way of thinking in future installments. 
 Overall this was a decent read, and I'm still inclined to continue reading the series (I'm already deep into Book 3), but the initial wow factor has worn off, and unless the subsequent books prove to be more interesting, I might feel inclined to drop the series after the next couple of books. But for now, I'm content to continue exploring this fascinating new version of Earth where dragons do exist.""",2015-03-29 06:49:16,"Throne of Jade (Temeraire, #2)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;young-adult,Naomi Novik
884,186074,5,"""The Name Of The Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss 
 and a 
 Synopsis: My name is Kvothe, pronounced nearly the same as ""quothe."" Names are important as they tell you a great deal about a person. I've had more names than anyone has a right to. 
 The Adem call me Maedre. Which, depending on how it's spoken, can mean The Flame, The Thunder, or The Broken Tree. 
 ""The Flame"" is obvious if you've ever seen me. I have red hair, bright. If I had been born a couple of hundred years ago I would probably have been burned as a demon. I keep it short but it's unruly. When left to its own devices, it sticks up and makes me look as if I have been set afire. 
 ""The Thunder"" I attribute to a strong baritone and a great deal of stage training at an early age. 
 I've never thought of ""The Broken Tree"" as very significant. Although in retrospect, I suppose it could be considered at least partially prophetic. 
 My first mentor called me E'lir because I was clever and I knew it. My first real lover called me Dulator because she liked the sound of it. I have been called Shadicar, Lightfinger, and Six-String. I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe Kingkiller. I have earned those names. Bought and paid for them. 
 But I was brought up as Kvothe. My father once told me it meant ""to know"". 
 I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned. 
 I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. 
 You may have heard of me. 
 So begins the tale of Kvothe--from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you will come to know Kvothe as a notorious magician, an accomplished thief, a masterful musician, and an infamous assassin. But The Name Of The Wind is so much more-- for the story it tells reveals the truth behind Kvothe's legend. 
 Review: Truthfully, I did not have high expectations for this book when I first started out. While it did high high reviews on Shelfari, and while it was recommended by a friend who loved the same fantasy books I did, I was anticipating a book that followed the characteristics of an archetypal hero, that would have unpronounceable names that would make hardly any sense in the beginning, and that would have a main protagonist that I would eventually find forgettable. 
 Well, the book did follow the rulebook for creating an archetypal hero, and it did have strange, difficult-to-pronounce names whose reference I didn't understand in the beginning, but it did not have a forgettable protagonist. I started the book thinking I would enjoy it, but not be blown away... I not only enjoyed the book, I was blown away! 
 This book did everything it could to meet my expectations, and then go far beyond them. At first, I was able to stop reading and put the book down and get on with my wedding planning. But slowly, the book drew me in, and before I knew it, I was up until past one in the morning for two nights in a row, staring at the clock and wondering where the hell the time went! 
 The writing was wonderfully done; it was smooth and flowing, not forced or disguised as good writing through metaphors and similes. The plot was exciting and well paced, and when things started to slow down a bit, the narrator would hint at dark things to come. And then, just when you think you know what's going to happen (the narrator said it, duh!), the plot turns unexpectedly and you discover it was not the way you thought it was going to be. 
 The creativity of this novel is fantastic too! It starts with things that are familiar, but then Rothfuss puts his own spin on things, making the magic more complex than just waving wands and saying random words, and making the creatures more strange and mysterious, but fascinating nonetheless. 
 The fact that this review is miles long is probably a good indicator of how much I really enjoyed this book. It has now become a favorite, one that I'll want to read again, and definitely one that deserves a place on my bookshelf (I'll only buy a book that I think is worth the read). Even better, it's part one of a trilogy! I can't wait to get my hands on the next one! 
 One small word of warning, though. I personally feel that this is a book that should be read, not listened to on audiobook. I started listening to the audiobook version, but then realized that the names were too strange, and there was too much going on in the book. You can get distracted while listening to an audiobook; you don't want to get distracted while reading this book. You won't regret it if you do. 
 Review Rescued From Shelfari: Wow. What a story! At first, you think it'll be some typical fantasy novel about a brilliant young wizard and his trials and tribulations. But, after a short time, you realize it's so much more than that. 
 Nothing in this book is what I expected. The magic was more complex, somehow, than in other fantasy novels I've read. The creatures were not what I expected either, not at all. There are stories within stories, and truths that take a while to uncover. You might be told hints of what to expect later in the story, then once you're there, you're caught off guard by what happens. 
 This book is truly a gem in fantasy literature. It was a book that enticed me to keep reading with every chapter. I kept telling myself I would stop after the next chapter... well maybe the next one after that.... oh, well the next chapter is really short, I'll stop after that one. Before I knew it, I had read until 1 o'clock, not just once but two nights in a row! 
 On the dedication page, Patrick Rothfuss wrote, ""...And to my father, who taught me that if I was going to do something, I should take my time and do it right.""

The frame story starts off a little slow, but I'm glad I stuck with it. The main story is kind of a fantasy bildungsroman of a bright boy who grows up in a travelling acting troupe. 
 There are at least two types of magic in the book. Sympathy magic is like voodoo dolls, or using the links between things to affect them. I liked that Rothfuss attempted to make some sort of system of it, how the more closely connected two things were the more effective the magic was. The other type of magic I noticed, naming things, seems much more mystical and might be further fleshed out in future books. 
 There was definitely a tension throughout the book between believable conflicts and exciting/convenient ones. I found the rival's antics to be in the convenient camp. I'm also a bit tired of super smart/talented characters, but luckily Kvoth wasn't just smart.

 I've been thinking about this a lot and I'm rating this somewhere between 4-4.5 stars. It was a very good book. 
 You might notice that it took me 2 years to read this (YIKES). I originally started out with the physical copy and just couldn't get into it at first. So I set it aside but kept hearing it is the ~best fantasy ever so I was like okay. Let's do this. Fast forward to a month ago when I decided to listen to the audiobook. 
 The audiobook is SPECTACULAR. It was the saving grace for me. It sounds like an entire voice cast but it's just this one dude. He has so much fun with the characters. And I have to give credit to Rothfuss for his absolutely incredible writing. It's almost like poetry because it's just such pretty language. This is one of the only books I've read where I'm like ""this is a straight up TALE."" And Rothfuss is an amazing storyteller. I have to say, even though Kvothe can be a little punk, he's a great main character that you root for the entire time. I loved his cunning and his courage. I also loved the switch between present and past throughout the story. It's interesting to see Kvothe in the present and how much he's changed. Really, it just makes me want to read book two to see what the heck happened. I think I'm going to like the second book even more based on what we were being led into at the end of the story. All that to say, this was a nearly 28 hour audiobook and I never felt like it was super long. I was invested the whole time. It was a wonderful read and anyone who is interested in the fantasy genre should definitely pick it up.""",2014-02-15 12:26:35,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

903,186074,4,"""A worthy beginning to what is to be an epic fantasy series, the primary detraction being that almost the entire book is backstory. 
 The Name of the Wind is on the literary edge of fantasy--not China Mieville literary...not experimental and multilayered...but it is well-crafted writing with believable characters and a raw serious tone. 
 Nearly the entire novel takes place via the main character telling a story to a ""Chronicler,"" who is capturing it for posterity. So as such, it is retelling the childhood and adolescence of the main character. To some extent, I admired the author's patience. Telling a story in flashback is considered a terrible device because it steals the forward momentum and leaves you feeling in limbo. If I don't care about this character NOW, why should I care about his PAST? Where is it going? But Rothfuss pulls it off...just barely. At times, I did miss the momentum of a more present oriented story. It's a long prologue. And Book #2...more of the same. And to focus on the negative, my only other criticism is a certain lack of humor to balance the relative bleakness of the story. Rothfuss has created a very serious world with much angst. However, it does feel more ""real"" than most fantasy novels. 
 In the world of The Kingkiller Chronicles, we are somewhere between Medieval and Renaissance technology. There are diverse ways to conjure magic that can be learned with hard work and practice. Mystical creatures such as the occasional dragon or fae(ry) exist. Objects can be imbued with magic as well. It's a complex world he builds that has elements of many fantasy constructs but stakes out a unique amalgamation. 
 The story itself features the childhood of a man who appears to be one of the world's great heroes, Kvothe. A powerful magician although in the present he seems to be ""retired"" as an innkeeper and we never learn why. Both this book and the subsequent one (The Wise Man's Fear) tell how he came to be where he is, and then I assume by the time we get to book three (or four?) we will be carried into the present entirely, and he will once again take up sword and magic to defeat the dark forces rising in the world. Yes, that sounds quite cliched but it works. 
 In the end, I was carried by the solid writing and sophisticated world-making. And the believability of the characters. Highly recommended for fans of epic fantasy.

906,17333426,3,"""3.5 
 First of all, I'd say about half of the things in this book were poems while the other half were just jokes with random line breaks in them. I'm kind of strict about what counts as a poem, thanks to reading way too many 'novels in verse'. If there isn't wordplay of some kind, imagery, or some really good metaphor or simile, it ain't a poem to me. It's the writer being pretentious. 
 So that's why this book frustrated me - for every smart, heartfelt, or well-written poem, there was one like ""On the Virg"" which read, in its entirety, ""I saw the Virgin Mary in my toast this morning. She was delicious."" Come on, Burnham. You weren't even trying on that one. Some of the other stuff is so GOOD and/or WITTY (talking about a fan aimed at a book that was ""blowing pages like a medieval prostitute,"" etc) that the lazy stuff and the cheap profanity was really annoying. I would definitely read more by him, but I hope there's a bit more quality control in the future. 
 Several of the poems would be great to use with kids and teens ""Magic,"" ""Homonyms,"" etc, but definitely don't give them the whole book, unless their parents are cool with them reading a poem called ""I fuck sluts"". Best for college kids and adults who remember Shel Silverstein fondly.""",2013-11-04 07:49:56,"Egghead: Or, You Can't Survive on Ideas Alone",poetry;non-fiction;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography,Bo Burnham;Chance Bone
907,8683812,4,"""A great read on Ernest Hemingway's marriage to Hadley. I listened to it on Audio and enjoyed it. The book is a great escape into the world of several expatriate writers in Paris in the 1920s. The author got the inspiration from the book when reading The Moveable Feast by Hemingway. I'm very interested in reading the books he wrote, that were written during the time period this book took place. It was a well written book and I liked Hadley's 'voice' in the book. 
  
 I found it really interesting that Hadley and Ernest had such parallel lives growing up. I think part of the reason that their marriage ended up the way it did was that Hadley refused to be like her mother, who was also like Ernest's mother. In some ways I admire that, however I would have fought a lot harder for my marriage. Yet, I see her wisdom in not trying with Ernest, and I'm not sure it would have made a difference with him. I think that based off of my limited knowledge of PTSD and his life he was suffering from it and it's too bad there wasn't knowledge/treatment of this back then because maybe his life would not have ended up the way it did. However, one cannot over look the historical prevalence of suicide and depression in his family. Very sad. 
 I also thought it was truly horrible the outcome of one very ambitious woman bent on wrecking a marriage. Pauline's character was just horrible and I am learning more and more about how women can be such a destructive force to a man. It's a very sad thing. It makes you value your marriage more and more and want to try and make it as strong as possible. It also makes you more aware & cautious of the people you let get close and have a part in your family life. 
 Scott and Zelda's characters were interesting, as well as all the other characters. Hadley was a wise woman I thought. Ernest, poor chap, was a fool to let her go.

I really like this comic book because I always wondered how Batman started out. I mean, I knew how movie-wise, but really reading them on the actual comics they were based on is a whole other experience. There is also an animated movie of the same name released just this year. I haven't watched it yet, but I heard it is faithful to the comic book. 
 You'll find in Batman: Year One Batman at the infancy of his planning stage. Eighteen years after his parents' death, the business empire heir thinks that he is now ready to ""clean up a city that likes being dirty"", the infamous Gotham City. The city really needed a hero at this time since it was wrought with crime and danger everywhere. This book also chronicles the life of Lieutenant Gordon, a detective, after his arrival to Gotham City and his interactions with the Dark Knight. I got so excited when I saw glimpses of of Catwoman (for her POV of the story, read Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper) and heard mention of the notorious Joker by the end . I really liked the story since it provides a good, solid background for people who want to know more about Batman. This is the first comic book I've read that was written by Frank Miller, and I can't wait to read more. 
 As I advanced through the pages, I couldn't help but admire the graphics as well. I mean, it's a comic book! I love the old-school feel of David Mazzucchelli's illustrations, reminiscent of the superhero comic strips in the comic sections of newspapers that I religiously followed as a child. 
 Even if it's more than two decades old, this book is a must-read for everyone, not just DC or Batman fans. It's easy to follow for new comic book readers, and if I'm not mistaken, I think this comes first if the Batman comics were to be read chronologically. I'm seriously considering buying the physical version of this book, not the digital comics, and hopefully the 4 issues instead of the compilation. I don't think it will come cheap though. Then again, for such a brilliant series, it deserves it. Let's support the comics industry!

918,13449677,3,"""What's up, people. Name's Dante. 
 Dante is a name you will not soon forget. Not because he's incredible or prodigious or fascinating. He is, however, a person with charms and that eventually grows on you. I'm in fact feeling the same exact thing for Rumpelstiltskin from Once Upon a Time, and we can agree that he, as a person, is not to be quite admired. 
 I am The Collector. 
 It's not as bad as it sounds. I'm kinda like Santa Claus. We're both jolly guys with a passion for frosted cookies, the color red...and sorting souls. 
 And he sure has an interesting sens of humour. 
 It's not the most well-written book on earth, that is evident but, still, is that always necessary, in order to enjoy a read? It was pleasant enough and it definitely did not bother my reading experience. Also, I a little expected it, since I've read Fire & Flood, by the same author, and was not impressed. At all. 
 This, though, was better than that dystopian story. Not only did it include multiple riveting characters, but it also had this light and credible nonetheless ambience that will only help you connect with the characters better and get invested in their story. 
 I look like a movie star and move like an athlete. 
 It's okay to be jealous, to covet me. 
 Now I'm not saying that the characters are perfect, because either they're flawed or stereotyped. It's just that they all had this suitable characteristic that added some pigment of originality in each one of them. Charlie is undeniably stereotyped to the max. Yet, she changed and grows and it won't matter anymore. Dante has in fact a character development as well, surprisingly. His personality did not bother me though so, even if he wouldn't have ended up having one, I would not have made a scene out of it. 
 ''You know why I'm the best collector? Because I know how to play games. I play to win. Understand? I do whatever it takes.'' 
 The setting is not very peculiar: it takes place in Alabama as well as in some high school Dante enrols in, in order to get closer to Charlie, whom is his assignment that will, once fulfilled, get him a promotion. Which he wants. Real bad. 
 The plot itself is quite simple. It has a spark of originality but you will certainly predict some events here and there. It wasn't a problem for me, since I mostly focused on the characters and their reaction to every single thing, they and I wonderfully clicked. And were really the ones making me enjoy this book. 
 I wish I could recommend this to everyone but, of what I see, this does not have a high rating average. So, I guess you shall decide if Dante is the kind of main character you would appreciate reading about--for entertainment, this is not what you probably call a 'serious' book.

921,13872,5,"""I bought this book somewhere in my travels around the country. I'm fairly certain I bought it on the East Coast (most of my West Coast books were bought at the same used bookstore in Poulsbo, WA, and were much more expensive than the mere $2 I bought this one for), but where it was that I got it, I have no recollection anymore. It languished on my shelves for years until a member of a reading group I belong to on Facebook mentioned that she was reading it and loving it. 
 I will now be forever beholden to that person. 
 This isn't a book for everyone. There's a lot in this book that will bother quite a few people (incest, sexuality, gore, violence, false prophets), but I adored it. The Binewskis are headed by Al, their father, who doses his wife Lil with various drugs in order to create freaks of their progeny for his carnival. Eventually they have Arty (born with flippers for arms and legs), Elly & Iffy (conjoined twins with two upper bodies and one lower one), Oly (an albino, humpbacked little person), and Chick (whose talents aren't readily apparent). At first we get the sense that this is a close-knit, loving family, one which has pulled inward due to the stares and comments they'd get from the ""norms"" outside. But it isn't long until the cracks in the familial relationships are revealed, and we see how weak this family, and its members, truly are. 
 Dunn masterfully weaves together the differing time periods in this book, from Oly's childhood to her adulthood, and it works so beautifully. The reader is then gifted with so much backstory and insight into what's going on now, which makes the story ever the richer. It's true that few of the characters in this book are even likable, but we understand to some degree why each character is as flawed as s/he is. And each one is drawn so vividly, and the writing is so rich, that for two nights I've had the most vivid dreams, sparked by reading this novel just before bed. 
 Another reviewer pointed out that the sparse detail regarding the firestorm seems out of place, considering how much time Dunn would spend on much less important events, but perhaps when one realizes that it's such a painful thing for Oly to think about, let alone write down, that Dunn felt that brevity would make the situation stronger. I personally would have wished for a bit more detail, but I can understand why she chose to nearly gloss over it. 
 I'm not entirely certain to whom I can recommend this book. Someone who isn't bothered by dark and twisted characters, for sure. Someone looking for something far out of the normal, definitely. Someone willing to be drawn down some harrowing paths, yes. But if that doesn't sound like something you would enjoy, I would probably steer clear of this book.""",2016-03-30 17:48:51,Geek Love,fiction;fantasy;paranormal,Katherine Dunn
922,19057,4,"""I absolutely adore Zusak's writing. It's so fresh and different and original. 
 Just a few of my favorite quotes: 
 When we move apart, she looks at me again till a small tear lifts itself up in her eye. It trips out to find a wrinkle and follows it down. (p. 51) 
 The kitchen light is loud. It deafens me as I walk toward it. (p. 114) 
 My words land on my feet and slip off to the grass. (p. 118) 
 A murmuring crawls to the window now, followed by a voice. (p. 142) 
 The glass in his eyes breaks and punctures me. (p. 143) 
 There are hot tears cooking on his face, and his eyes bite. (p. 170) 
 Just for now, I find I'm happy, and I want to stay awake, but soon the night falls down, beating me hard into sleep. (p. 235) 
 It makes his writing so very evocative and strong, and it makes me feel almost as if I want to wrap myself up in his words in hopes they'll keep me warm. 
 So Zusak's prose really does it for me. But while I loved the book, and I loved the way in which Ed Kennedy grew and matured throughout the novel, I am not sure I liked the end. It seemed to be almost a cop-out. The message is a good one, for sure, but it left me wanting more. Had I thought about it, I would have come up with that ending, but I had dismissed it as being too trite and cliche. It was very disappointing.

 It's rare, but it occasionally happens. I just finished reading a thing of beauty. My heart still kind of hurts because it still needs to settle from it all, but it also feels full and happy. 
 Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I think I'm in love with Kandi Steiner. 
 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
 I really don't know how to properly express just how moved I was by this book. I'm going to keep it short and simple, because this is a story that you need to experience with a clear head and feel your way through it on your own. 
 This has been one of the most emotional, angst-ridden books I've ever read. A favorite of the year, and of all time. I loved the smooth transitions throughout the character's lives. I was utterly enraptured by the lyrical prose. I enjoyed every moment with the flawed Jamie and B; the highs and the lows. ""Whiskey"" may be a man, but he's just as addictive as the drink itself. If not, more! 
 To simplify this book, I could describe it as a complicated friends-to-lovers romance that spans over more than a decade. But I would be doing it a great disservice to not explicitly point out that this complex and raw, love story goes beyond that. 
 I read this book ever so slowly, taking in and savoring every single drop. I stressed over the characters, and I sobbed when fate dealt them a shitty hand. It was difficult to read the moments in which they were so close, then life took a sudden turn, yet I loved every word. Their chemistry and bond was all-consuming, their friendship intoxicating. It was all overwhelming in the best way. 
 The ending, which reveals a genius concept, really took this masterpiece to a whole other level. A Love Letter to Whiskey left me with a glorious aftertaste. I'm whiskey wasted and it feels so good.""",2016-09-29 20:09:35,A Love Letter to Whiskey,romance;young-adult,Kandi Steiner
933,8683812,4,"""Poor dear, Hadley! 
 This book just makes me pity her so. It made me angry that she didn't stand up for herself more. 
 Hadley came off as a bit dull, or perhaps just tame, at least for Ernest's lifestyle. I'm surprised she caught his interest at all. Clearly, he saw something in her! 
 He treated her so badly that I almost couldn't bear to continue the story. There were a few times where I saw the love between them, but more often than not, the love seemed one-sided. 
 McLain did a swell job of voicing Hadley and getting the emotions across. When the affair was exposed, I cried and my heart wrenched for her. 
 I kept waiting for Hadley to blow up at Ernest, but once she did, she apologized. It's hard to believe that this woman wasn't strong enough to put her foot down. Or that she would let those things happen to her. 
 Another thing that McLain did beautifully was depicting post-war Paris. The writing flowed effortlessly and I felt as if I was transported to that time and place. I also really enjoyed the Hemingway's pals and the dynamic between them all. 
 Ernest Hemingway is one of my all time favorite writers, sadly this particular novel makes me loathe the man. Both for his cowardice and betrayal. Regardless, he's still a genius and I will continue to admire his work.

941,21823465,3,"""I acquired this volume, along with the first volume of several other comics, as part of the Humble Image Comics Bundle. I find it hard to review these volumes. They are over so quickly; I think I'd go nuts reading issue to issue! In part I know I must review them based on my enjoyment of the volume, but since these works are all stepping off points to grander stories and adventures, I must also account for how well the comic got its hooks into me. 
 Alex + Ada, Volume 1, even more than the first volume of most comics, is all exposition. Alex's life is pretty boring (which is why his rich Grandma buys him an android), and non-sentient android Ada is boring as well (which Alex can't abide). So how did Alex + Ada get me interested in coming back for more? 
 Take the fictional worlds of the great Isaac Asimov, where AI is cornerstone of future society, and move them to a more contemporary version future society, with smart phones embedded in your brain and fully autonomous cars, and you have the world of Alex + Ada. Is it strikingly original? No. But it asks the same questions as Asimov, questions that I always find fascinating: What would the world be like with artificial intelligence? How will governments, corporations, and individuals respond to the realities and anxieties of such a world? What do we owe our robotic creations as they acquire sentience? 
 Alex + Ada Volume 1, expositional as it is, merely hints at how it might try to answer these questions, but those hints, like a society increasingly fearful of androids in the wake of an unexplained massacre, and a secret collective of android sympathizers  are compelling enough that I want to see where the authors take it.""",2015-01-18 10:43:21,"Alex + Ada, Vol. 1",comics;graphic;fiction;romance;fantasy;paranormal;young-adult,Jonathan Luna;Sarah Vaughn

Her rickety old father, Gerlof, the stubbornest resident in the old folks' home where he now lives, has been sent a sandal that looks like one of the pair Jens was wearing the day he vanished. After one of Gerlof's equally antiquated friends is murdered, Gerlof and his friends redouble their efforts to find out what went on -- and what's still going on. Julia, initially reluctant, starts to become diligent in the quest as well, aided by a growing affection for local cop Lennart. Everything seems to center on the fate of Nils Kant, a spoilt child of privilege who, at the end of the war, murdered two German soldiers and a policeman, thereafter fleeing to South America, where he died. Or did he? 
 The latter stages of this book -- including a denouement that completely bowled me over -- are riveting stuff, and there's some wonderfully suspenseful stuff earlier on, too. I also liked very much the integration of past events with present ones; there's a real sense of story in the text. There are some irritations, though: occasionally there are intrusions -- to no good or useful purpose, and certainly of no relevance to the plot -- of the supernatural (I've no idea why Theorin did this); and once or twice the author plays the annoying trick of telling a character an important datum but then coyly refusing for a few pages to let us in on the secret -- a completely artificial way of attempting to ratchet up tension. There's also something on the second last page that makes no sense at all (but don't go looking, or you'll really spoil the book for yourself!).

It's about a young Irish girl, Eilis, who goes to America to find work and a better life, falls in love, and has to decide between two men. It's conventional, almost bland. 
 While most of the novel takes place in Brooklyn, Eilis hardly seems to notice anything going on around her and is only a tangential observer to the social changes occurring all around her, such as when coloured customers are allowed into her store for the first time. No attention is drawn to the setting, despite the title of the book, and Eilis could just as well be in any major city in the Western hemisphere. That is to say, her time in New York is a blur, as she herself observes when she briefly returns to Ireland, where the author suddenly comes back to life and creates lush soundscapes of beaches and cliffs and rain, a hundred times more alive and more spirited than before. Colm Toibin is himself Irish, and apparently the village described in the book is where he was born. His love for it is apparent, and brilliant to read, like watercolours on a page. 
 I was going to give this three stars, but have decided to add a bonus star because while it sticks to conventional tropes and well-worn plotlines, it does so with confidence and something that can only be described as precision. It's a short book and nary a sentence is wasted - everything drives home a point, or a detail about the characters. Apparently I liked this more than I thought I did because I've written such a long review.

 Masked Innocence (5 stars, Book 2) Julia has given Brad's sexual orientation a try & she found herself intrigued by it. I am not exactly a big fan of menages & sex fests but I might just change my tune when it comes to Alessandra Torre. It's done tastefully... like an art. Boy, was it scorching! Panty melting! *fans self* 
 Brad & Julia are taking things to the next level... a committed relationship, complete with a questionnaire! 
 Julia gives as good as she gets. She pushes & challenges Brad. She fell hard on the process but so did he. He just didn't know it yet. 
 Brad 
 ""I fell for the feisty, smart-ass Julia that calls me on my shit. But I'm owned by the vixen that you become behind closed doors."" 
 Julia 
 ""I believe I said I don't care if you don't love me right now. You will fall in love with me."" 
 Brad 
 ""Why are you so certain I will fall in love with you?"" 
 Julia 
 ""You just met me. I've had over twenty years to get to know me. Trust me, you will. You're too smart not to."" 
 She's the perfect match for this cocky, self assured, so full of himself man! Love her spunk & personality! And honestly, who can resist Brad??? He's every woman's wet dream come true. 
 ""Julia, you are incomparable. I know what I risk in straying from you, what I would lose if you left me. I promise to never kiss, caress or fuck another woman without you there, watching it happen. And I promise to allow you to be as unfaithful as you want, as long as I am there to make sure you're satisfied."" SEE??? *snort* *sigh* 
 The plot intensifies when Julia's boss got murdered & she's caught in the middle of it. Brad is faced with the fact that Julia means more to him than he thought possible. And that he would do everything to save her. Even if it means he would have to go face the past he turned away from. Even if it means marriage... 
 End of Innocence (5 stars, Book 3) Julia & Brad are engaged but Julia asked for a year to get to know him & see if things could really work out for them. More kinks & yummy hotness! 
 This was an intense read. We get to see Brad's anxiety over Julia's predicament, the evolvement of their relationship, sexual tensions & doubts, getting to know the family, besties & Martha, the force of Brad's household (adored her!). It was a mess of a lot of things and I loved it! The strength of their love & trust gets tested. I was biting my fingers towards 80% of the book, so thrilling! Loved the twists. 
 ""You won't understand... unless you come close to losing me, you will never understand the black hole that my soul became when I thought you were gone. I hope you never understand the depth of love you have for me, I hope your heart is never pushed off that cliff. Just know that I am forever yours. 
 I would have loved more from the ending. I wasn't ready to part with Brad & Julia just yet. I'm having withdrawals. Even until now, I want more. Can't get enough. 
 Unpredictable, fast-paced, suspenseful, breathtakingly beautiful! Loved this series!

966,14069,4,"""Where the first book was a rollicking adventure with naval fights and an origin story in which you are getting to know Capt. Laurence and Temeraire, this was more of a study in relationships between humans and dragons, and just as importantly, between countries. Politics and diplomatic relations play a HUGE role in this book, so if you're looking for as much or more action than the first one, slow your roll, bud. There are some tense and suspenseful scenes, and there are action-filled scenes, but nowhere to the amount in the first book. Laurence is pushed from his usual role as Captain to bystander and must navigate the line between staying friendly with China and keeping his dragon. 
 Seeing how China views and uses dragons puts into perspective the different cultures and values of Britain and China. China's independence allows them to employ dragons less for war and more for companionship or work in the city. They also value dragons and allow them more independence, which increases tension between Laurence and Temeraire. 
 If you like thee politics or sly navigations of Game Thrones, a la Tyrion Lannister, more than action or war, then this book is perfect for you. However, though it wasn't as much innocent fun as the first, it was still extremely enjoyable and intricate.

967,14064,3,"""If you haven't already heard this, I'm going to put in a fact: THIS BOOK IS NOT LIKE THE MOVIE. I saw the movie first, so who knows if I would like to book more than the movie had I read the book first, but as of right now, I like the movie more. 
 First of all, in terms of tension, there's very little. I'm in a creative writing class right now, and one of the hardest situations to insert tension is a story of a person by themselves and their thoughts. Robert Neville is alone for most of the book, and sometimes his thoughts contradict themselves to give you that contrary position to start arguments, but they're rare. Most of the book consists of Robert Neville trying to figure out the cure, getting angry with himself and smashing things and fixing his house. Pretty dull. There were a few moments I was hooked, but considering the subject matter, I expected more. 
 The differences (which in my opinion make the book less good. Not worse. Just less good): 
 -The dog has a tiny, short part in the book. The presence of the dog gives Neville a reason to live and care for another creature, which in turn causes audiences to be empathetic toward him. 
 -The antagonists are vampires. Straight up vampires, not even close to zombie-like. In fact, many of them can even talk. And for most of the book they're either sleeping during the day or wandering outside of his house, trying to entice Neville out it. 
 -The book focuses very heavily on 
 -Neville is an angsty, grumpy and cold 40-year-old man with blonde hair and blue eyes. Personally, I like that they cast Will Smith as Neville. Why everyone needs to be blonde and blue-eyed is beyond me. I mean, it probably would have been fine had they cast a Caucasian, but I like Will Smith a lot, so no complaints from me. 
 -The end is preettyy different. I won't spoil anything, but it is so different than the movie, which changes the message for each medium. This deals more with the question: what is humanity? 
 I could have done without all the moping and grumbling from Neville. I understand that it is a natural reaction to a plague, I do. It's not going to evoke any sympathy, though. He's annoying. He complains. He contemplates his existence. He contemplates the existence of others like him. He throws things a lot. It was like the scene from Order of the Phoenix when Harry starts screaming and throwing things, BUT FOR AN ENTIRE BOOK. Less angst, please. 
 I will give it some leeway, considering it was written in the 60s (I think), but there could have been way more tension, energy, character development and character distinguishing. Seriously. At one point, he interacts with another talking character and THEY SOUND THE SAME. The way they speak is way too alike. But, if you want to read it for its historical context or literary presence, feel free.""",2014-02-25 17:40:41,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson
968,17333426,5,"""It was only a matter of time before Bo Burnham wrote poetry. He was practically already there. And this book of poetry is what you'd expect of a teenage YouTube star whose main claim to fame is writing politically incorrect songs and jokes. Some of his poetry is crass, risque or shocking. If that's what you like, then don't worry, you will find it in this book of poetry. 
 However, Burnham also displays some incredibly beautiful (and sometimes downright bizarre) writing in Egghead. Take, for instance, my favorite: 
 ""I love you just the way are 
 but you don't see like I do. 
 You shouldn't try so hard to be perfect. 
 Trust me, perfect should try to be you."" 
 It is poems like these, simple yet beautiful and candid, that truly display Burham's capacity for austere stunning-ness. If you only like these types of poems, then it is worth it to skip the ones you find offensive if just to read and remember words like these. 
 Burnham comes full circle with his truly incredible wit. He is sharp, funny and rhythmic. 
 ""She could light up a room with her smile. 
 And she could really light one up with her flamethrower."" 
 I wish i studied comedy or poetry just to know what this technique is called. Misdirection, perhaps? My literary journalism professor would call it ""striking juxtaposition"". He starts in a way that you expect lyrical language and an ode to some girl's beauty, then flips 180 degrees and with a play on words, goes a completely opposite direction that he hopes you didn't expect. And Burnham loves doing that. For instance: 
 ""'No one understands me' 
 it slipped out in 
 a timid whisper 
 as she combed her beard."" 
 My absolute favorite witty ones are those with puns and different homonyms. 
 ""Since both of us couldn't have you, one of us had to halve you."" 
 ""Sully suffers from a stutter, 
 simple syllables will clutter, 
 stalling speeches up on beaches 
 like a sunken sailboat rudder. 
 Sully strains to say his phrases, 
 sickened by the sounds he raises, 
 strings of thoughts come out in knots, 
 he solves his sentences like mazes. 
 At night, he writes his thoughts instead 
 and sighs as they steadily rush from his head."" 
 ""My daughter, on her teeter-totter, slaughtered the fresh water otter I brought her. 
 Just like I taught her."" 
 If you're a fan of slam poetry like this that occasionally touches on a serious subject (but usually serves to entertain, offend, shock or confuse), and especially if you're a fan of Bo Burnham, then you'd like this book.""",2013-11-22 17:40:05,"Egghead: Or, You Can't Survive on Ideas Alone",poetry;non-fiction;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography,Bo Burnham;Chance Bone

 In general, this book was not horrible. It was a solid three stars for most of the novel. I liked the idea of being given anonymous tips about people you could help in some way. I liked that Ed was asked to tread in morally gray areas, right up to being asked to maybe kill someone. 
 The protagonist was difficult to connect to, though, which kept me from really investing in the book, despite it's interesting premise, and by the time we got to Hearts, I was ready for the book to just be over already. I felt like Ed spent a lot of his time hemming and hawing and talking about how he was putting off doing the thing he was supposed to do because he was so scared of what he'd find.

976,7095054,3,"""It's the first half of Alice's senior year, and her job as features editor of the school paper has her investigating a neo-Nazi group in the school. Though she still has an ""understanding"" with Patrick, who's away at college, she goes to a dance with a new student, a Sudanese refugee. And she helps ex-special ed friend Amy Sheldon deal with a difficult problem when Amy is molested by a teacher . 
 Like all latter Alice books, the writing is fairly tortured and the book is longer, more meandering, and dull than the earlier, middle school era books. However, the three main storylines worked fairly well together, and their weight gave some welcome seriousness and momentum to this volume. With its emphasis on racism at school, there were some echos of the great Alice on the Outside, although I still think that is a better book. 
 Stray Observations 
  
 - I would have liked Daniel Bul Dau to be a bigger character and for Alice to be more interested in him. I was excited when he asked her out, but really she only goes to the dance with him as a friend, she doesn't really date him per se. The book is kind of condescending about him, really. He's constantly cheerful and amazed, the perfect grateful refugee. I would have liked to see him have more of a personality beyond his refugee status. 
 - There's an amusing sequence where Alice convinces Lester to take her on a whirlwind college visit weekend, and in a realistic way, through her lack of planning/understanding how this works, she winds up not really seeing anything of value. She uses the wrong map, can't find a place to stay, etc. I actually feel like it's a very accurate representation of the futility of college visits: you get there, you're not really sure what you're supposed to be seeing, you just kind of walk around, you end up applying to the schools that gave you a vague ""good feeling"" (i.e. you were well rested and the weather was nice when you were there). 
 - I like that Alice and her friends decided to trade dresses instead of buying something new for the dance - very frugal and sensible in a realistic Millennial way - but I'm disappointed in her decision to write it up for the paper as a hot new trend, complete with photo of herself, Liz, Pam, and Gwen in each other's dresses (which, to everyone else, would just look like girls wearing dresses: there's nothing inherently ""traded-looking"" about them). When she got the features editor gig in Almost Alice, much was made of Alice being superior at the job because she focuses her features on other people, not herself; now it seems she's going the Jacki Severn route and just spamming the paper with vanity puff pieces on herself and her friends. 
 - The big conflict in this book comes when Alice is the last person to put the paper to bed, and she slips in coverage of Amy's accusation against her molester. Alice is afraid that if she doesn't make it public, the guy will weasel out of it. The faculty adviser is hugely disappointed in Alice, because she essentially accused someone without a fair trial, and she didn't run it by anyone else on staff first. It's actually a pretty interesting question of journalistic ethics... though of course it ends up reinforcing this pattern in Alice books, where it turns out the students are too quick to protest/argue/be suspicious, and faculty is on top of the problem all along! All acts of defiance against the school administration end up being super anticlimactic. I mean, yes, the molesting teacher is guilty, but the principal dealt with it quickly, and Alice was Wrong to Mistrust. Just once, I'd like to see the students come up against the faculty in a real fight. 
 - It's worth noting in this racism-centric volume that Alice pointedly doesn't recognize her white privilege at any point. Near the end, understandably terrified to run into a group of neo-Nazis in an empty lot, she thinks of herself as ""everything [the group] is against,"" because they know she has lesbian friends and dated a black guy. She doesn't stop and think how much worse it would be for her if she WAS gay or black in this moment. 
 - Curtis Butler's diatribe in the school paper seemed like a reasonable approximation of what a neo-Nazi teen might write when challenged to ""keep it clean"": no outright slurs, still repugnant views, clearly mostly memorized and jumbled and spewed back from a bunch of online sources. The paper definitely treated its printing with kid gloves, with both a forward by Alice AND an afterward by the school advisor, each stressing that Curtis's views are his own and they're only publishing it to get the undercurrent of anger out in the open. One or the other would have been better, I think; when the word count of all the caveats and disclaimers rivals the word count of the actual piece, it feels like they're not really giving Curtis the fair chance that he was promised. 
 - I like that Curtis never really ""reforms"" - he seems to grow disillusioned with his neo-Nazi mentor, but not because he's learning to be less racist. He sort of continues to be racist but is less interested in putting himself on the line about his views. I thought it was interesting when Alice saw a glimpse of his home life (as a customer at his family's gas station), and his dad was razzing him for not being manly enough. It felt like a plausible explanation for why Curtis would glom onto the nearest underground paramilitary group. 
 - Alice finishes up the book by publishing her much-delayed tribute to Mark. It is the most damning-with-faint-praise tribute I have ever read. I am so insulted on Mark's behalf. It really couldn't be worse.

977,77604,4,"""Somehow I'd never heard of Nero Wolfe until recently. A friend and fellow fan of the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries told me it was her favorite series, and I had to read it. It did not disappoint! Rex Stout is such an alarmingly good writer that every other book is noticeably bad after reading this. I can't even explain it. Archie's internal monologue is both informal and poetic, full of weird and evocative metaphor. I love the idea of a hermit detective who never leaves his house. There's often one episode or book in a detective series where the detective is laid up or trapped somewhere and must solve the mystery using only the power of his mind, and EVERY BOOK is like that with Nero Wolfe. Also interesting: the constant tension between decadent wealth and the ever-present threat of poverty in 1930s NYC. 
 This particular novel is somewhat gimmicky and involves a weird invention but the process of solving it is so good that it almost sells you on the ridiculousness.""",2015-05-22 11:37:43,"Fer-de-Lance (Nero Wolfe, #1)",mystery;thriller;crime;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography,Rex Stout;Loren D.

 Frankly, an impulse buy. Even more frankly, an impulse buy that I have a hard time feeling guilty about because it was so good. Those who have heard of Bo Burnham know that he's a comedian with a raunchy twenty-something style. You might know him from YouTube or his released touring one man show ""what."" yet sadly not nearly enough people do. Characteristic of nearly every single one of my obsessions, Bo uses humor to get the audience's attention, then throws in a strikingly real and profound thread every now and then, bouncing the two back and forth until they combine into something incredibly accessible and meaningful. Word of warning for some: if you're not a fan of crude or profane humor, this is not the stuff for you. That being said, I can't imagine anyone who makes it past that point not enjoying or gaining something from this collection of poems. I read this, embarrassingly, while sitting in the passenger seat next to my father on the way to visit his parents - not recommended. I ended up angling the pages away from his line of sight but still responding with a deep blush every now and then. Yes, Egghead will make you blush, especially if you read it around other people. After a few pages of attempting only silent laughter, I found myself laughing as openly as I would at a live show. Seriously. There are even a few poems that I read aloud to my dad because I loved them so much, for instance: 
 Boston Poem 
 The Boston people pass the time 
 by making all their stories rhyme. 
 Like, ""Yesterday, me and my ma 
 watched the Sox game at the bar."" 
 A little bit of Bostonian humor from a Bostonian. This book now sits on my coffee table, easily accessible for me to flip through whenever I feel like doing so. Anyone who may be on the fence about buying or reading this: you should. Everyone should! I want everyone to experience that Bo-Burnham-gut-wrench upon reading a poem and waiting for the punchline, only to find out that there isn't one - and then it just blows your mind how true the words ring.""",2014-12-31 14:52:43,"Egghead: Or, You Can't Survive on Ideas Alone",poetry;non-fiction;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography,Bo Burnham;Chance Bone

 And you know what? The book doesn't even need that. 
 It has a completely new and different world that feels like you could easily step in it and live there for the rest of your life, that's how vividly and realisticly written it is. And with that great and amazing world comes a greatly written, interesting, and totally realistic hero who tells his life story in the course of three days. 
 It isn't a fairytale. It's not a sugarcoated tale about a hero, who goes and saves the world and then gets the girl and even makes it home by supper. Kvothe had his fair share of bad and good life experiences, and he tells us as it was, in it raw, absolutely true way, which is pretty cool. You weep with/for him, you laugh with him and everything in between as he tells the first third of his story throughout this book and the more you read, the more you actually want. 
 I don't actually wanna say too much, I think this is the book that you should experience for yourself without as much knowledge as possible. It'll make the journey so much more fun. 
 I'll tell you this, thought. You know that warm, homey feeling that you get from very few books you read over your life? That feeling that when you're reading the book, you feel like you're sitting under the Christmas tree with a hot chocolate and simply spend the whole day reading? I got that feeling reading this book, which is astonishing, considering the fact that I only ever got this feeling with Harry Potter before. 
 So yeah, this is easily one of the best books I've read in 2016 so far, will definitely continue with The Wise Man's Fear soon and if you haven't read this masterpiece, you should.

 Dead sexy Dragons is a new dragon shapeshifter series that falls into the Paranormal Erotica category. When I first saw the cover (total eye candy) and the author name (Lolita) I kind of knew what type of book this was going to be, but my love of dragons had me looking forward to this one anyway. 
 In the beginning of the story when the Stig was trying to avoid Cora, I was thinking things might be get really hot before they were lead to the bedroom, but I was kind of wrong. I say kind of because the first sex scene happened in a dream not in reality. But she was in her bed, so it kind of counts. Then in the dungeon, which isn't really a bed but it is where Stig was at the time. So it was kind of his bedroom. 
 There were many different interesting things happening that would have been cool if they were explored more in depth (besides the sex) but I think the author left those details for another story. This story gave enough of a whiff of chocolate to get you interested if this is your kind of thing or to let you move on if it wasn't. 
 Even though this was a short story (97 pages) there were at least 4 different descriptive sex scenes between our main characters. So if you're not into that type story, you may want to stay clear of this book.

 Not quite what I was expecting from something I believed was a new standalone. It takes place after Tristan & Danika but before The Wild Side series. I'm pretty sure every single RK Lilley character makes an appearance at SOME point in the book. It was confusing at times, even for me who knew who all the characters were. If this is your first RK book you'd likely be lost. Totally gives away the Wild Side story as well. So if you haven't read that and don't want it spoiled, then skip this until after. 
 The Other Man is a bit of a trip and mind fuck- but in a good way. I'm nit picky, so here goes: 
 Heath: I'm not so sure about him. His demeanor seemed to change at one point and there was no real explanation as to why and I couldn't really pinpoint any valid reason for such a change. Kevin: he's totally predictable. But that's not always a bad thing. Lourdes: I like her, quite a bit, but I do wish she'd stand up to Heath more. I also would have liked more closure with the Lisa thing. I still felt like there was more to know.

 There are so many characters in this series, but each and every one of them gets a unique purpose gifted to them by Shusterman. There were many POVs too and I really enjoyed the way the story was told. This is series here is made of outstanding storytelling. I also noticed that Shusterman writes in 3rd Person present tense, which isn't quite the classic POV and tense for novels, but it really fit the momentum. The weird thing is that I have the feeling as if knowing the characters well, but at the same time still think them quite far away or as strangers. I'm not sure why it is like that. 
 The real news articles at the beginning of each part were eye-opening and very befitting as always. I simply love this series so much, so I think it could have been even bigger, greater and better. Overly-high-expectations-syndrome probably haha 
 At one point in this novel everything just goes wrong for our protagonists, it was truly heart-wrenching. And then what everyone goes through! There are some bone-chilling scenes as always, the creepiness factor is still there. 
 I simply find the concept of the Unwind Series so amazing because it could really become the future, it may be even starting now as the news articles suggest. 
 I would have loved to spend more time with some of the characters, but because so many POVs were playing into this, everyone's personal story couldn't be too long and everything plotwise must have been planned meticulously. On my account, the book could have been far longer and I would have still devoured it.

 I don't really know what expectations I had for this book. I had LOVED The Book Thief. It was moving, felt real honest, and unique. I guess I think maybe my only expectation for this book was to be moved. 
 The general storyline was intriguing enough. Our ordinary ""hero"" Ed finds himself smack dab in the middle of a bank robbery along with a couple of his smart ass friends. After this incident he finds his world rocked when a mysterious playing card shows up at his door with 3 names and addresses on them. And there begins his journey as ""the messenger"".. 
 As the messenger, his life intersects with strangers and familiar people alike that he must figure out what message he needs to deliver each particular person. Some of his messages are quite easy to figure out while others even put him in danger. And meanwhile, the question still remains, as to who the mysterious person is that is behind the cards. 
 Zusack manages to deliver a moving story that becomes the ultimate message, in my opinion, for humanity. I feel like sometimes I need a good reminder that anyone, no matter how ordinary you are, can do something good to help someone and that it is just a matter of having the confidence in yourself to do so. 
 I loved the development of Ed throughout the story. I loved seeing the confidence he gained with each message and I loved how he handled what he gained from each person that he touched.

 A word of warning (several, actually) for those who are familiar only with the contemporary meaning of the word ""geek."" Before the word had its DNA mutated to mean ""an expert,"" particularly of the techie variety, before serious people proclaimed that the geeks will inherit the earth, the word referred specifically to carnival performers who engaged in the very un-nerdy practice of biting the heads off live chickens for paying audiences. Let's see a show of hands.

 Binewski's Carnival Fabulon travels the Podunk USA circuit, offering pedestrian locals a peek at the extraordinary. The Binewski family will remind no one of Ozzie and Harriet. More the Addams family, sans the smirks. In fact, they may be the ones who put the nuclear in nuclear family. Frustrated by the frequent loss of carnival performers, Aloysius Binewski and his wife, Lilian Hinchcliff Binewski , (the Crystal Lil of the geek mention above) opt to craft their own, applying measured doses of sundry illegal substances, poisons, and radioisotopes to ensure that their progeny emerge special. The efforts that do not make it through to live birth, or who meet an unhappy end soon after their emergence, are displayed publicly in large glass jars. The survivors include Siamese twins, Iphigenia (Iphy) and Elektra (Elly), Arturo (Arty), the malevolent and megalomaniacal AquaBoy, Fortunato (Chick), who manifests telekinetic power, and Olympia (Oly), our narrator through this family saga. Oly relates the tale of the family to us as an adult. She makes a living as radio personality Hopalong McGurk, which is a good venue if you are a bald, albino dwarf with pink eyes, a sweet voice and a hump. 
 Reading this book you will forget the boy who lived under the stairs and latch on to the girl who lived under the sink. Oly's needs are few, but a connection to family is chief among them. She is our insider, observing and reporting the goings on that seem normal to her, but maybe not so much to us. What is normal, anyway? To you and me, norms for the most part, average height, weight, a typical number of standard-issue limbs, no particular magical powers, we stroll the not very broad midway of the straight and narrow. But to Olympia Binewski, having a brother with flipper-shaped limbs, twins sharing one pair of legs, among sundry other parts, and a brother who can move matter with his mind, and a sense of place defined by the nearest road sign defines normal. 
 I was full-grown before I even set foot in a house without wheels. Of course I had been in stores, offices, fuel stations, barns, and warehouses. But I had never walked through the door of a place where people slept and ate and bathed and picked their noses, and, as the saying goes,""lived,"" unless that place was three times longer than it was wide and came equipped with road shocks and tires. 
 When I first stood in such a house I was struck by its terrible solidity. The thing had concrete tentacles sunk into the earth, and a sprawling inefficiency. Everything was bigger than it needed to be and there were so many shadowed, dusty corners empty and wasted that I thought I would get lost if I stepped away from the door. That building wasn't going anywhere despite an itchy sense that it was not entirely comfortable where it was. 
 Sometimes that family connection can be problematic. Oly is in love with her brother, Arty. AquaBoy is exceptionally bright and tuned in to what works on audiences. He expands his performance from a display of his unusual form to an interaction, as he finds success answering audience questions. He builds this into a very big deal 
 For a while, he answered only generic questions distilled from the scrawled bewilderments and griefs that piled up on the three-by-five cards. Then he stopped answering at all and just told them what he wanted them to hear. Testifying he called it. 
 And a cult is born, Arturism, in which the Admitted, seeking to find the peace that Arty has persuaded them he possesses, allow their bodies to be whittled a piece at a time. 
 Chick was thought to have been a dreaded norm when he arrived. Al and Lily decided that, as he was of no value to the show, the proper course was to leave him at a gas station. Turns out he has a special gift which manifests in the nick of time. He is absorbed into the family, and put to profitable use as soon as he is able to understand commands. 
 We follow the family as the children grow, and as will happen, sexuality swells the narrative mix. Complications ensue. 
 These are not exactly the nicest people, but Dunn offers nuanced portrayals of most of them. We never really find out why Boston Brahmin Lily chooses the low road, but we do see both the dark and the light sides of their children. Or in the case of Arty, the bright side illuminating his dark side. Oly is a sympathetic character and you will have little trouble appreciating her concerns, particularly when she is an adult. Her role, though, is primarily as an observer. Chick is like a wounded animal, who, despite his prodigious power, suffers as he feels the pain all around him. The twins have the same problems other twins experience, on steroids. There are a few outsiders who join the Fabulon, and offer a perspective other than Oly's. 
 The narrative follows two time lines. The bulk is following the traveling Binewkis over a decade or so. The smaller narrative is Oly as an adult, living in a boarding house in which her mother and her daughter, Miranda, (a Tempest reference if ever there was one, resonant with the opening epigraph, taken from that play), reside. In that stream Mary Malley Lick is a wealthy heiress who professes a desire to liberate young women from the burden of being attractive so they can make their way in the world on their merits. Of course, the very large and not very attractive Ms Lick may be using her great wealth to take beauty away from those who have it, in a form of one-percenter jealousy. Oly takes an interest in her when Lick targets Miranda. 
 The tales of love, greed, power, envy, powerlessness and rage seem the stuff of Greek or Shakespearean tragedy, particularly those centering around Arty. Hubris, abuse of power, fate and comeuppance are most definitely on display. 
 There are really two primary preoccupations of mine involved in this book. One of course is this concept of the cult, and the how-come of that. And the other was the long debate of nature vs. nurture. So those two things linked and seemed to be in an odd way part and parcel of each other, I guess. 
 We are asked to look at questions about the definition of normalcy. Most of the time in literature the freaks want to be like everyone else. Here the norms seem to pine for freakishness. Dunn offers a fascinating comparison between the oddness of the Arturists and what society considers appropriate. 
 It's interesting that when these individuals choose--and it is their choice always--to endure voluntary amputation for their own personal benefit, society professes itself shocked and disapproving. Yet this same society respects the concept that any individual should risk total annihilation in war, subject to the judgment of any superior officer at all and for purposes ranging from a promotion for the lieutenant to higher profits for the bullet company. Hell, they don't just respect that idea, they flat expect it. And they'll shoot your ass if you don't go along with it. 
 At what point does cultishness, do the needs of the pack, become the norm? 
 In addition to the startling tale of the Binewskis, Dunn demonstrates a particularly powerful and poetic command of language. Here is a small sample: 
 The sky above Molalla was aching blue but I walked from Arty's tent to our van in the same air I'd sucked all my life. It was a Binewski blend of lube, grease, dust, popcorn, and hot sugar. We made that air and we carried it with us. The Fabulon's light was the same in Arkansas as in Idaho--the patented electric dance step of the Binewskis. We made it. Like the mucoid nubbin that spins a shell called ""oyster,"" we Binewskis wove a midway shelter called ""carnival."" 
 There is plenty more where that came from. There is also serious structural craft on display, as Dunn, in this modern fable, wields parallelism deftly, particularly as applied to how people are formed and changed, and the diverse motivations, self and external, involved in the formation of who we are and what we are capable of, for good and ill. There is a particularly poignant look at innocence in childhood vs adulthood. 
 Appropriately for a book that concerns freakishness, Geek Love is notable for its packaging. Quick, name five books that are renowned for their covers. Right. Dead air, that's what I thought. Ok, Ok, Gatsby, and we all have personal favorites, but how many are really different, and universally regarded as groundbreaking? The Knopf wolfhound on the bound edge of the original hard-cover printing somehow sports five instead of the usual four limbs. And the letters used in the cover title are all mutations. It was considered pretty daring cover art for the time. 
 One of the inspirations for the story took place in Portland, Oregon. The International Rose Test Garden in Washington Park is home to a wide variety of rose variations. Dunn wondered how it might play out if people were applying genetic control to making people, not in some sort of Aryan quest for perfection, but in trying to design for different. She was also inspired, if the word can be used here, by the awfulness of Jim Jones, and puts some of Jones's words into Arty's mouth. Dunn is from Kansas, originally, but her family moved around a fair bit when she was a kid. She has lived in several European countries, having her son in Ireland, but lives in Portland now, where she has become a renowned writer on boxing. 
 As for film plans for Geek Love, rights have been sold and sold again, but now reside permanently with Warner Brothers, who may or may not ever get around to producing it. 
 Geek Love has been continuously in print since its' 1989 release. In fact she earned more money from it in the last year than she ever had before. The author was given a contract for a second novel, for a sum well into six figures. But the book has yet to appear. Perhaps it is in a glass jar somewhere. 
 You don't have to be a teenager or twenty-something to appreciate the pull of Geek Love. It is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read, and I am well on my way to geezerhood. Reading Geek Love may not alter your DNA, give you unusual physical characteristics or make sleeping under the kitchen sink seem appealing. But it will definitely alter your view of what is possible in literature, will make you think about some core subjects in ways that might not have occurred before and will make you perk up whenever you spot one or more of the many references to it that pop up in our culture from time to time, like a travelling carnival. It may be too out there for some readers, but I suggest that if it feels that way to you, take an excursion and go out there to see this amazing show. It is one of the best freakin' books ever.

1008,4954833,4,"""Brooklyn is a wonderful character portrait and captures as well the struggle of an Irish immigrant to the US in the post war world. Eilis Lacy is a twenty-something in a small Irish town, frustrated at the sclerotic nature of her environment. Her life lies ahead of her in a single, entirely predictable line and she feels suffocated. She wants to study, to learn accountancy, or at least bookkeeping, so she can rise a little above her lowly economic situation. Seizing an unexpected opportunity she sails for America and begins to make a life for herself in Brooklyn. 
 Colm Toibin - from the LA Times 
 Toibin finds small-townishness, of the good-and-warm but also the negative-and-intrusive sorts in both worlds. His portrayal of boarding house life in New York is classic. It is matched by his ability to show the appeal of Eilis' home town. Ultimately Eilis must decide where her future lies. 
 Saoirse Ronan as Eilis - she dazzles in the role 
 Eilis Lacey is a fully realized character you will be able to relate to, someone you will remember. Her concerns may have been set in a particular time and place (or places as the case may be) but the issues she faces are no less true for people of many eras from all over the world who take on the huge challenge of immigration. This is not an action-oriented page turner, no shoot-outs or car chases, literal or figurative. Instead it is a beautifully written, patiently paced tale that is well worth the reading.

Though I'd guessed the killer early on, and the mystery never had me scared, I wanted to keep reading because I wanted to understand the why of it and see how it all played out. I liked the characters, the setting, the atmosphere of there being a murderer on the loose only a week or so before Halloween. I liked that there were no stupid horror movie tropes (i.e. the MC running TOWARD the clear danger and not away, at least without trying to be cautious and smart about it first), and that there was also a focus on the normal, on the regular every-day teenage stuff. As with Stephanie's contemporaries, this was sex positive and featured a sweet romance. It also had a LOVELY relationship between Makani and her grandmother, the person who believes in her and reminds her that your mistakes do not define you as a person. I liked that this was all mixed in with the bloodbath because it showed that life continues on despite tragedies. On a whole, I really enjoyed the story!

1011,19398490,5,"""Fantastic! I've been on a historical fiction kick lately and am finding so many great reads. This book focuses on two different young people in France and Germany during World War II. We follow Marie-Laure through her journey in France from the occupation of the Germans, the bombings, and liberation. Werner's story begins in Germany. He is a young boy with an insatiable curiosity, which ultimately lands him in the German army. Ultimately, Marie-Laure's and Werner's paths intertwine, which created more of an attachment to Werner for me. 
 One aspect of this novel that I loved was how Doerr alternated the timelines between the present and past until they converged. The story begins with the invasion of Normandy as the present and circles back and forth until the whole story unfolds. The various characters were rich, realistic, and even the minor ones served a purpose in the main story line or main character development. 
 After fully telling the World War II tale for our characters, the book skips ahead to different points in the future to illustrate how the aftermath has affected each one. I always enjoy this type of closure and detail to a book. 
 The writing was enjoyable and well done. It had a nice flow and did not bore me. The story, while angering at times (as war is), was still heartwarming and uplifting. Great read, and I definitely recommend it. I might have to read some of Doerr's other books.""",2014-07-19 14:35:08,All the Light We Cannot See,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;young-adult,Anthony Doerr

1014,186074,5,"""If you had asked me a week or so ago who I wished I could write like, I would have said Steven Moffat or Kim Harrison, or any myriad of other related writers. I probably wouldn't have had a definitive reason (although I could make a strong case for Moffat). 
 Patrick Rothfuss is a genius. 
 The dust-jacket description of this book really doesn't do it justice, but I understand why it is so sparse. Much more would have risked detracting from any particular reader's experience--and this is truly a book for creating unique and memorable experiences. I am 100% confident that this a book everyone will walk away from with a different takeaway, which I personally think is a wonderful thing in a book. It means I will look forward to reading it again, and I'm confident that at some point I will. Probably prior to the release of book #3. 
 This book was just plain good. It was well written, the characters all shone, and it was an interesting and unique concept. The world worked, and I have no holes to poke at. There were some obvious themes and some more subtle themes--something I don't normally care overmuch about but something that I truly appreciate when it's there. 
 I loved this book so much, in fact, that it's going to be difficult to write this post without getting into spoilers. To aid in that, you're going to at least let me level-set you with some background not provided in the dust jacket description. If you've read the book, you won't get the specific examples that I have sticky-marked (yes, I was so into this book that I put sticky notes on pages with something particularly exceptional--what's so strange about that?). But if you haven't read this book (and you absolutely 100% should--I mean this as emphatically as I meant it with The Fault in Our Stars), you will have just enough information to be able to guess at where I'm coming from. 
 This book is written as a story within a story. A famous author, The ""Chronicler,"" is taking down the history of Kvothe's life over the course of three days. This book is ""Day 1'' of the story-telling, and Kvothe (""pronounced nearly the same as 'Quothe'"") takes us through the early stages of his life in some 600+ pages. We learn about some of his younger decisions that have influenced his motivations in later situations, hereto unknown. Interjected in this story-telling is the present-day, and we get glimpses of what has happened post- the story we're hearing now. And, as we learn towards the very beginning and ends of the book, the present isn't exactly dull either. 
 I'm going to start my assessment with this: It is extremely difficult to write a good book with a story-teller format. I've tried several times, because I do find something extremely elegant in the format. It is incredibly difficult to juggle the present with the past, to be able to make you feel informed in the present-day without giving too much information about what we haven't learned yet. Rothfuss has a spectacular knack for this format, and he is a master tease--he gives little bits of information and lets you stew over them before finally resolving (or not) the tension. So good, in fact, that this deserves a whole paragraph when we get there. Suffice to say for now that I am simply impressed in the elegance with which this story has been presented, and I am envious of the skill it took to do so. I may make another attempt at this format in the very near future. 
 Now, if you're a regular reader here, you know I spend an awful lot of time talking about characters and emotions. There is a part of me that doesn't want to spend much time talking about characters here because they weren't the major selling point of the book. That's not to say that they weren't great--everything that I've said about books with good characters in the past 100% applies here. I loved Kvothe, and I loved all of the supporting characters. What I mean, rather, is that this book stands on its own for so many other reasons it would be an insult to focus only on the characters. So we'll get my rave about Kvothe out of the way early on. 
 I loved him. He has such a singular personality, and while I'm not sure that we would be best friends if I ever were to meet him (we probably would, but I'm afraid he would make me feel stupid, which is not something I'm used to), he sang off of the page, quite literally. 
 I saw some reviews prior to writing this that expressed how much of an ass he was and how they couldn't understand how anyone could like him. To that, I have one thing to say: the fact that you thought he was an ass means that he was written well. This is an example of what I meant when I said that I think every individual will have a starkly different experience with this book. Kvothe had so much depth that every person who reads about him will almost certainly have a different reaction, connect with him on a different level. I cannot express enough how three-dimensional he is. The supporting characters aren't too shabby either, and every single character, even those who only have minor roles, reveals a different truth about the world if you're open to seeing it. 
 He also has a certain wit about him that just pulled me in and wouldn't let go. He is an ass, but he's a funny ass. He's brilliant, and sometimes brilliant people are just a little bit difficult to relate to. When Chronicler is trying to convince Kvothe to let him record his story (I promise this is not a spoiler--nothing on page 50 can possibly qualify as that), Chronicler argues that he has a ""nearly perfect"" memory and that nothing Kvothe says would be mis-represented when the story is finally recorded. Kvothe says that nearly perfect isn't good enough, and when Chronicler says he can write fast enough to keep up with anything he says, Kvothe tests him by spouting random words quite rapidly. Among them are expressions including ""I, Chronicler do hereby avow that I can neither read nor write,"" words in foreign languages, and even made up words. When all is said and done, Chronicler can do nothing but ask ""What does eggoliant mean?"" Truthfully, I'd been wondering that myself. Kvothe's response? ""Hmmm? Oh, nothing. I made it up. I wanted to see if an unfamiliar word would slow you down."" He then demands to be taught the entirety of the shorthand Chronicler used to record so quickly, and in a matter of fifteen minutes he can write it fluently himself. This is a tame example--most of the particularly funny ones require too much background to share in a single post, or would get into the realm of true spoilers. 
 I was just beginning to get invested when I reached the end of Chapter 10--that's when the real world finally slipped away for me. Kvothe started taking lessons from an arcanist, and most of the lessons involved strengthening the power of his mind to hold multiple beliefs at once. One exercise he did was called ""Seek the Stone,"" where one side of your mind hides a stone in an imaginary room, and then the other side tries to find it. Kvothe shares with us that one time he looked for the stone for almost an hour before he asked the other side of his mind where it was, only to find out that he hadn't hidden it at all and had just been waiting to see how long it would take for him to give up. He follows this up with the comment: ""It's no wonder that many arcanists you meet are a little eccentric, if not downright cracked."" I swear, and you may think me strange for this, I laughed for a solid ten minutes before finally turning back to the book and continuing on. This page, by the way, is when I decided I wanted to put sticky notes on my favorite parts. 
 I'm spending so much time on this topic for a reason. The wit in this book, and more importantly in the characters, is incredibly important. This book has a lot of darkness in it. It is not for the weak of heart. Kvothe had a rough childhood, and his turmoil will become your own if you invest the time in these pages. The wit and sarcasm alike serve as a much needed comedic relief. It was not unheard of for me to range from crying to laughing to both within a single page. I honestly don't think I could have made it through Chapters Eighteen through Thirty if I didn't have enough positive emotion to keep me going. As it was, I'm glad I got through all of that in one sitting or I might have been hesitant to even pick this book back up. 
 That said, I think it's time to talk about emotional investment. I've tip-toed around this subject in the past, partially because I haven't been able to pinpoint anything in particular about the writing that elicits such emotion from a reader. I think in this book I was, at least a little bit. I mentioned earlier that Rothfuss is a giant, ingenious tease. He toys with our emotions throughout this entire book. There were moments where (in hindsight) I felt like I was a contestant on one of those shows where you get voted off, and where the judges make it seem like you're the one who's going to lose this week, and then they tell you you're safe. Of course, I didn't think that at the time--at the time all I could think about was my utter relief that the bad thing didn't always happen (oh, how I wish I could give a spoiler right now). 
 Part of the reason Rothfuss is able to play with us thusly is his skill with suspense and tension. Personally, I think it's very difficult to build suspense when there isn't something inherently suspenseful going on. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the times when I felt most strongly about it, there truly was something inherently suspenseful about the story. But there were other times where that wasn't necessarily the case, and I was just as on-edge. He does this through word choice and timing. You remember one of your high school English classes, where they have a discussion about word choice and how you can change the mood of your story by choosing certain words? I have never seen such a good representation of that as I have in this book (with the exception, perhaps, of Poe). But more importantly, Rothfuss just doesn't let you get settled and comfortable. Every time the narrative begins to get comforting, he says something that warns you that the comfort is going to break. Again, no examples because of, well, spoilers. 
 And part of the reason that this works so well is because of the format of the story. Kvothe is telling us about his own life, not Rothfuss telling us about some random person. This is a real person we are getting invested in, and it's his autobiography. And even more importantly, we have enough hints about the present/future to leave us wondering how we get there. In some ways, it makes it all the more believable, even though we have some interjection conversation that casts doubt on the events. 
 That said, one of the things that I love so much about this book is its strong roots in story-telling. When I studied abroad in Denmark a couple of years ago, I took a class on European Storytelling (which was not nearly as much of a blow-off class as it sounds). In it, we studied some of the traditions of story-telling: numbers, themes, imagery, etc. There are these cues in spoken stories that have to be there to trigger our memories of what happened earlier, or to warn us that something is important and we should pay attention now. 
 Rothfuss/Kvothe got all of this right on the nail. From the significance of numbers (seven is a big one in this book) to the spectacular imagery (I'm pretty certain I could actually hear the music whenever Kvothe was playing his lute). Parallels were drawn between stories told to Kvothe when he was very young and what was going on in his narrative flawlessly. The numbers and lines from stories he had told countless times became significant in his love life (including the old wive's tale about there being seven words that can make a woman love you). 
 Most importantly, there wasn't a single wasted word. Hard to believe in a book of this size, I know, but every single detail mattered. Even ones that seemed like they could be written off as little more than mere world-building turned out to be highly significant. This book expected a lot of its readers, and it gave a lot in return. That said, I could go on for hours, but I don't think I should. 
 Please go and read this book for yourself if you haven't already. It is my new favorite ever. As you might have guessed, Patrick Rothfuss is my new role model when it comes to writing. And now I'm left with two questions: 
 When do I get to actually read book 2 when I have two books that I have to read by the end of the month? 
 Why in the world did it take me so long to get around to reading this book? Seriously, Dad told me I should read it four or five years ago ...

 Wow...I'm not going to lie, this book really surprised me. It was so good and so different than anything I've read recently that it was absolutely what I needed. The writing was good. The characters were better. I'm expecting at least 4 books in this series but I can see where a book 5 could work as well. And I will read every one of them...the characters are just that good. 
 I loved Sydney - she was funny and sweet and over the top adorable. I love that with Brian's she rediscovered who she was and the person she lost while giving up everything to her husband. The more we learn about him the more we realize how bad they were together and what a jerk he was to her. She flourished with Brian and became the girl she was before losing her. 
 Brian was broken - but damn he was perfect when he was with Sydney. Their banter was endearing. Everything he did for her and gave her was just...perfect (I can't think of another word). With Sydney's help, he slowly recovers from his tragedy and becomes the man he was before that happened. Together they found themselves. 
 We're not done with them either. They still have something big to take care of which I'm guessing will get in book 2. Which should be really, really good because the tension between characters built during this entire book and man I can't wait to see more of Jamie!

1027,23995290,5,"""I received an ARC of this book at Phoenix Comicon 2015- not in exchange for a review. 
 What can I say besides-- I love this book. Love love love. Jason Hough once again brings a fantastic combination of character and world building to his readers. 
 It is hard to say too much about this book without spoiling it, which makes it one of my favorite kinds of books. The mystery of what is happening, and following Caswell through his adventure, is half the fun! As such, I'm going to be as vague as possible while still trying to help you decide if this book is for you. 
 One of the many things that Hough does right in this book, and in all of his books, is that he gives agency and competence to even his ""secondary"" characters. There are female characters just as badass as their male counterparts, but not in the cliche form of a tomboy, ""hard as nails chick"". They are female, and they are still competent. 
 The other thing that I enjoyed thoroughly about this book was the world building. There were no terrible, drawn out expositions introducing me to the world. The way that it was written made it easy to follow, and I had all the information I needed when I needed it. I especially enjoyed the introduction, and they way that we are introduced to Caswell's line of work. 
 I was hanging on every word of Zero World from beginning to end, to the point where I had to remind myself it's rude to read when you're out to dinner with friends. The plot doesn't slow down, even with the intimidating large size of the book (which is not as big as it seems because you get a bonus freaking novella at the back of it! SCORE!) it went quickly for me, and I am a sloooow reader. 
 It is a through and through Sci-fi Action Adventure. If you are looking for something other than that, then this might not be the book for you. But if you want action, intensity, space, and intrigue, then pick up Zero World, it's the book for you.""",2015-01-29 09:41:18,Zero World,fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;fantasy;paranormal,Jason M.

1028,14358,2,"""Sometimes you hear about a book that sounds really dumb and you just have to read it. I remember liking A Wrinkle in Time when I was a kid and found out about this lame-sounding dolphin book and brought it home from the library on impulse. 
 I probably would have looooved this book when I was about 11. The reasons for this are twofold. First of all, it's packed to the brim with adolescent wish fulfillment that would thrill a tween or young teenager, but bores the life out of an older person. The main character, 15-year old Vicky, is a plain-Jane dreamer/poet who's not gorgeous or smart like her younger sister, but three good-looking boys have suddenly decided she's hot stuff and are competing for her attention. There's Leo, the devoted platonic friend that Vicky feels an emotional connection to but isn't attracted to. There's Zachary, the sexy troubled bad boy with more money than God, who takes her to country club dinners, rides in his Alfa Romeo, and plans on getting a private plane. Finally, there's Adam, her older brother's hunky friend with sea-colored eyes, who works with dolphins at the marine research lab. Ooh la la! Also, by hanging out with Adam she gets to ride dolphins. Yep. She gets to ride around on a dolphin's back, and it leaps out of the water and she flies through the air on the back of a gleaming dolphin. Isn't that another thing 11-year old girls get off to? I'm pretty sure that's the sort of thing I was drawing pictures of on my Trapper Keeper at that age. She also finds she can communicate with dolphins psychically for some unexplained reason. Yeah, whatever. 
 The second reason I would have liked this more as a child than an adult is that the religious overtones of the book would have gone right over my head at that age. When I was a kid, I loved the Narnia books. I had no idea that sneaky C.S. Lewis was trying to make me believe in Jesus. Talking animals, man! Flying around on the back of a magical talking lion! I was all about it. I know that Madeline L'Engle was Christian but I was barely aware of Christianity in 5th grade. But now: oh man. Vicky spends the book trying to come to terms with the inevitability of death and suffering in the world. Her minister grandfather, who has leukemia and does not have long to live, is Vicky's bargain-basement source of and biblical wisdom and general cheap platitudes. Whenever she's confused about something, she goes to grandpa, who reaches into the depths of his wisdom and soothes her with some passage from the good book. The first part of the book especially is full of heavy-handed Christian moralizing. I will give L'Engle credit for making her book not as awful as books that are intended as Christian fiction, where all conflict is resolved when the characters realize all they needed to do is put their lives in God's hand. There are even some sympathetic characters that don't identify as religious or believe in heaven. But overall, all the Christian stuff was hard for me as an adult to stomach. 
 I would give this 2.5 stars if Goodreads would let me. The stuff about death was actually pretty interesting. But all the boy-juggling and dolphin ESP communication? Not my cup of tea, and that was 3/4 of the book.""",2011-07-07 13:06:37,"A Ring of Endless Light (Austin Family, #4)",young-adult;fiction;fantasy;paranormal;children;romance,Madeleine L'Engle

An odd interruption to the flow of the story within a story, and then the story is just... hung...

She is comfortable with her lifestyle in Ireland but is pushed and prodded by family and friends to travel to America, specifically to Brooklyn, in the 1950s. Where she lives, where she works and who she associates with are all carefully managed for her. Even who she sees romantically is not an active decision. It is more of a going along with what has happened and not making a rash and abrupt change. The one event that does cause an immediate abrupt change in her life and takes her back to Ireland leaves her with a dilemma. Will she stay in a life that is familiar and comfortable or will her previous ""rash"" decision take her back to America to a life that seems to be already set for her?

1033,8683812,4,"""The reread of this over two years after the initial read for my local book club brought additional observations. You could so easily see the inevitability of their separation and divorce as the Hemingways who so obviously loved each other grew in different directions, He tries to embrace the lifestyle of the rich and famous of the 1920s and she remains much more traditional and not a very ""modern""girl. At times I wanted to scream at her to ""grow a spine"", but really I loved that she more or less remained true to who she was at the core of herself. What an impossible situation their life became! It seems that such success would bring self-confidence, but for him, at least initially amd then with a long succession of wives and lovers, it seems that the fame and fortune continued an ever present need for continual ego-stroking. He did not really care for truth from his closest critics if it did not praise his work, his course of action, even his innermost thoughts. McLain really makes this read as a memoir from Hadley rather than fiction featuring real historical figures. 
 Written as a memoir of Hadley Hemingway about her marriage to Ernest which lasted five years, this novel gives us a glimpse into their relationship and into the ""modern"" lifestyles of the American expatriates living in Paris during the 1920s. The literary and art worlds are explored as those names that we all know interact with the Hemingways. 
 Having read several of these books mentioned here made me even more interested in the day to day lives and activities of the authors, especially that of Hemingway. It also made me want to read his A Moveable Feast which is supposed to be his definitive work about his first marriage. I guess the literary and art world even today exposes a different way of living and that those within that culture today are even freer and continue to push the boundaries of acceptable behavior as they definitely did in the 20s.""",2011-09-13 19:28:43,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

1038,147842,4,"""The latest installment of Kristen Britain's Green Rider series is markedly different than others. In the previous entries of the series, heroine Karrigan G'ladheon is what appears to be an ordinary girl who is continually thrust into danger and who manages to scrape by and save the kingdom. She appears to do this almost by sheer willpower or luck. However in The High King's Tomb, Karrigan is forced to confront the reality that she isn't any ordinary Rider and to recognize her own growing powers. Unfortunately for her, this personal journey is yet another fraught with danger--complete with sinister new foes, impossible love, and interference of the Gods. 
 Hilariously, the very first thing Karrigan struggles with in The High King's Tomb is her inability to stave off a dashing thief known as the Raven Mask while in a corset and high heels. Humiliated by both his resulting flirtation and escape, Karrigan is further shamed when revered Arms Master Drent consequently dismisses her as his swordsmanship student. Refusing to accept his dismissal, Karrigan enlists the help--and clothing--of a friend and storms down to spar with him in full ladylike attire. It is in moments like these when Karrigan shines the most. She is at her most interesting and capable not when she is fighting evil, but when she is dealing with every day circumstances. 
 Like most people around Karrigan, Arms Master Drent is stunned by her daring and agrees to not only accept Karrigan back as his student, but also to train her to fight when dressed like a lady. Equipped not only with her saber in hand, but also with throwing knives strapped to her leg, sharpened hair pins, and a loosened corset, Karrigan throws herself into the new training. Unbeknownst to her, these new skills will be put to the test very soon. But her new training isn't the only area where Karrigan finds herself off balance. Stifled by her helpless feelings for King Zachary and his impending marriage to Lady Estora, Karrigan is more than happy to set off on a newly assigned mission. Even though she is hampered with a hapless new recruit, Fergal--whom she suspects is more trouble than he is worth--Karrigan is relieved to distance herself from King Zachary and the love that she knows cannot and more importantly--shouldn't be. Karrigan's strong moral compass and her resulting refusal to have an affair with her King manage to be both refreshing and extremely disappointing. 
 I love that Karrigan isn't like many other female characters that pine away for or go back and forth about her love interest. But author Britain has consistently done such a good job at slowly building rapport, mutual respect, and attraction between the two characters that I couldn't help but crave more. To my dismay, though Karrigan and King Zachary think about each other often, their interactions are kept to a bare minimum. Luckily, Karrigan and Fergal's mission is threefold. Tracking down a lost and ancient arcane book, acquiring more of the preternaturally special horses to outfit the Riders, and looking into the disappearance of a fellow rider serving as a spy in the notorious Mirwell is certainly plenty to keep both Karrigan and the readers busy. Plus, seeing the headstrong Karrigan facing the challenge of mentoring a new rider is enjoyable. And the book is peppered with extremely enjoyable appearances by old faces, both friendly and antagonistic. I loved reading about Estral and the Bayberry sisters again. 
 But these moments of peace in ""The High King's Tomb"" are few and far apart. A new foe emerges in the form of the sinister and magically gifted Grandmother, who threatens not only the King that Karrigan loves, but all that she holds dear. To face this dark new evil and its goal of reawakening Mornhavon the Black, Karrigan is forced to confront the fact that she is not like other people--even other magically gifted riders. And when a god gallops into her life in the form of a black stallion, Karrigan has no choice but to saddle up and to realize that maybe greatness wasn't thrust upon her, but something she was born with.""",2014-07-21 07:43:58,"The High King's Tomb (Green Rider, #3)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Kristen Britain

 When we first meet main character Karrigan G'ladheon, she has just been kicked out of school for winning a fight against a spoiled noble classmate. Unable to face her father, she runs away with only the clothes on her back and a few precious items. But when a king's messenger bursts onto the scene, she learns that getting kicked out of school is the very least of her problems. With two black arrows in his back, the dying messenger implores her to take up his mantle as a Green Rider and deliver the message to the king. Despite his chilling warning to ""beware the shadow man,"" Karrigan reluctantly swears an oath to deliver the message and sets off on his horse, which seems to know more about the mission than she does. Hunted by humans and the reemergence of an old evil, Karrigan learns that the world itself and everything she holds dear is dependent on the delivery of this mysterious letter. 
 I could not put this book down. Like Karrigan, I was on a mission--the only difference was that my race against time was to finish this book. To me, author Kristen Britain created a fantasy world as rich as Lord of the Rings with a more relatable Katniss Everdeen at its helm. Not bogged down by a frustrating love triangle a la The Hunger Games, the reader was able to watch Karrigan navigate impossible odds and come into her own. I could easily picture myself in her shoes and I can't wait to see how much more she grows in the future installments.""",2014-05-13 20:07:42,"Green Rider (Green Rider, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;fiction;romance;history;historical fiction;biography,Kristen Britain

 This story ran a lot longer than it needed to IMO. And seriously, what the fuck is up with author's lately and their obsession with their characters having ""Pet Names"" for each other? It's like Baby, Babe, or Darling won't do...alone. (Not that those aren't overused, too sometimes) 
 They have to couple it with shit like ""Nightie Girl"", or ""Chex Mix chick"" Or, in this story, ""Trouble"" & ""Wild"" oh and of course ""my Girl"" and ""my boy"". I was ready to start a drinking game every time they used the nickname but then I remembered the way my Monday's are set up...I'd be too trashed to go out in broad daylight. That, and alcohol poisoning is likely a ""No, Bueno"" situation on any day of the week. 
 Also, maybe I'm the weirdest female of my gender but I rolled my eyes at the hysterics in the final arc when the big reveal happened. And at the unrealistic way ""Her Boy"" resolved it. I seriously considered downgrading from 4 stars to 3 because the whole time I was reading her reacting all I could think was, ""Is this Bitch serious?. 
 But the book was VERY entertaining and cute up until the last few chapters and the ENDING was satisfying. So yeah....I think downgrading it would make me even more almost as dramatic as Sidney at the end of the book. 
 And we can't have that. 
 So.... 4 Stars

 There's something about reading an Elemental Assassin book that's like curling up with your favorite blanket. It's familiar, in the best sense of the word. 
 It's kind of funny that I say that about a series of books where the main character kills people on a regular basis. But it's true. We know there will be blood, that there will be bad guys, and that Gin will do everything in her power to kill said bad guys. She'll likely use her Stone and/or Ice magic along the way, and Finn will likely get his suit dirty. There will be snark, and smexytimes with Owen, and if Estep could please stop describing the food I'd be forever grateful, because I can't make it through a damn book without getting hungry. 
 One of my fellow reviewers at Vampire Book Club commented that the story felt tired - that Gin felt tired. And I'd agree. It's not that the pace drags or anything. Even though the book follows the pattern set out in the previous Elemental Assassin books, the dialog and the characters still keep it interesting. But Gin definitely feels tired. She's lived a hard life since her teens, and the last year of it has likely been the toughest yet. 
 Without giving too much away, I'm SO glad the final fight happened. It was a long time coming, and not just because of the inevitable demise of the villain (that's not a spoiler, right? I mean, you know that's going to happen. It's GIN. C'mon.) It'll be interesting to see how Ashland takes it in the books to come. 
 As much as I love this series, though, I think it's time for it to start winding down. And I was disappointed at how obvious MM Monroe's identity was. Oh well. Still a thoroughly enjoyable outing with my favorite assassin.

I have a tiny confession: I skipped Darkness in the series (I can't even remember now why...) so I read it after Numbers.Oh what I wasted! This book was amazing, infuriating, sexy and funny all in one. I'm so glad I read it at least now (better later than never, right?). 
 ---------------------x-------------------- 
 FULL REVIEW FROM BLOG: 
 First of all, I have to admit this is one of the series (and authors) I have a soft spot for and no matter what, I love everything she writes. Another confession: I never gave less than 4 stars to a New Species book. I think this says it all. By the way, this is the 12th book of the series, and can be read as a standalone, but for the full experience, I advice you read the first 11 first. Don't worry, you will love all of them and it'll be worth it! 
 On the other hand, I can tell what I hated in the books along with what I loved. And the worst thing with this book was Darkness' asshole behaviour. I hated Kat's boss too, he was a real dickhead and deserved what he got. I don't particularly like Bluebird either. I don't know why, I just can't get on well with her. 
 But let's get back to Darkness. The way he kept Kat arm's length all the time filled me with so much sadness. Even though Kat came there undercover, she wasn't - isn't a bad woman. She never lied to him with bad intends, only to defend herself and her job. She loves the New Species, and is fond of Darkness, so she would never hurt him. Which we can't say about Darkness. I know he had a rough past and is damaged inside... But the way he treated Kat even after she put herself on the line for him, made him a grade A asshole in my eyes. I admire Kat for sticking up so long to him, I'd have kneed him in the balls already a couple of times of not murder him in his sleep. 
 The sex scenes were hot and smutty, but at first I felt all the distance Darkness wanted to put between them and it made the love making less enjoyable. But I have to say that the first kiss scene and the last sex scenes were filled with warmth and it made my little smutty heart so happy. They deserve each other and happines even though Darkness remains an asshole for behaving like that with Kat. I truly understand what he went through and why he wanted Kat away from him, but would it killed him to be a bit kinder to Kat? He could smell when she was hurt, so why do it anyway? It made me so sad for Kat. 
 So why did I gave 5 stars when Darkness was such a dick? I have a soft spot for damaged and hard-ass males too, so I kind of loved Darkness with all his flaws. This was one of my favourites of the series. 
 I loved how every other character was represented (or at least most of them) or mentioned and loved seeing Fury, Justice and the others with their mates and kids. Also, I can't wait for Flame's book!""",2015-11-02 10:20:23,"Darkness (New Species, #12)",fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Laurann Dohner
1047,186074,5,"""I almost didn't read this book, but I'm glad I did. 
 I was looking for some good fantasy and chanced upon this book via Goodreads. As per my want, I looked at the reviews to see if this would be a good read or not. I saw several reviews that something to the tune of ""Kvothe is overpowered and too amazing to be an interesting protagonist"". I don't particularly like stories where things are too easy for the protagonist and nothing interesting happens. I therefore decided to pass over this book. It was only through a good stroke of fortune that a friend of mine read this and told me that though Kvothe is strong, he has to deal with some bad shit and this story is interesting. My curiosity piqued again, I gave this a go. I'm glad I did. Thanks Anup. 
 Rothfuss's style of writing is different, mixing the 3rd person present with the 1st person past. He tells you things are going to be bad before they are. He lets you know the overall end result of a thing miles before we even get to it. There are so many things here that could easily make a story bad. And yet, this story is good, oh so good. Three chapters in and my curiosity was piqued. A couple chapters more and I was hooked.

1048,186074,5,"""The Name of the Wind, By Patrick Rothfuss 
 First read April 2015. Reread November 2015. 
 This is my second time reading this book, the first book in The Kingkiller Chronicles trilogy. My first read of the two books (third is not yet published) was only a few months ago. Despite the short timeframe, I found myself thinking about this book so often that I felt the need to read it again. I've read 11 books since, including the Game of Thrones series, A Song of Ice and Fire, and there is no comparing any one of them to The Name of the Wind. 
 Patrick Rothfuss is truly a poet. No book I've encountered has been capable of supporting such a vast fantasy world while maintaining such beautiful structure. When imagining the world of Temerant, the world of The Kingkiller Chronicles, Rothfuss included an enormity of details. These details are uniquely satisfied with only briefly touching the plot, leaving very few lengthy and direct descriptions of places or cultures. Instead, the complexity of the world is slowly revealed in a way that can only be compared to light finding its way through a heavily wooded terrain. 
 Information about the world is never forced upon the reader. Instead, Rothfuss trusts the reader to gain an understanding of the world throughout the story, relying on short and subtle contextual descriptions. In this way, he keeps you emerged in the story as you unknowingly learn about the cultural, economic, and political platform upon which the story rests. 
 In the beginning, the wonders of this novel are merely glimpsed. This peaceful beginning makes the incidents to come all the more meaningful. You will feel a deep understanding and strong connection to Kvothe, our one-of-a-kind protagonist. 
 Kvothe's interactions and blunt thoughts let loose a wonderfully believable story. His words dance across the page, and in times of despair, his words seem to carefully slow down, heavy with the weight of delivering bad news. 
 The Name of the Wind is a retelling of Kvothe's much rumored, but little truly known, life. Although he is still young, the legends of his youth have gained him the notoriety of a God. When a scribe goes searching for the man behind the legend and finds him living an all too ordinary life as an inn keeper, he is able to convince Kvothe - who has taken on the name Kote - to tell the story behind the tales. It is in this retelling that we learn of his years singing with happiness, running from unbearable tragedy, and of the tangled roots that mark the truth within the legends of Kvothe.""",2013-01-15 12:13:32,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

1051,186074,5,"""I came upon this book because of a chain of curious events, and I'm so glad it did. 
 Name of the Wind is a great fantasy book, and one that I can recommend eyes closed. The main character (Kvothe) is interesting, both inspiring the Gandalf-like awe of the superpower chadacter, but also evoking a lot of his humanity, his vulenarabilites, weakness and strenghts. Since the book is narrated as a memoir, it's nice to have him reflect on past events with the privilege of experience and wisdom. 
 The other characters are also rather intriguing, Denna in particular has shine both as non-standard character in fantasy, and a rather unique female character. Other characters are less colorful, but they fill thei quota rather nicely. 
 World-building is very good - you get a real feel of how things (culture, religion, science) works in this world. I guess the best approximation would be medieval Europe just before the Renaissance - a lot of science and industry pushing their way from religion and superstition. 
 Perhaps one of the more interesting aspects of this book have to do with ""magic"" - there are fantasy books on which magic is just.... well... magic: say the words, move the wand and stuff happens. Other books try to take away the ""magic"" from the magic and explain it as some type of physical phenomena. On name of the wind you get both of them: sympathy which from common people is ""magic"" but is really a natural occurrence, and then you have the Names which is akin to magic. The interplay between them in the world works really well for this book. 
 In terms of narrative and pacing the book is quite nice. Maybe the first few episodes that jump between the inn and the Chronicler seem a bit disconnected, but that gets sorted out real soon. An interesting piece of this book and narrative style is that you are given hints of important events on Kvothe life, so you expect them and anticipate them, so you are left wondering if ""this is it when..."" It works rather well. [spoiler] For example you know he gets expelled from the University. Every mischief that he made had me thinking if that is when he got expelled...[/spoiler] 
 It also seems an story within a story - the larger story which seems to include the memoir doesn't get as much development, just a hint here and there; let's hope it gets mroe spotlight for the next book.""",2014-02-11 06:23:04,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

And it is; a bunch of really fun characters, fast-moving plot, humorous twists in the story line, all help to make this an enjoyable read.

But, I really didn't like the main character much or his strange life.

1055,5099602,4,"""let me start with saying it was good book. a very good book. fast paced, the characters were great, i loved Po, and Kasta, and the chemistry between them. 
 Kasta was cold, realistic, kind, practical and although being strong for a while she was under the control of her uncle, doing things she didn't want to do because he told her to, being his pawn. in a way she feared her ability (and i liked the suprise Cashore had for us about it). 
 i loved the plot, and the way Kasta was able to go against the antagonist and end everthing. 
 what bothers me is the way Kasta didn't want kids and how she viewed her own gender, almost loathing women and how she was at first a bit scared that her relationship with Po would weaken her. 
 i'm sorry, but in order to be a strong female you don't have to deny your female side, wear pants and act all manly. loathing your own gender doesn't make you strong. there are diffrent types of strong. loving girly things, being gentle, feminine, liking jewlery doesn't make you weak. 
 a strong woman, in my opinion, need to accept all that she is, be true to herself and go after her passions, making no apologies for who she is. 
 another thing is Kasta's view of marriage as somtheing that tames you, making you belonged to a man, his property. marriage is partership, it's not supose to limit you and take your freedom, not in the way Kasta views it.

It's been a long time since I've read a fantasy novel that I thought was this original and well-written. Probably not since 2004, when I first picked up A Song of Ice and Fire, have I cared so much about a made-up world or its characters. Well... really just Kvothe. A silver-tongued bard who actually cares about his music, and spends a good portion of his page time convincing you about why, just has such a higher cool factor than your typical saves-the-world, overly emotional, dipshit Chosen One With A Really Sharp Sword. I used to think writing about music or the feeling of playing it was impossible and a task doomed to failure, but Rothfuss has persuaded me otherwise. This is not just a really, really good fantasy book - a remarkable feat in itself, since the genre is so full of abhorrent, utter shit - but a good novel, period.

1058,186074,5,"""This was a really enjoyable read, I'm completely enthralled by Kvothe's story. 
 The narration especially was really interesting and well done. It can be easy for first person narration to get annoying or feel limiting, but by giving us the dual perspective of both ""story Kvothe"", and ""storyteller Kvothe,"" Rothfuss has more room to play, and he can tease us by having Kvothe spoiling something that happens later without any context, leaving the reader wanting to know more about what exactly happened, and how Kvothe got to that point in his life. 
 Also, since Kvothe is telling his own story, you get to know him not only through the biographical tale he is relating to the Chronicler, but also through the WAY in which he tells it. For example the first thing you learn from Kvothe's style of speaking is that he's is a big fan of words and showing off his own intelligence, which makes some of the dialogue even more beautiful and funny to me, because you have to wonder if the way he's describing it is EXACTLY how it went down, or if he took any small liberties. The contrast with the brief intriguing insights from the Wayside Inn's other patrons (especially Bast, of course), is also really cool because after being stuck in Kvothe's head and perspective for so long, an outside perspective adds a new layer of depth. Your friends will always know some things about you that you won't or refuse to pick up on, after all.

Finally after I started reading, I did not put it down for a single second until I finished, took a deep breath, and sat back in silence as I absorbed everything I just read. A Love Letter to Whiskey had me on the edge of my seat, gripping my Kindle with a racing heart and sweaty palms as I prayed for a happy ever ever. 
 Whiskey, or Jamie, and B's story was one of the highest highs and the lowest lows. It was about two people so right for each other and yet never right enough. Following them through their high school years, college and into adulthood, these two best friends turned something way more complicated than lovers were the epitome of loving someone more than yourself. Their tale weaved in and out of each of their respective relationships all the while theirs was stronger than any bond they could ever create with someone else. But timing and life seemed to always be in the way of their true love story leaving both reeling and yet constantly unable to let go. This book may have been one of the most complex and tragic romances I've ever read but with the way Ms. Steiner created such a clever backdrop for their story, I was always full of hope. 
 As their story continued, I honestly started to wonder how in the world I could ever be content with their ending. And yet as the story wrapped up, I found myself at peace and absolutely satisfied with the way their story was written and how it played out. I honestly only wish for a bit more closure at the end. I wanted to be wrapped up one more time in them instead of only getting a peek into B's Love Letter to Whiskey.

 Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See is an incredible novel. It's immensely popular, with upwards of 60,000 ratings on Goodreads, and it won the Goodreads choice for best historical fiction in 2014. Upon finishing, it's no wonder the novel has received such praise and attention. 
 Marie-Laure LeBlanc is just six years old when she loses her sight. Her father, a locksmith at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, handcrafts a model of their entire neighborhood, with every detail included, down to the shutters on the houses and the manholes in the street. Marie-Laure learns the model, memorizes every aspect so that she is able to traverse the neighborhood on her own. The German aggression at the start of what would become World War II is a distant thing to Marie-Laure. The Parisians hear horror stories of the German advance. Surely they cannot invade France? We must be safe here in Paris. When the Germans come knocking (read: battering), Marie-Laure and her father flee from Paris to the small walled city of Saint-Malo, Brittany and the household of Etienne LeBlanc, Marie-Laure's great uncle. Little do they know, there's no escaping the war in France. 
 Werner Pfennig is a young German orphan who lives in an orphanage with his sister, Jutta. When Werner finds a discarded, smashed radio, he tinkers with it until its static, slowly reforming into voices, announces its revival. It's not long before Werner's brilliant mind is discovered by German authorities, and he's given a place in a harsh military school before joining the Wehrmacht itself, roving the countryside in search of Resistance fighters. 
 All the Light We Cannot See is many things. A tale of two youths coming of age in a time where their countries were being sundered by war, and from the blurb, the paths of Marie-Laure and Werner are destined to cross. It's an exploration of human nature, both good and evil. It's a tale of magic, friendship, love and loss. Doerr writes with staggeringly beautiful prose and, harmonizing with short, precise chapters, the tale within All the Light We Cannot See moves with verve and passion, evoking a swathe of emotions with the turn of every page. 
 ""Storms rinse the sky, the beaches, the streets, and a red sun dips into the sea, setting all the west-facing granite of Saint-Malo on fire, and three limousines with wrapped mufflers glide down the rue de la Crosse like wraiths..."" 
 Every word has its place, and the struggles of Marie-Laure and Werner, of Jutta and Etienne, even of Reinhard von Rumpel become ours. The war's grim reality is recreated in this prose that borders on haunting. The characters have layer after layer of depth. You can't help but smile along with Marie-Laure when her feet touch the sand for the first time, when she hears the waves of the English Channel crash against the shore of Saint-Malo, or share her fear when she cannot see the cause of it. You can't help but share Werner's utter fascination and enchantment with all things scientific, all things related to the radio, or his anguish and sadness when he and his squad track down Resistance fighters who are summarily executed. 
 All the Light We Cannot See is a deeply, deeply moving novel that encompasses so much of what I love to see when I read. It has a beautifully detailed setting and an exceptional cast. It evokes emotion and has prose unparalleled in anything I've ever read. It's a stunning package culminating a decade of Doerr's work, and his dedication shows.

1076,186074,5,"""There are just some books that you have no conception of how much you will come to love, until you read the book, and fall in love. That's what happened to me with this book. At 722 pages, I think this is the longest book I've ever read and finished, all the way through. When I read it, the world fell away. The mark of a good book. 
 I worry about my reviews being too repetitive, and I don't want to mess this one up. So I'll keep it simple. 
 I would ask this book to marry me, if it was legal to marry a book. If I had to choose a book to take to a desert island, this book would be on my final consideration list. Yes, I am known for my bizarre excitement when it comes to books. They mean so much to me. I may seem like I hype books unnecessarily. It's not the case. But, if a book finds a place on the shelf in my heart, then I do want to rave about it. Such is the case with The Name of the Wind. 
 If you aren't sure about diving into a 722 page book, take a chance. My game plan was to read it over the month. Hah! I read it in about a week. I was that sucked in. Not sure that your interest will be sustained for over 700 pages? I don't think you'll be disappointed, if you enjoy books with fascinating characters. And Kvothe is definitely fascinating. 
 This book made me cry, it made me laugh, it made me angry. I got excited, I got frustrated. I was sad when it ended. Yes, even after 722 pages, I wanted more. 
 I walked the long road that Kvothe walked. I couldn't abandon him. When the book would go from his story narrative and back to the inn where he was telling his story to the Chronicler, I was like, ""Wait. I want to hear more."" That's the kind of story that Kvothe has. I don't want to suffer the things he did. But, I like the idea of having an epic story of my life to tell someone. That probably won't happen in real life, but there's an identification factor here in this: We were all young, and rich with dreams; we have all cried bitter tears as some of those dreams died painful deaths. Only for new dreams and possiblities to be born. That is what this book shows. 
 I may add more to this review, because I think I could say more. Right now, I think this will do. I hope you decide to read The Name of the Wind someday.""",2009-01-23 15:11:27,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
1077,19057,5,"""This review is also on my website c: 
 I had read this book years ago but wasn't able to remember much of it - perhaps because I was too young to connect with/understand the narrator. I adore Markus Zusak's voice so I gave it another read through and I've never adored a book on the second read through as much as I did this time. I remembered, a few chapters in, the main plot points but it only served to make the story sweeter for me. 
 The character and his problems were real and close to heart - and though we were often only given glimpses into the lives of characters around him, Zusak developed them enough to make us care about these distinct characters. The stories were all distinct and yet equally alive for me. They weren't just names on a page - they were people that had lives - beautiful or ugly, fulfilling or not. And I loved that there were so many. I felt that, like Ed, I had been given an opportunity to let these stories - these lives - impact mine. 
 Zusak made me care about the lives that Ed touched in the course of the narrative and, in turn, Ed's own situation. The soft spot in my heart for Australian narrators (especially those that happen to be 19 year old males - however oddly specific) only served to make me love Ed more. His voice was real and familiar to me. The language and structure - the comments on their own lines that were often self deprecating never failed to make me smile. The ""Aussie feel"" of the narrative was another familiar thing that made it even more enjoyable for me. 
 The message here was that anyone - however ordinary - can make a difference. Little acts like  new Christmas lights for a family that cannot afford to replace them  went a long way to help those he reached out to. 
 Often I find the narrator reaching out to the reader annoying - it usually pushes me out of the story, reminding me that I am not in this story but merely observing from behind the pages. But Ed made me feel more included - pulling me into moments that I couldn't imagine as clearly  like trying to decide if he should kill a man - not something I'm familiar with!!  
 The ending had completely escaped my mind - and this, I'm sure, was another case of reading and not understanding - but it did not disappoint in the slightest. It was an unexpected twist in a second read through that left me smiling. The message was beautiful with a moral presented in the same way the stories of the other characters in the book were presented - given to us with no expectations and no pressure. 
 All in all - a brilliant read that made me smile. Highly recommend to all that have not read it (and even to those that have read it once or twice before!!)""",2013-06-12 00:31:38,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak

1083,13449677,5,"""We decide our paths- one way or another. 
 Meet Dante Walker: 
 He's a bad boy. He's hot. He's funny. And dammit if I don't wish he wasn't mine. 
 Meet Charlie Cooper: 
 She's a good girl. She's a little nerdy and not very popular, but she's sweet, caring, loving, a great friend, and nice to everyone. 
 When Dante died he was given two choices. A)He could stay in hell and rot or B)He could slap on the little gold cuff and become a Collector. Easy choice right? So, for the last 2 years he's been collecting souls for the Devil, and he's the best man for the job. 
 ""I am The Collector. It's not as bad as it sounds. I'm kinda like Santa Claus. We're both jolly guys with a passion for frosted cookies, the color red...and sorting souls."" 
 All his hard work is finally paying off. He's up for a promotion. All he has to do is bring in this one soul and then he's free to walk the earth, never having to worry about returning to hell again. 
 ""You don't know who you're fucking with, princess. Ain't no one do bad like I do."" 
 So who's the lucky soul he's come to collect? That'd be Charlie Cooper's. At first, he thinks this is going to be another routine assignment, but when he flips on Charlie's soul light and realizes this girl is next in line to Mother Teresa, he has to wonder what his boss wants with her soul anyways. Either way, he's doing whatever the hell it takes to drag her ass down with him. 
 ""More doing, less thinking--that should be my mantra."" 
 10 days. That's all he has. He has to turn good girl Charlie into a sinner just like himself or he's going to kiss that promotion goodbye. His only rule was, Never let things get personal. But with a girl like Charlie, that may be harder than he thought. Which turns the ""easiest job"" of his career into an adventure all it's own. 
 ""What do you think you're doing, Captain Psycho?"" he says, breathing hard. ""You almost shot my ass."" 
 But when unexplainable events, random people, secrets and lies come into play- anything goes. Turns out this one little assignment may be more important than boss man let on. 
 ""'I'm on it,' I told Boss Man when he handed me the envelope. 'Like white on rice.' I didn't say the last part. He wouldn't appreciate the humor."" 
 Dante's either going to finish the job or deal with the consequences, but who say's they can't have a little fun along the way? 
 ""I swear, I take you girls to have a little fun--"" Read: get into trouble. ""--and all you do is drink your body weight in liquor and hang out with jerks."" 
 Annabelle covers her mouth and giggles like a lunatic.

1088,186074,5,"""Patrick Rothfuss writes beautifully, his prose being so poetic at times that you get completely swept away by it and can even make you look past some of his mistakes when it comes to plot. Before I even begin my review of the book I'm going to put it out there that if you come to this book expecting a great quest filled with bad-assery and action packed revenge, you will be disappointed. While these may be some of the underlying reasons for Kvothe to begin his journey to learning at the University, this is not the focus of the series. Instead, these books are telling the story of a man--err, boy--and how he became a legend. It is recounting the things Kvothe has done and the places he has gone that have come to define him and made him into a household name. 
 The Name of the Wind was definitely my favorite of the two books. As it seems necessary in the stories of heroes, Kvothe first endures the tragedy of his parents and traveling troupe being murdered by the mystical Chandrian. This drives the young boy to go to the University to learn more about this group of men from the faerie tales he heard as a child. Although the story does start out rather slow, once he reaches the University and begins learning more about magic you instantly get reeled into this world, feeling as though you are discovering it right with Kvothe. He makes friends, gets banned from the archives, makes enemies, and excels in most of his studies. There are some side adventures as well, such as trips to Imre with his friends to play his lute, fights with an unbearable school mate, Ambrose, or killing a dragon with the elusive and mysterious Denna. However, the first novel is primarily focused on his successes, and fumbles, at the University, and Rothfuss is able to make the magical studies of a teenage boy absolutely engrossing.""",2015-05-20 13:13:36,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 The book took a little while to grow on me, not without it's fault, it was still a good read. 
 I could've done without the addition of 'One', the female 'baddie' and some of the description; clothes, hotel room, the word jizz :P I could've done without too. 
 Our heroine, Paisley was the perfect depiction of an average girl with quick wit, she became more and more in my eyes as the book went on. I liked her development. She made me laugh a whole bunch. 
 Our hero, Six, could have done without the sociopath tag to be honest. I didn't see him as one, he felt more meat-heady and I liked him like that. He was hot, dangerous and rough. 
 The story was slow in the first half, building up to an action packed second half, I liked the secondary characters (loved Five) and the way it amped up. 
 The sex was most certainly one of the highlights. Rough, dubious non-consent, voyeurism and pure lust burned throughout the scenes. 
 I wouldn't say it was a dark read, I wasn't totally grossed out or afraid for our heroine, but it certainly was a thrill. Recommend for lovers of Shay Savage, ironically.

1093,17325147,5,"""Two Star-Crossed lovers who don't believe in fate... 
 OhgodOhgodOhgod... Soooo sad, sooo heartbreaking... but sometimes hot? And sometimes fun? Totally lethal combinations for me. 
 Little bit of blurb... Loner Blythe is still grieving, four years after her parents death and her brothers failed future, she feels she only has herself to blame, she can't let go, she feels numb, she can't breathe... A chance meeting with Chris and his amazing siblings cures her of her loneliness, gives her a sense of belonging. Blythe feels a connection to Chris, and he helps her heal, but their bond goes deeper. Chris is strong and assured, but is more broken than you can imagine. 
 ""So I have spent four years without touch and affection and without wanting any. 
 But now there is Christopher Shepherd, the boy who changed all the rules."" 
 Blythe... She is a complicated character, well, they all are, but Blythe contradicts herself often: She can be totally weak, but mostly strong and brave, sometimes dependant on Chris and other times not. She the most hilarious drunk ever. She's romantic and kind, and totally confused. Sometimes she's convinced she's lost her faith, but she doesn't want to have lost it, and more often than not, the world will prove her wrong. 
 ""You saved me. Do you know that? You saved me. And I wish that you would let me save you."" 
 Chris... He's drowning in his own pain, he needs rescuing, but just doesn't allow Blythe in. Hot, strong, confident, royally messed up. This boy... god, he was so emotionally confused and extremely head-strong. I loved him and other times I fucking hated him! I wanted to tell Blythe to abandon him and screw someone else! He was good for Blythe and bad for her at other times. 
 ""I'm very aware of how well I am operating in situations that I would have been incapable of broaching even last summer. Chris, Sabin, Eric, and Estelle, have rescued me, and I can't fathom how I can ever begin to repay them."" 
 Chris' siblings... totally loved them! You know a book is good when the secondary characters are worthwhile; not only do they add to the story, but they are sooooo loveable. We get the outlandish fun-loving Sabian, the repenting foul-mouthed Estelle, and the gay and cool Eric. 
 ""He leans into me and kisses me again. Harder this time. He tastes like eternity, and healing, and completion. No one else could ever kiss me like this, of that I am positive. I could breathe in him forever. I could fall in love forever."" 
 The sex scenes... Realistic, hot, emotional at times, the characters have a connection on a spiritual and not just a physical level. The scenes are totally functional, they serve a purpose and add to the story, not just there for the sake of it. 
 ""I guess I liked the idea that... well, that there might be some kind of larger meaning to life or whatever. My mother was into that. She had a non-religious spiritual side to her, if that makes any sense. She believed in the idea of fate and destiny. An interconnectedness and purpose in life."" 
 Fate... EEEK, can't say too much about it, too much give-away, most was obvious, but it intended to be. There's a couple of flashbacks - not too many - that give us more insight in how the characters are drawn together. 
 Left Drowning was one of those books that is quick to get into and hard to let go. It's so easy to get absorbed in the emotions of this book, I really recommend you savour it, really make time for it, get yourself invested, it can build you up, and when you almost think you have a handle on it, it can bring you crashing down. It will make you feel their pain and heartache. 
 It's all about grieving, belonging, coping, faith, family, love, moving on and forgiving. It made me tear apart, get hot, and laugh out loud.""",2013-04-04 08:20:55,"Left Drowning (Left Drowning, #1)",romance;young-adult;fiction,Jessica Park
1094,22820059,5,"""Scorching--a deliciously hot page turner full of intrigue and angst. 
 I'm such a big fan of R.K. Lilley's novels. They are the perfect blend of steam and story, and lately, just the right amount of suspense to keep me addicted. The Other Man is the story of Lourdes and Heath, whom we met in The Wild Side series. From the beginning, there was an instinctive allure to Lourdes... the older woman who had crushed on Dair, and who felt so put together and elegant. And then there's Heath. He exudes mystery, hides secrets. He's surly and dangerous. Brutish. And sexy as hell. From the moment the two collide, sparks fly, flesh craves. For a women like Lourdes, who had never felt that kind of fire, meeting a man like Heath only promised the kind of burns she may never recover from. 
 ""I'd come to the attention of a man who didn't play by normal rules, and my life was about to get very interesting."" 
 There was something about Heath that Lourdes couldn't stay away from. She knew she was playing with flames, but her body desired to risk it all for one night of unrestraint. 
 ""He was a wild thing that was not even close to being tamed."" 
 Their time together was hot as hell. But just as quickly as he had entered her life, he was gone. Vanished. It was clear that Heath hid everything--from his feelings to his job to something more not yet discernible. He was vague and secretive and absolutely dangerous. 
 ""His eyes would never be the window to this soul. It was hidden somewhere else."" 
 But as Lourdes struggles with understanding him, with the expectations around everything to do with him, with her own desires and happiness, he continues to come back, disrupting all her best-laid plans. The more time they spend together, the more he softens. What was supposed to be a one-night stand is now suddenly more, but so far short from a relationship. Was Lourdes affecting him in a way that would nurture the possibility of a future? 
 ""He was rough around the edges... He was uncivilized. Churlish. Uncouth. And strangely, kind of sweet."" 
 The story unravels through Lourdes' perspective, but we get the sense that Lourdes does reach Heath in a way that's real. But at the same time, the more turns the story travels, everything we've experienced gets questioned. 
 ""I don't have a future, Lourdes. But if I did... If I did, it would be yours."" 
 This all happens on a timeline parallel to The Wild Side series, so it was really cool to experience this other side, knowing some of what was happening. In addition, there are some scenes that had me smiling big, especially if you're a fan of the Tristan and Danika series, and the Up In The Air series. The first half of the book really sets up just how unbridled their desire is. How they can't stay away from each other, while the second part, anchors us emotionally with some addictive angst and heartbreak. I just loved everything about it, loved the brooding, reluctant hero. Loved to see a tortured soul find peace unexpectedly. Loyal readers of R.K. Lilley's books will LOVE this as much as I did, and new readers can enjoy this as a sizzling standalone novel.""",2015-05-21 20:35:03,The Other Man,romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,R.K. Lilley

 ""Your parents died. Your world fell apart."" 
 I nod. He puts his hand on my cheek. 
 ""You were left drowning."" 
 I nod again. 
 ""And you're struggling to breathe."" 
 What a moving and heartfelt book... layered with a multitude of emotion. It built slowly, gripping you, taking you through this well-written story of love and forgiveness. Blythe has been so lost. She's been drowning in pain with a tragic past that won't let her go. She's been a shell of a person. Not feeling. Not living. Not loving. 
 ""It's natural to want to connect with other people, I guess. Except I don't want to. Not really. Which must be why I don't have any real friends. But I drink and play the role, holding hope that self-fulfilling prophecies exist, and that I might make a connection and feel whole again if I pretend long enough."" 
 Blythe has been like this for so long, she's even blocked some of the memories in order to survive. She's lost everyone she loves, she's so far under that she can't seem to pull herself above water. 
 ""I have mastered the art of melancholy."" 
 That is, until she meets Christopher Shepherd. He helps her breathe and find life again. He makes her feel safe and loved. He's everything she's needed for the last four years. I absolutely loved Chris from the beginning. His calm and introspective demeanor helped Blythe to feel whole again. They have this immediate connection that somehow feels right. 
 ""I have never felt as close to anyone as I do to Chris. It is not from the amount of time we have spent together, but from the strength of the unquestionable bond we share."" 
 The more she gets to know Chris, however, the more she realizes that he is also harboring pain from his past. He won't open up about it, but somehow, he carries the pain with him, so deeply buried. 
 I loved watching them fall in love. Despite their immediate connection, it happens slowly, with time and through each moment they share. They were so absolutely perfect for each other, so connected, so right... I totally felt it. 
 ""He leans into me and kisses me again. Harder this time. He tastes like eternity, and healing, and completion. 
 No one else could ever kiss me like this, of that I am positive. 
 I could breathe in him forever. 
 I could fall in love forever."" 
 When we finally learn more about what happened to Blythe, my heart completely broke and hurt for her. The way it all unfolds, the pain was palpable and I held my breath as I read through those scenes. Christopher again was there for her 100%. He just knew exactly what to do for Blythe. 
 ""Being with you let me feel, feel everything, and I needed that. I remembered better with you, I healed better with you, and you made... you made everything real."" 
 We also learn eventually about what happened to Chris and again, I was left breathless. Jessica Park really did an amazing job at making us feel these scenes mind, body and soul. It hurt big time. I was absolutely shattered and outraged over what happened. 
 And then, as if we hadn't experienced enough heartache, Jessica Park throws in a twist that absolutely and totally killed me. I couldn't believe it. I was so hurt. I was mad. I felt completely betrayed right along with Blythe. But mostly, I was really mad. It was a total shock that the story took this turn and I just couldn't believe that it was happening after everything that had transpired. 
 ""You are the great love of my life that I'm never going to have."" 
 I was literally glued to the page, until the very end. Thankfully, it did have a happy ending (huge sigh of relief). This book was just a really powerful, well-structured story which left me reeling in terms of how entwined everything was and how it all fell together. It was almost as if it were destined to be. In addition to Blythe and Christopher's story, I also loved how Blythe became part of the Shepherd family. A tight-knit group of siblings that embrace her and love her. And although each one of them is also flawed and struggling in their own ways, they were all there for each other until the very end. I absolutely loved that. 
 This was a really wonderful book that exceeded my expectations and I definitely recommend it! A powerful, emotional, moving and honest story.

1096,15847757,5,"""Epic, explosive and exciting. A worthy finale to a sweeping, one-of-a-kind series. 
 How do you read the end of a series you've loved so much? So many expectations. So many feels. So many hopes and fears for the characters that have become perhaps, embarrassingly real? Starting Iniquity, the final book in the Premonition series, was as thrilling as it was bittersweet. I wasn't ready to let go, but at the same time, I was ready to see it all come to what I knew would be an epic climax. I'm sure the question on everyone's mind is this: Does the book deliver? 
 Yes, it does. In spades. 
 There is so much action, so many unforeseen twists, so many emotions that surged to the surface as Evie experiences more hardships, more losses and more heartache. Amy Bartol is able to capture that larger-than-life feeling she bottled beautifully in the other novels, but with an intensified urgency as the story naturally culminates in a bloody battle between Sheol and Heaven, between Evie and an enemy who is chillingly ruthless. Past and present collide, choice and fate duel, as Evie must make difficult choices that will affect her, and others, for the whole of eternity. 
 Much is explained, including Xavier's, Reed's and Brennus' affinity with Evie. We better understand that invisible thread that has bound Reed and Evie in this lifetime, connected them when situations have been dire, given them strength when hope waned. 
 ""Hold onto the string, love. Until the current shifts and we can be together again."" 
 The above quote is one of my favorite in the series, and we really understand the depth and the reason for that tether between them. Throughout the series, Evie and Reed have been separated time and again, but despite what happened, and despite the feelings Evie felt for anyone else, it's this unique connection, this love, that has given them both hope for happiness. 
 ""I'm clutching the invisible thread that binds me to her. I won't let go, not for anything in this world."" 
 Brennus is also back in all his charming, arrogant glory, trying to banjax Evie's future with Reed. His devotion to her is boundless and eternal, and he certainly proves that to Evie, and even to her friends. We also see just how much Evie has managed to humanize Brennus, softening his heart despite him remaining unyielding and fierce towards any adversary. And her heart, no doubt, also recognizes Brennus in a way that is singular and very much real. 
 ""I'm the light to his darkness. There's no escape; he's a part of me."" 
 I don't want to divulge even the highest level of the plot line, but clearly we will learn some truths that shed light about everything that happens--past, present and future. Is there a happily ever after? Yes. The very end opens some interesting, unexpected possibilities worthy of discussion, but despite that, the novel delivers in every way that counts, with moments of passion and love, action and surprise, and of course, unbreakable friendships. The story moved me to tears more than once, and revel in believing that eternity is lived out in wild, unrestrained happiness between characters that will forever remain marked on my heart.

1107,13872,3,"""Well, you pretty much know from the start that the future of the Binewski family would go down in flames, I just didn't think that meant literally! The ending was not surprising and I don't think it was meant to be, but finding out what happens to them along the way and the specifics of their eventual demise made this book a real page turner. 
 They were, for the most part, likable/real characters. And from the whole notion of their conception (basically the opposite of eugenics) through their rise and fall, they are pretty unique characters. Oly also makes a good narrator, being the most passive Binewski. Although, a few chapters from Chick, the twins, or Arty's perspective would have been interesting. 
 I enjoyed Dunn's detailed descriptions. It made reading about them almost tactile and reminded me a bit of Nick Cave's writing. I also kind of enjoyed the chapters with Miss Lick and how that all went down, but would have preferred that more as a long epilogue, rather than chapters stuck in throughout the book. It made the ending seem only about Oly and Miranda, when the vast majority of the book was really about their whole family. 
 The thing I disliked the most was the final chapter with Chick. Without giving too much away, it felt poorly described (which was disappointing, given Dunn's other amazing descriptions) and anti-climactic. 
 Overall though I liked it. Definitely a book for adults. Especially those fascinated with the whole freak show sub-culture.""",2012-06-25 08:31:15,Geek Love,fiction;fantasy;paranormal,Katherine Dunn

The multi-talented child pursues knowledge, especially knowledge of ""sympathy"", a type of medieval, pseudo-scientific magic. Along the way, Kvoth experiences loss, desires for revenge, the beginnings of love, and both fortune and misfortune. The story's scale isn't epic, but does allude to larger forces in the wider world, and foreshadows Kvoth's future involvement in them. 
 The story is entertaining, but the pace is too slow for my taste. I would have liked more to happen in this book, rather than simply being hinted at. The characters are well-developed and memorable. Because it's about students learning magic (among other subjects), parts of it reminded me slightly of Harry Potter, but the story is very different. 
 A quote from the book: ""That's why stories appeal to us. They give us the clarity and simplicity our real lives lack.""

1111,33572350,3,"""I was interested in this book because the publisher's description mentions the Northern California coast setting. In fact, the descriptions of nature are plentiful, however, I frequently found them to be overwritten. Then there is the issue of all forms of abuse of the main character, Turtle, by her father, Martin, in their isolated home, and an overall violent atmosphere. I do not consider myself to be an overly sensitive reader - I have read and enjoyed many novels with difficult themes like this one. However, the graphic abuse scenes seemed gratuitous due to the character of Martin's lack of background, development, and/or context. 
 This book took me a long time to read, which I believe is due to what I perceive to be the overworked writing style. I read the first half and put it down to read other books. When I finally picked it back up, I did find the second half to be more engaging than the first half, probably because of the trajectory of Turtle's character. 
 Each scene in this book is vivid and therefore memorable, although many are hard to read due to content. Some scenes were a pleasure to read, such as the scenes with Turtle and her grandfather, the initial meeting between Turtle and two older boys, Jacob and Brett, and the island scene with Jacob. I also liked how the relationships between Turtle and her teacher Anna, and Turtle and Cayenne, another one of Martin's victims, developed.

1114,10063343,4,"""Sylvia Day writes fantastic and sexy paranormal adventure. This is Book 1 of what will be a 3 book (and 3 novellas) series. The characters are made up of angels, lupines, vampires and one (sort of) mortal heroine. The sex is steamy and explicit. There was a bit too much talking going on during sex, but that was only a minor annoyance. It starts out following the classic ""reincarnation"" trope, not one of my favorite plot devices, but there's a nice twist there if you stick with it. While this is a paranormal romance, there's plenty of action and adventure going on, so the novel isn't overwhelmed by the emotional and sexual elements. I prefer a well balanced book, and this one was perfectly balanced to my taste. 
 The characters were engaging. We're introduced to the hero and the heroine of book 2 in this book. They don't dominate the book, but we get enough of their personality and motivations to be intrigued. There's an ongoing story line that will be continued in Book 2. This story completes the ""love story"" it was meant to tell, but there are several loose ends that we can only assume will be wrapped up eventually as the series progresses. 
 I really liked this book, therefore, 4 stars. If the author had been a bit tighter with her world building and the characters would have done more moaning and less talking during sex, it might have made 5 stars. Still, a surprisingly good PNR.""",2013-01-28 02:45:05,"A Touch of Crimson (Renegade Angels, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Sylvia Day

1117,17980013,5,"""I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Fighting Destiny. I admit the first few chapters in I was a little afraid it was going to be a Fever knock off; but it proved to be an original and entertaining story. Taunting Destiny picks up immediately where Fighting Destiny left off and is a solid second installment. TD has it all: an interesting story, likeable characters, action, humor, romance and some pretty hot sex. The story has lots of twists and turns and sometimes in fact seems a tad convoluted - but that's likely just me having a hard time keeping track of all these weird Fae names and who's related/connected to who. 
 I enjoyed the love/hate tension between Ryder and Syn. Ryder is the perfect crude, possessive, controlling, alpha hero in the bedroom - where it is generally best to be confined. Outside of the bedroom he does recognize that Syn is capable and competent and autonomous. He doesn't like that he can't wrap her up in bubble wrap and order her about, but he still acquiesces - when she decides to leave Faery after her transition, when he needs to ask for her help to recover the missing relics and when he accepts that she needs to go after the assassin that killed her parents. When it counts, Ryder recognizes Syn as an equal. For her part, Syn is still a pretty tough chick; a bit impulsive but passionate and courageous and never one to shrink from a fight if she believes she's in the right. 
 The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger; OK actually it's a huge cliffhanger - but that's OK because I have Escaping Destiny loaded up next on my kindle and ready to go!""",2014-03-29 09:37:12,"Taunting Destiny (The Fae Chronicles, #2)",fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Amelia Hutchins

1120,19398490,5,"""The opening of this book in St Malo in 1944 at the start of a major raid by Allied forces is very powerful. The writing from the start has an intimacy and conveys a real sense of the oppressive feel of the raid. I found myself hooked by this tale very quickly indeed. The majority of the story concerns Marie-Laure, a blind French girl, and Werner, an orphaned German boy from their early years. The eras in the book do go back and forth however the changes are well signposted and generally quite some time is spent in each era of the story. The tale contained here is gently but persistently woven gradually revealing more and more about both the characters and the times they live in both prior to and during the war. 
 I found myself completely engaged with both of the main characters in this book. Marie-Laure's story of blindness, her father's devotion to her and their escape to St Malo from an occupied Paris was so compelling I really did find it hard to put down at times. Their stay in St Malo again was powerfully drawn in the well crafted words. Werner's tale of being in a children's home with his sister and his growing up was wonderfully portrayed too. However the more minor characters were also well drawn and fleshed out too and integral to the overall tale. 
 In the latter stages the story becomes ""edge of the seat"" stuff and very hard to put down. The inherent bleakness of war is almost tangible at times the writing was of such a high standard. In a sense this is a book about ""quests"" as all the main characters are seeking something. In general I've not read many ""prize winning"" books considering that the hype often seemed greater than the story - that is not the case for this book. A powerful and extremely well written tale.

Her parents decide to ship her off to live with her grandma and enter a small town life where no knows who she is and what her secret is. However, small town life goes from normal to alarming when a terrifying killer appears without a clear pattern. 
 I really enjoyed the rotating perspectives with Makani being the central voice that we see. I love several of the characters, especially Makani's grandma. I would love to hang out with her grandma and put together puzzles and stuff. I loved Makini's friends and the high school gossip element as well. It reminded me of being back in school and the gossip that spread fast. 
 However, there were a few things that kept taking me out of the story. The first thing is Makani's big secret past. I wish we knew what it was a lot sooner than when she finally spilled the beans so that we knew what was weighing her down so much. I was finding myself more interested in what the big secret was than the murder plot. Finally, the romance plot overshadows the horror plot. I wish the creepy factor was a little more amped up and that the romance was scaled back a bit. 
 Several of my friends have been raving about this book, so I really wanted to love it. Sadly, it just isn't a match made in heaven. For me, this novel is far more YA romance than horror, which is not something that I was expecting. There are things that I like about this book, but the things that bothered me just made it fall flat. All in all, it's not a bad book. There are definitely some good things going on in it. I think it simply comes down to it just not being my cup of tea. That said, several of my friends love it and I already plan on recommending it to a few more because I know they'll love it too. I also think that it would make a great slasher movie that I would most likely enjoy.""",2017-09-17 14:35:44,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins

 When Sydney Paige's husband decides he's done with their marriage, she finds herself running to her best friend, Tori. Without a job and trying to come to terms with her impending divorce, Sydney is understandably upset. She finds a common bond with her friend since Tori just found her boyfriend of 6 months was not what he seemed. Pissed and out for revenge, Sydney calls Tori's ex and rips him a new one, with all of the vengeance and anger she has. Except, the wrong man receives the call. 
 Brian Savage is drowning in guilt. Living with one purpose, he is focused on trying to help those he feels he's wronged. But when he receives the brunt of Sydney's anger, he feels alive for the first time in a long time and knows that one phone call isn't enough. 
 Best two and a half weeks of my life came from a girl who was never meant to give me anything. and she has given me everything. 
 I loved the side story with the secondary characters, Tori and Jamie. Their banter was fabulous! Jamie is the perfect example of a male whore waiting to be redeemed and he wants Tori to be his redeemer. Tori is spectacular. She's level headed and not afraid to speak her mind. She is fun, mouthy, sarcastic and protective. The perfect friend! 
 I know you were just joking about us ditching our men and starting a lesbian life together, but as long as we keep it purely platonic, I could swing it. 
 One thing I noted while reading, I got a bit of a Kristen Ashley feel with the male characters. They are pure alpha goodness. The heroines are strong, thank God. Nothing worse than a weak heroine coupled with an alpha male!

 ""The son pays for the father's sins"" 
 I love stories about Italians, and the Mafia and I love a great forbidden love story. And as always, JM Darhower delivers brilliantly! Two kids caught in the war of their families who want nothing more than to be together. She, the only daughter of one of the most powerful mafia families in NY, and he, the first born ""heir"" to the other most powerful mafia family. 
 One tragic day many years prior, caused the one-time family friends to turn on each other. The Galante and Barsanti children were raised to always be on guard and never trust the other family. Each was out to bring the other down, sparing no one in the process. 
 This caused her Father and brother to become over protective of Genevieve ""Genna"" Galante, which forced her into rebellion. She was a wild, carefree risk taker. Getting arrested wasn't a big deal - there would always be family to help her out. Her brother, and best friend Dante, vowed to do anything to keep her safe. 
 Matteo ""Matty"" Barsanti had never felt important to his father even though, by birth rite, he stood next in line as the boss. He was kept away from his family for many years. He felt like he was a ghost. Someone that no one noticed. When his mother fell ill, he came back home. He certainly didn't come back to his place in the family as the next to take over the Barsanti crime family. 
 It was one fateful day in a broken elevator that Matty and Genna meet. The connection between the two was undeniable. They had no idea they were enemies. Each family hating the other. They should hate each other, simply because of their last names, that's what they've been taught. But they couldn't. 
 ""Because you know who I am."" 
 ""And I'm telling you I don't care."" 
 ""But it changes things,"" 
 ""It does,"" ""We have to be much more careful now."" 
 And they try to be careful, but fate has a way of catching up with you. When their families find out, the powder keg of revenge blows. The question remains, will these two ever have a life together? 
 The romance and suspense in this book kept me glued to my Kindle. Reading this in one sitting, my only regret is that I do not have the next book in my hands! I want need it NOW! With fantastic writing, characters and plot, this story has me begging for more!

Eight hundred years earlier, Alais is entrusted by her father to safeguard a ring and book, the latter containing the secrets of the true Grail, the former a way to identify a guardian of it. 
 Armies are at the Cite walls, and it will take great strength to keep the artifacts and secret of the labyrinth safe. 
 This was generally okay. Mosse's writing is of the quality that it hooks you into the story after a few chapters, taking you to a cliffhanger of sorts before switching to 800 years in the past, or future. It's these cliffhangers that keep you around to unravel the mystery of the labyrinth and what links all these people previously unknown to one another. 
 It felt well researched and legitimate, and the historical element to the story was by far the best, but at times it felt every page of the 694 that made up the story. It just felt a little too long when the going got tough, and the ending was okay. Again, the 2005 setting was just a little below par - absolutely no complaints to be had on how the Alais' story was tied up. 
 It's a real slow burn to get into (I said the same about A Song Of Ice And Fire, and look what happened there). So, with this being her debut and my first foray into Mosse's work, I'd say it's a fair shout I'll read more, and keep my fingers crossed that historical elements are a strong theme in future books.""",2014-09-20 11:38:51,"Labyrinth (Languedoc, #1)",fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime;romance,Kate Mosse

 In the world of the Seven Kingdoms, a few people are born with Graces -- talents beyond the ordinary. At age 8, Katsa discovers what hers is: killing. Trained by her uncle, the king, to be his enforcer, Katsa also secretly forms The Council, a group dedicated to helping the helpless. But when she rescues an old man who has been kidnapped by a neighboring king, Katsa meets a man who is nearly her match in fighting, and discovers a mystery that threatens all of the kingdoms. 
 This immensely satisfying fantasy, with echoes of Orson Scott Card's Treason, comes from a first-time author, but you would never know it without reading the flap copy. Kristin Cashore writes like a seasoned veteran and avoids rookie mistakes and pitfalls: her fluid and effortless prose sweeps the reader along from the exceptional opening-hook chapter, with complex, fully-realized characters, an original and well-paced plot, and a thoroughly thought-out world in which it is set. She even manages to make the reader long for the sequel, not by resorting to the usual, tired device of a book-ending cliffhanger, but simply by making you want to spend more time with these compelling characters in this intriguing world. 
 Though the synopsis might make this sound like a Grrl-Power screed, and there are certainly elements of empowerment here, Katsa's Grace is not one of them -- she despises and fights to control it. Boys, at least those open-minded enough to consider a book with a female hero, will enjoy it just as much, if not more than girls. It's packed with gritty action and adventure, though it's unfortunate that the unnecessary sexual content will limit the appeal to pre-teens.

 As I whole, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The first half of the book didn't quite capture my attention and I found myself wanting to read something else/DNF this book altogether. But once things starting becoming more suspenseful and the slasher scenes became more explicit, I found myself flying through it. 
 My main issue with this book was that it almost felt like Stephanie Perkins was writing two different novels within it. We have the murder-y aspect, and then we also have a romance aspect, which didn't quite mesh well together during the first half of the book. There was a lot more in the first half that revolved around the main character Makani's romantic relationship development and I can see how those going into this book expecting a dark suspenseful thriller may be disappointed and confused by the novel's set up. But I do think the novel does really begin to pick up once the second or third murder occurs, and I ended up finishing the last 60% of the book in one sitting. 
 One other thing that bothered me about this book was the fact that there is this big dark secret Makani is keeping regarding how she ended up moving to the Midwest from Hawaii. But I didn't think it was that bad? Once it was revealed I was kind of just like, ""That's it?"". Although that might just be because I'm looking at it from a 24 year old's perspective. I can't speak from a teenager's perspective on this topic and I acknowledge that. I also wish that the characters would just do the responsible thing! Like, why are you wandering off on your own when you know there is a killer on the loose? This is how you get murdered. 
 On a more positive note, I like that Perkins included diverse characters within this novel, and rather than having them be stereotypical caricatures (which is what I was worried about when I first started reading), she really aimed to flesh out their personalities and gave even minor/secondary characters a brief background. I found most characters memorable and distinct, no matter how briefly they appeared. When it was mentioned that the main character is half-Hawaiian, half-black and that one of her new best friends is transgender, I was definitely wary. But I think that Perkins does a decent job writing them as realistic individuals who are just living their every day lives. However, I wish she did less telling and more showing. 
 This definitely is a nod to true crime stories and reminded me of the many true crime/murder podcasts that I listen to. But as this is sort of a unique blend between contemporary romance and suspense/thriller, it is rather niche and I can understand why people have a difficult time knowing how the feel about it. I personally really enjoyed it despite the slow start and I wouldn't mind reading it again! I even enjoyed the romance aspects of it in the end!

1149,175243,5,"""I dream dark dreams."" A suitably fitting opening for the second installment from Charlie Parker's dark and violent life. 
 As the anniversary approaches of his wife and daughter's brutal slaying, Charlie 'Bird' Parker retreats to Maine, where he hopes old memories might begin the healing of his soul. 
 But fate can be a cruel mistress, and Charlie's decision to take on a simplistic case, involving child support and an ex-spouse, leads to his involvement with the untimely and savage murder of another woman, and her child. 
 The wounds from old memories force Charlie headlong into the hunt for another maniac killer, and draw him directly into a nightmare reenactment of earlier horrors suffered. 
 Dark Hollow is a second outing for Charlie Parker, and if anything this book was even more enjoyable than Every Dead Thing - which was a superb read. 
 John Connolly really is at the top of his game, and I love the overlaying 'taint' of supernatural carried by the Parker novels. These higher forces carry no direct impact towards the crime solving, but rather exist as a shade on the periphery of Parker's life.

 Grace Marks was a real person. She was really convicted for murder back in 19th century Canada and there has always been controversy about her trial and imprisonment. Having read a bit of Atwood, I can easily see what appealed to her about Grace's story. The appeal of a woman falsely imprisoned by a male-dominated legislature must have been almost impossible to resist. 
 But although there are touches of the feminist angle, which is to be expected, I was relieved that there wasn't as much of this as there could have been. In fact, throughout, Atwood brings her considerable skills to bear in constructing a character who you feel undecided about from beginning to end. This is the best thing about the novel. The whole point, I guess, is that we are all so quick to judge andng no use facts to our own benefit when doing so. 
 When Dr Simon Jordan is finally confronted with as much of her story as she can remember, he too fails to arrive at the clarity he is sure must be there if he probes deep enough. It's what he does with this that left the ending hanging for me. I left the novel a bit frustrated by the lack of closure. That's kind of unusual for me. In retrospect this is, again, a feature of Atwood's skill in storytelling. It's quite possible you are meant to be left hanging in much the same way that history has been regarding Grace. 
 So, this is an interesting novel that benefits from some excellent character development (Grace and Dr Jordan) and some less captivating (Nancy Montgomery, Dr Jordan's landlady whose name escapes me now) but is not for those who like all their loose ends neatly tied up when they reach the back cover.""",2012-11-24 10:58:36,Alias Grace,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;mystery;thriller;crime,Margaret Atwood;Brigitte Walitzek

1166,15797848,2,"""Have you ever wondered what would happen if YA contemporary romance writer turned to the dark side? Apparently, this is it, and I'm slightly disappointed. 
 This book is a high school murder mystery, kind of like Scream but not as good. Sorry, to admit it so early on, but the mystery in this book never really pulled me. Part of this may have been due to the fact that most of the victims are people we hardly know. 
 If you want the audience to be afraid for the characters, you are gonna have to go a little Game of Thrones and start killing people who have at least more than two lines. Put your characters in danger! Show us that the characters we've grown attached to can die! 
 Since there was none of that going down there was no real suspense. 
 There were certain questions that went throughout the book, that was obviously made to create suspense but ended up failing. Questions such as, ""what is Makani's deep dark secret""? We spend half of the book wondering why she left Hawaii and while it was bad, it's really not as bad as the build-up made it seem. 
 Also, things like the villain reveal. I love that moment when we finally find out who done it. Here, it was really anticlimactic. I had to read it twice to make sure that this random person they so casually mentioned really was the murderer. And then, his motive seemed a bit...lame, I guess? It wasn't predictable but it made me think like it wasn't a good enough reason to start murdering people. Not that there ever is a good reason to murder people! 
 In the end, I think that the overall problem with this ""murder mystery"" was that it read too much like a regular contemporary novel. I liked the romance between Makani and Ollie, it was cute and engaging and it made me smile at several moments. The problem was that while I was reading about them falling for each other, I couldn't help but remember that people were getting killed in the background and little focus is being cast on it until the end. This ain't a romance novel Stephanie! I would a appreciate a little less love and little more murder! 
 Still, I liked this book. The writing wasn't bad. The characters were pretty decent. The horror was very gruesome, not very scary, but bloody and really messed up. Also, I read one of the murder scenes before going to bed one night and was paranoid until the moment I fell asleep, so it gets bonus points for that. 
 Now, here are a few tips for survival. 
 1. This is for the current and future parents out there, if there is a murderer who's killing teenagers on the loose in your town (God forbid), don't go on vacation to Vegas and leave your child alone! What kind of neglectful parent are you! 
 2. Another thing, if there is a killer on the loose and you start noticing sketchy things in your house one night, don't assume it's a prank, and don't go to investigate! Run for your lives! 
 3. Also, if you are in a crowd while a killer is on the loose, don't decide that now is the best time to enter secluded/abandoned area on your own. That just ain't smart. 
 4. Lastly, if a shadowy figure appears in your house, and you are aware that a killer is out there, heck, even if you aren't aware of the killer, don't go slowly walking towards it! Grab a weapon and run! #CommonSense #Survival

 The tone is light and not-quite-realistic, something like The Pirates' Mixed-Up Voyage or The Phantom Tollbooth. I really enjoyed that tone and feeling because it took me back to those books I enjoyed as a kid. It seems like the actual content is a little more mature, though. Lots of characters die, some of them quite tragically and gruesomely. There's explicit child abuse. The narrator has a Lemony Snicket sort of style where not everything he says in his asides can be trusted, but I don't know if the target age range for this book would understand that -- the narrator talks about how apes can go months without drinking water and have a hump to store water in, for instance. An older child would know this is tongue-in-cheek, but a younger child who's used to those kinds of educational asides might just take it at face value. It's a chunky book, though... Maybe it's intended for an older audience, but in that case, it's the tone that's weird, and the foreshadowing is much too clear. 
 I did really like the characters, especially Sir Tode the cat-horse-man knight and Ole Frederick, the enormous dogfish. The characters are all male for much of the book, but Princess Peg enters the narrative seamlessly later on, and gets some POV time. I loved the concept of enchanted lands interacting with other places more technologically advanced, and that concept plays out nicely. 
 I picked this one up because I loved his newer book The Night Gardener. TNG is middle-grade horror while PN&HFE is fantasy. I feel like TNG had more focused themes and was more successful overall, but PN&HFE is still good. Both books are kind of deconstructions of the ""crippled Victorian orphan"" trope, although I can't find anything to tell me if Auxier is doing that on purpose... Either way, I think it's cool. Both books have young boys with disabilities and it's handled well, a matter-of-fact part of the character's identity but not the dominant part. Again I think TNG is slightly more successful... PN&HFE does contain magical healing at the end,  but it is heavily telegraphed as the story develops. 
 3.5 rounded up to 4 for overall mouthfeel, to continue my food-review metaphor. I'm a little confused, but I enjoyed the book.

 Racquel, an outsider from her own kind as well as the human race. Unique in a way that cannot be forgiven by the Shadow races. On a quest to save her sister she starts discovering more about herself, her heritage and that of those around her. You cannot help but care for her. 
 The Good: 
 Well - there was very little that wasn't good. I enjoyed seeing how the other characters started loosening up around Racquel. Especially Ethan. I like reading all the little facts about the Fae, Lycans, Witches etc. Therefor in turn I think it was quite clever how Brandy Nacole made Racquel ignorant about her heritage. 
 The Not so Good: 
 Danika's uptight attitude started grating on my nerves after a while and I wasn't a big fan of Coy (I cannot stop thinking of fish when I read his name). 
 The Great: 
 Jarred on the other hand, I really enjoyed. I know this is more then likely never going to be in the cards (if the blurb on Blood Burdens is anything to go by) but I found myself wishing that Racquel would get with him.

 In Book two of this series, the Chinese have learned that the gift they were sending to Napoleon (an unhatched dragon's egg) was intercepted by the British. Now a delegation arrives demanding the return of the Celestial dragon, which, by tradition, can only belong to a member of the royal family. But Capt Laurence is not about to turn Temeraire over; and the dragon does not want to be parted from his beloved Laurence. So the two travel to the Far East to plead their case. The voyage is long and there are several serious mishaps, but when they finally arrive at the court of the Chinese emperor, they find even more intrigue. 
 I was reluctant to read the first book - [His Majesty's Dragon] - because ""fantasy"" is just not my preferred genre. But a friend whose opinion I trust persuaded me to give it a try, and I loved it. Now, I think I am hooked on the series. 
 Novik does a great job imagining a fantasy scenario where dragons are part of the Air Corps, while also keeping the reader in a (circa) 1801 time frame. The battle scenes are exciting, and the intrigue builds suspense. I really like the growing relationship between Temeraire and Capt Laurence. Temeraire is growing and maturing, and shows great loyalty to Laurence. They are truly a team, listening to one another's point of view and weighing the pros and cons of a situation.

 When Hadley Richardson arrives in Chicago to visit her friend Kate, she has no idea that she is about to meet the man who will change her life. At a party that night she's immediately attracted to a tall, darkly handsome and charismatic young man who is eight years younger than the 28-year-old Hadley, but so much more worldly than she. One dance leads to another, and before long Hadley lets herself be led towards happiness ... at least for a while. The young man is Ernest Hemingway and after a whirlwind courtship they'll marry and move to Paris, where they'll absorb the atmosphere and enjoy the company of the likes of Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, Scott & Zelda Fitzgerald, et al. It is the Jazz Age, and while their money is limited, it's enough for fine dining, more than a little drinking, some gambling and even skiing. Of course, it will all end much too soon, but their story will captivate the reader. 
 For love, as we know, is not enough by itself. The Hemingways have love, but they are not prepared for the whirlwind that is 1920s Paris and find themselves ill equipped to deal with the realities of their life together. Ernest is moody and ill-tempered as he struggles to find his creative voice. Hadley does her best to support and help him but often finds herself feeling lonely and insecure. She suspects he is unfaithful but doesn't really want to know, so she continues carrying on. When the end of their journey together finally comes it is nevertheless tragic for being expected. 
 I have been a fan of Hemingway's writing since I first read 
 The Old Man and the Sea 
 when I was in about 8th grade. There is something about the immediacy of his writing that just draws me into his novels and stories. Most of the book is written from Hadley's point of view, but there are sections where McClain emulates Hemingway's style, giving us a glimpse of his point of view. This is very effective when read on the page, partly because the change in font clearly alerts the reader to the different narrator. But the audio book doesn't have any such clue, and I found it confusing and distracting. Nevertheless, Carrington MacDuffie did a good job of the narration on the audio version. 
 I had previously read Hemingway's memoir, 
 A Moveable Feast

1180,4954833,3,"""This slim novel is set in the early 1950s. Eilis is just finishing her studies, living at home in a small town in Ireland with her widowed mother and older sister, Rose. Her three brothers have all gone to England for work. Rose encourages Eilis to get more training in bookkeeping, so she might have a good office job one day, and Eilis goes along with this plan. When an opportunity presents itself for Eilis to go to America for a better job, Rose encourages her to do so. The parish priest sees to it that she has a safe rooming house in which to live, a good job, and even gets her into Brooklyn College to continue her studies in bookkeeping. She's a lonely girl, however. Never really confiding in anyone about her thoughts or feelings, she even denies most of her thoughts and feelings to herself. She meets a young man who slowly begins to enter her life and heart, but just as they are beginning to consider a future together, tragedy strikes Eilis's family back in Ireland and she must go home for a visit. Or is she going back to Ireland to stay? 
 There isn't a terribly complicated plot here, and the writing is fairly simple and straightforward. But there is plenty of tension in Eilis's inner turmoil. She's never sure how she feels, or what she should do, and, as a result, she's easily swayed by the arguments or cajoling of her coworkers, roommates, friends, or family. She does not want to disappoint anyone, and so she inevitably disappoints nearly everyone - especially herself. 
 The novel explores what it means to emigrate - the pain of leaving home behind vs the excitement of a new location; the warm embrace of family vs the loneliness of living on one's own in a strange place. It is also a story about how one young woman sets out to make a life for herself - and wonders if she's made the right choices. 
 I enjoyed this novel and I think it will make for a good discussion at my F2F book club, but I can't give it more than 3 stars because I didn't connect with Eilis. That is intentional, I think, on the author's part. Eilis is written as a very cautious young woman, who keeps her thoughts and emotions carefully hidden from others - including the reader. The result is a book that I appreciate but don't ""love.""",2011-07-02 14:48:06,Brooklyn,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance,Colm Toibin

 Two minor complaints: 
 1. He does this thing where he starts talking about the next chapter's themes or subject matter at the end of the previous chapter. It started to grate on my nerves by the end of the book, because it was so unnecessary, like a next, on TREVOR NOAH'S MEMOIR tagged on to a thematically different set of stories. 
 2. His stories about his friend Hitler are funny and thought-provoking, but I think it's disappointing that he doesn't give even a sentence over to discovering that Hitler's name was incredibly offensive to people in other parts of the world, or coming to understand why chanting ""Go, Hitler! Go, Hitler!"" would stop a dance show in a Jewish school.  He writes with clarity on the reasons Hitler isn't history's greatest monster for peoples who suffered other atrocities. However, I think that including a line or two about the way his understanding of the Jewish school story changed over time would have kept the incisive point while showing a little more compassion all around. It also left the story feeling a little unfinished for me. He obviously understands now why things ended the way they did--so when did that happen? 
 Highly recommend the audiobook, perhaps to the exclusion of the printed editions.

(Interestingly, I notice other covers for Laura Lamont's Life in Pictures delete the cigarette in hand which did not in any way contribute to my feelings of glamour!) The cover is a little misleading, as while a good part of the protagonist's time is spent in Hollywood, this is more of a family drama/life story than glamour. There not many descriptions of lavish dinners and premieres or exotic locales. This is the Hollywood that chews you up and spits you out. 
 Laura Lamont begins life as plain Elsa Emerson, youngest child of three in Wisconsin. The only thing not 100% normal in her life is that her parents run a theatre in their barn every summer. Wannabe actors and actresses come from near and far to tread the boards. For Elsa, this is what life is - new people to meet every summer and as she grows older, small parts.

Irving Green renames her Laura Lamont, changes her hair colour and a star is born. A quick divorce, an Oscar and the former Elsa is on the road to fame and fortune. But missed opportunities and tragic events bring Laura down. Will she recover to return to her Golden Era? 
 I felt that Hollywood and acting played a somewhat minor role in this book - it was more about Elsa/Laura (after her name change, Elsa is only very occasionally referred to by that name - it's a little confusing initially) and her life. I found her heyday in 1930s-1950s Hollywood to be very interesting as the actors were 'owned' by the studio. They only worked in the pictures for the studio they were contracted to, with very little way as to what they were cast in. Laura's 'loaning' to another studio is interesting to read about too. The backdrop of the studios (literally a town with school, hospital and dance classes available) was interesting and I wish it had been utilised more often. As Laura's children grow, the focus is more on her as a mother, encouraging them and admonishing them. To me, this is where Laura Lamont lost some of her sparkle - she was just like any other mother with the same hopes and insecurities. 
 The rise of Laura's friend Ginger along a very steep trajectory was an interesting comparison to Laura's career. Could Laura have obtained that if she'd decided to be the funny one? Laura seemed to be stuck in her early success, while Ginger trail blazed her way to the top, writing the rules for women as she went. Laura seems to pale more and more as Ginger shines. This leaves her financially bankrupt and without any form of career, reduced to being a secretary. The funny thing is that the devastation didn't really hit Laura the way I thought it would - she seems a little bland and accepting that things are going to be terrible. 
 The story does end on a tinge of hope, but the majority is devoted to family rather than the Hollywood days, which was disappointing. If Laura was a stronger character, this may have been more interesting. But her life just seemed to fall into calamities one after another with very little reaction. The writing was strong (Straub's narrative carrying me though to finish this) but I didn't feel I cared for Laura enough. Did she devote her whole life to living as her sister did? Did she decide at the end to live her own life? To be honest, I wasn't really fussed what happened.

 Two-second recap: 
 In the third and final book in the Katerina trilogy, author Robin Bridges brings together Katerina and the forces of light and dark, for one final confrontation. The resulting drama, romance and intrigue, will have readers on the edge of their seats, reading frantically until the very end. 
 *** 
 Intro: 
 Sometimes, there are serendipitous moments in reading. 
 Back when I was living in London, I found a copy of The Gathering Storm that someone had accidentally left on the Tube. I started reading the book during my commute, and immediately fell in love. 
 The Gathering Storm had everything I wanted in a good story: Russian history (with a slight twist!), the paranormal and a smart, level-headed heroine with admirable goals and ambitions. My love of the world that Robin Bridges had created only increased, when I got my hands on The Unfailing Light. 
 So when I was given the opportunity to host the final (!) stop for the third and final book in the series, The Morning Star, I responded ""YES!"" so quickly and with so much enthusiasm, I think I may have seriously amused Nicole, the publicist in charge of the series. 
 What follows is a review of The Morning Star that is deliberately vague, because I both want to show my love for the book, but I don't want to spoil anything for newcomers to the series. 
 *** 
 Things that worked: 
 * The characterizations 
 Over the course of three books, Robin Bridges has done a fantastic job of developing Katerina from a smart but less-than-worldly student, into a intelligent, thoughtful woman who is on the verge of a great destiny. 
 Katerina's had several years (and three books) now to solidify her conviction to become a doctor, but she's also had three books time to understand who she is as a person. She's become more aware of her powers, the responsibilities that she has to herself, her family, the two courts and to the rest of the world. 
 She's also become even more compassionate, and more aware. Even though Katerina is frequently put into situations where people are trying to take advantage of her, she doesn't hold grudges. There is one scene in the latter half of the book, where she forgives a character for repeatedly putting her into harm's way, and tries her best to make things right for that character, just because she knows it's the right thing to do. 
 If I were a parent or an educator, I would definitely point Katerina out to my child or students, as a fine example of someone who embraces her differences and uses them to make the world a smarter, stronger and better place. 
 As for the secondary characters, they're incredibly rich in their own right. I was especially taken with the subtleties and complexities that Bridges wove into Danilo's character journey. In the hands of anyone else, he could have easily come off as a one-note villain, continuously determined to prevent Katerina from her goals and ambitions. 
 But in Bridges's world, she makes it clear that a character like Danilo has his own motivations, ambitions and even a humorous personality, which has just unfortunately been overshadowed by the desire for power. He becomes sympathetic and relatable throughout most of The Morning Star, which I think is an absolute testament to the strength of Bridges's writing. 
 * The relationship between George and Katerina 
 I've read quite a number of YA books in my time, featuring all sorts of romantic relationships between the protagonist and their respective love interest(s). 
 However, throughout the course of The Katerina trilogy and in The Morning Star in particular, Bridges does something completely different from all of the other YA books I've read before with her main romantic pairing: she solidifies the idea that the relationship between Katerina and George is truly a partnership. 
 They love each other, but more importantly, they mutually support each other. George and Katerina not only work well together defeating the forces of evil, but they also cheer on each other's slightly less supernatural-orientated ambitions and dreams. 
 They're both willing to make the type of sacrifices that will help the other one's goals come true, whether it's George doing whatever he can to help Katerina become a doctor at great personal cost, or Katerina doing whatever it takes to heal him. 
 I'm normally not the type of person to say to an educator or parent, ""Hey, tell your student/kid to read this book, for good examples of healthy, smart relationships,"" but I'll make an exception in this case. Tell your student/kid/neighbor/whomever to read this book, because the relationship between Katerina and George is just so smart, level-headed and healthy. 
 * The writing 
 From a world-building perspective, Robin's writing is literally dripping with details. The reader can see everything about St. Petersburg, from the dusty, crowded street car that Katerina takes to visit the Tibetan doctor, to the ornate tarot cards that she and her mother shuffle when she's at home. 
 Between the descriptions of the objects and the scenery, Robin has also taken the time to weave in both historical and fantastical details that shows that Katerina's world is very similar to ours, but with that detailed, paranormal edge. Readers will appreciate the amount of careful detail that Bridges shows in explaining how Katerina's world of dueling courts, dark and light fae, intersects with the mythological/paranormal elements of other cultures, especially Egyptian mythology. 
 * The plotting 
 The plotting in The Morning Star is beautifully complex. 
 On the one hand, it moves incredibly quickly. Bridges wastes no time in throwing the reader into the story, skillfully including sentences or dialogue that helps readers recollect events that have happened before. As she catches readers up, she occasionally also throws in a revelation or plot twist, which will make the reader sit up and take notice. 
 On the other hand, the book also moves slowly at certain points, e.g. when Katerina travels to Egypt. Through the journey, Katerina (and the reader) are slowly caught up again on why it is that she's on this trip, and what led her here in the first place. It gives readers the downtime to truly enjoy the world that Bridges has created. 
 However, this eventually leads to... 
 * The ending 
 Without giving any spoilers away, the ending is a perfect closure to all of the court drama, dreams, hopes, romances and tragedies of the three books. 
 After a nerve-wrecking climax - including an epic battle that will rival any fictional battles that have come before, there's a closure to the finale - which is a bit warm and fuzzy, but still perfect - which will make the readers feel like they've experienced a full, complete character journey. 
 Things that didn't work/Things to consider: 
 My one minor quibble with The Morning Star is that I wish that it was longer! Robin Bridges has built such a beautiful, detailed and complex world, I would love to spend more time in it. 
 In fact, Robin has created such a great cast of characters, I think that it would be easy for her to write prequels or sequels for any of the characters we've met throughout the course of the trilogy. 
 (*Hint hint* Robin!) 
 For future editions, I would also love for a family tree of the cast of characters to be included in the book. Bridges does an excellent job of detailing who's who over the course of three books, but unless you read the three books together, it does occasionally take a second to remember the relationship between each characters. 
 *** 
 Final verdict: 
 The Morning Star is a spectacular, fitting end to the Katerina trilogy. It fulfills unanswered questions, ties together loose ends, and gives the reader an ending, which has been three books in the making. 
 I highly recommend The Morning Star for YA historical fans who enjoy books filled with rich, glorious details, and want to spend time in a world that will make their imaginations soar. I also recommend The Morning Star (and the Katerina trilogy) for fans of Libba Bray's Gemma Doyle trilogy, and fans of Russian literature.""",2013-02-14 18:13:58,"The Morning Star (Katerina, #3)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance,Robin Bridges

You know the ones, the ones that make you cry so hard you've got snot coming out of your nose, your eyes are all red and you're cursing the author with every breath you take? Yeah A Love Letter to Whiskey was one of those for me. 
 This book took my breath away. It shattered my heart, stitched it back together only to shatter it again not just once, but a couple of times. The relationship between Brecks and Jaime is both beautiful and heartbreaking to experience. It left me feeling raw and tender. I held my husband a little tighter that night. Brecks, or B as she prefers to be called, is at times feisty and a times vulnerable. Her childhood perceptions were shattered one night and she's still reeling from the revelations. Jaime was sexy as hell. He was athletic, had his life plan figured out, and when he saw something he wanted he went after it. The push and pull between them, the chemistry, was off the charts and combustible. 
 This is not an easy book to read, its gut wrenching and angst-filled. But it's filled with beauty in its own way. Steiner showed that even though love isn't always pretty and wrapped up in a bow, it's absolutely breathtaking in its beauty, its strength and its ability to forgive. This is definitely one of my top ten books of the year, if not in my top five. I recommend everyone reads this book; we all need a sip of Whiskey.

 Inside the Dome, Patridge has taken his father's place as leader of the Pures. His struggle has led him here, intent upon bringing down the Dome from the inside, with the help of a secret resistance force. But things are not as simple from his new position of power and he finds himself tempted by his father's words: perhaps if the world is to survive it needs the Dome - and Partridge - to rule it... 
 So here we are at the end of a much loved (by me) trilogy which started with the superb ""Pure"" and continued with ""Burn"". I am terribly sad to see it go, but at the same time am extremely pleased to note that I have loved the entire thing. For different reasons in each book perhaps but there has been no falling at the last hurdle and no disappointment. 
 In ""Burn"" Julianna Baggott skilfully pulls on all the threads that have woven together this world and puts the onus firmly on her characters - what sort of a life will they choose for themselves? What will they decide is important? In that way it is somewhat different from the first two instalments, and gives it an almost perfect finish. How the previous events affect them, their judgement, their life choices, in a way saying ""yes you have been through a lot. Now choose your path"" 
 Of course there is a lot more revelation and mythology building surrounding that basis as we follow on directly from the ending of Burn which left Partridge and Pressia both having made impossible choices for very different reasons. The one thing that I DEFINITELY love about the trilogy is this pair. They are not the only wonderful characters to pepper the pages, but they are my first loves and the reason why I kept reading... 
 Add to that an absolutely fascinating world with hidden beauty and danger and you have a complete package that makes up a fantastic reading experience. 
 All in all its a great finish. Not my favourite of the three - I think ""Fuse"" takes that prize, but I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this as a most terrific post apocalyptic, dystopian joy of a YA read overall. Start with ""Pure"". You won't regret it.

 Layla LaBelle is your typical student, with typical cares- boyfriends, nemesis, bestfriends, over-bearing parent and dancing class. 
 but one thing is different about her, one thing that makes her think that above all she belongs in a psych ward. She hallucinates. 
 Her hallucinations are of her when she was young running in a field holding the hand of a young boy, laughing. She remembers every detail, she remembers the love she had/s for him. She remembers being best friend with such a boy. Max, that is the name her heart cries. 
 only one problem. 
 Max doesn't exist. 
 Her Mother is adamant that Max has been and always was a figment of her imagination. 
 But her heart tells her differently. 
 Her soul tells her differently. 
 And when she bumps into a young man that looks like Max's twin, a power burns within her soul. 
 All she has ever known is a lie, all she has been told is a lie. 
 The Celtic Gods are real, their descents? real. Their powers? real. 
 but so are their enemies. 
 the fire born prophesy has never before been so potent. 
 A raven from the fire will awaken and in their wake, the ashes of war will scatter. 
 I really liked this book, which is huge for me to say considering the whole notion of 'soul-mates' to me has been so overdone, that i tend to dislike the idea itself now. But I actually like this romance. 
 And warning, a romance it is. Very much of a lovey-dovey, with war and powers type of story. 
 The idea of Direct descendants of the Gods of ancient Ireland/ the celtic Gods is so fascinating! I really appreciated this idea. We usually get the typical daughter of Zeus or Poseidon etc. but this time we get celtic gods a major plus in my book. 
 In here we have everything from the fae-folk, to the other world, gargoyles, demons, fallen angels. 
 It's quite entertaining! 
 I will admit that there were a few moments that Layla really got on my nerves, and i face-palmed like a boss, but the writing in this book is so good, that i shrugged it off. 
 McMann knows how to write and engage readers, that's for sure! I love the concept of the person you are destined to love is the person who was born to be your sworn enemy. That you were only meant to bump into them on the battlefield making both leaders too weak to fight off attacks. I mean, that's genius!  
 (Read that spoiler at your own risk!) 
 I really enjoyed this story and the ending had me holding my breath! Good thing I already have the next book eh? 
 Stay awesome!

 Actual Rating- A whooping 3.5 Stars! 
 Welcome to New Venice, the first good thing to come of the Secessionary War! 
 A war decimated the world. The survivors came together and thus began the formation of The Unified Countries. 
 There is One government. There is a new civilization hub, New Venice. 
 New Venice is where all the great scientific advancements are made, they are in essence the utopian society...on the outside. 
 On the Inside, Treachery abounds and Terrorist arise...or so it seems. 
 Can War ever really end? 
 ""The thing you have to remember."" [she] continues with a far-distant look in her eyes, ""Is that in the end, all war does is kill people."" 
 ""It reminds me; the war is never over. We can't stop fighting."" 
 Except, what is a utopian society fighting? 
 Ella one day, visits the groveyard (A sort of Graveyard, personally this idea to me was brilliant! Read to find out what I mean.) 
 In the Groveyard, she meets a young man, she does not recognize him, but he recognizes her and warns her against the very people she trusts with her life. Why should she listen to him? 
 ""Someone's made you forget me, Ella"" [he] says sadly. 
 But who could possibly exert such power to wipe a single person from her mind? 
 You guessed my answer- Read to find out :P 
 Okay my opinion- I actually enjoyed this book quiet a bit. 
 I love a futuristic dystopia and this author has one superb imagination, 
 I mean Reverie Mental Spa? Hebb's Disease? CuffLINK? 
 That's awesome! 
 It lost a few points to me because i felt like it was a bit repetitive in terms of the character's actions. Also, while I know technically she couldn't help it, but treating a person who continually saves your life like crap, isn't going to make you very liked! *clears throat* 
 There is a bit of a romance, I don't know why...I fully expected this to be a full blown romantic love fest. It wasn't. The Romance while it's there, it's actually pretty minimal and I actually felt slightly disappointed that there wasn't more of it...I know. Me saying that? that's crazy! 
 However, I think this is worth a read, the world-building is stunning and its just a very creative book. 
 Plot twists are continuous and not easy to guess! So that's great! 
 Stay awesome!

She still can't choose between fellow fledgling Erik or her human ex-boyfriend, Heath, whom she's Imprinted with.

 I found this book to be a great deal more interesting than the first book in the series. I think, for the most part, this was due to the tension between characters and the action scenes being more consistent. In the first book, I know it bothered me that the pace was so slow and that the only real action occurred near to the end of the book. In this book, there was action throughout. I still find Laurence to be a relatively boring and stuffy main character, but I admire his loyalty. I'm a much more cynical person and I feel like Laurence is sometimes content to believe the best in people when he'd do much better to mean the worst of them. If they had outed Yongxing as the mastermind of an attempted murder and done away with him on the ship, they would have saved themselves a helluva lot of time and trouble. And it's not like China would have been mad if Temeraire had eaten him, since the Celestials are practically royal family in China. 
 I was wary of the Chinese aspect of the story being too absurd, but it seemed relatively decent to me. I'm no historian, unfortunately, but the only things that seemed unusual to me can easily be blamed on the historical inclusion of dragons in the foundations of the culture. I'm also not Chinese, so my knowledge is limited in that respect as well. 
 I still think, as far as books go, her writing is descriptive to the point that it gets slow (seriously, we had to read several pages of Laurence being mad they were bringing his dragon meals they'd cooked and describing them). I'd love it if certain bits weren't dragged out quite so much as they were. It would make things a whole lot more fun to read. (Seriously, we get it. He likes the cooked foods with spices.

1220,23995290,4,"""Before I share my thoughts on this book, I need to say that I read this on my Kindle. Those of you who use e-readers know that you can see how much of the book you have remaining. I got my copy through my library system and was merrily reading along, 77% of the book completed, just finished a chapter and flipped to the next page and saw the words ""The End."" 
 Noooooooooooooooooooo! 
 I did not realize that the last 23% of the book was the novella: The Dire Earth. 
 I wasn't ready for the story to be end! A sign saying: ""Road Ends"" would have been nice, but no Jason, you let me slam into a concrete wall at highway speed! 
 So, anyway, Zero World by Jason M. Hough (rhymes with cough, through, tough, and bough). I really enjoyed the Dire Earth trilogy. So I went into this book with very high expectations, and I am very pleased to say that those expectations were met. 
 Hough must type at 600 words per minute because he writes books with very fast paced adventures. I've read each of his published books with a ""just one more chapter"" mentality that leads to a very real inability to put them down. 
 Peter Caswell, the protagonist, is a Jason Bourne-esque hero whose memory is erased after each mission. This allows him to live a ""normal"" life with no emotional baggage from the things he has done while on a mission hanging over his head. He gets sent with a team to investigate a space ship that has been missing for 12 years. While he is there, his handler gives him new orders saying, ""This will be the most interesting mission you'll ever forget."" 
 What follows is a combination 1950's era spy thriller / first contact / parallel worlds / conspiracy story with more James Bond action than you can shake a very large stick at. Hough keeps the cast of characters very small allowing you to spend a lot of time riding around in their heads, getting comfortable with them. As the story moves along, you get to thinking you know where the story is going. It is then that Hough pulls back another veil and the plot thickens, as they say. 
 I really, really, really liked this book . . . Except for the sudden stop at the end. 
 Now I really do hope he types like the wind so we get the next installment sooner.""",2015-12-24 18:13:57,Zero World,fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;fantasy;paranormal,Jason M. Hough

 Calder and Felicity have an instant attraction, insta-love is one of Alexa Riley's specialities. I really love that even though they have this instant desire, there is separation for lengths of time before things escalate between them. It's a perfect way to add angst without shoving a bunch of filler information to weigh down the story.

 End of the Innocence by Alessandra Torre is book three in the series, this is not a stand-alone and if unless you want to be thoroughly confused AND short-change yourself you absolutely want to read books one and two before stripping off your panties and dry humping this book. I have to say that I am head over heels in love with this series, author, book, characters, all of it. If I could take them all home and keep them forever and ever I would. I know we are still early in the year, but I would almost put money on this series remaining my number one for 2014. I know what you are thinking, ""big words book whore, big words."" Well, yeah, it is, but if you haven't read it yet... you haven't met Brad De Luca yet. 
 ""I'm not ever, as long as I live, going to have an orgasm without your hand on my cock, your mouth on my lips."" 
 Mm. Brad De Luca gets down and dirty between the sheets. He is one of the best dirty talkers in the BBF world. And he is irrevocably in love with his Julia. Their relationship is full of sexual tension, release, emotional angst, and drama from outside forces. The book is the perfect marriage between erotic smut and dramatic flair. Not to mention the naughty little secret Mr. De Luca has (No, I won't tell because for those of you who haven't read book one yet, this is something best found out on your own.) 
 I adore Julia. She's such a strong female character. I liked her really from the very beginning of book one and each scene from there just endeared me more to the spitfire. I love that even though she is a very strong-willed character she's still soft enough to offset the serious alpha-man tendencies Brad has. The author did an awesome job finding balance between the two. As the series has progressed Julia has had a sexual awakening of sorts... so it was kind of interesting to watch her grow and change from what she thought she needed to satisfy her sexually to what she REALLY needs/wants/desires. 
 ""I loved to suck his cock. I loved the taste of it. It tasted of need. Of raw, animal want, and never failed to cause a twinge in my stomach, a weight of arousal in my sex."" 
 She becomes quite the wanton slut for her man. I love it! 
 This is a definite must read. Without a doubt this book gets FIVE stars for an amazing storyline and if I had more than FIVE drenched panties I would throw several more pairs at this one... maybe a blindfold too. Hubba Hubba!

1223,18880307,5,"""Review for Renegade Lady by Dawn Martens and Emily Minton 
 Renegade Lady is the first book in a new MC series by Emily Minton and Dawn Martens, I have to say it is probably going to be by far my favorite work from either author to date. Alright, so I am partial to sexy biker men and badass biker bitches... so shoot me. Or give me to Reese, he can punish me. Hubba, hubba. 
 I really enjoyed the direction that the authors went with the MC world. There are several books out there right now and not many of them get into the nitty gritty of it all. I liked that while the MC did deal with illegal stuff, they also have legitimate businesses that keep them in the black. Another thing I liked was the morality factor the Renegades have... while they do bad things, most are not unprovoked and they maintain a genuine respect for people. They have a moral compass. 
 I think the characters were well developed and as a whole the relationships are clearly defined, which makes it easy to follow even though you are introduced to a lot of people throughout the story. I know most everyone will say that they fell in love with Kidd, and I did too, don't get me wrong. But I have a serious sweet spot for Reese, Timber, and Chipper. Honestly, don't know who I would pick of those three if I had a choice to be one of their Old Ladies. Total swoonfest. 
 Jenna or ""Ice"" had a rough childhood. Her father kept her mother on a string, even though he didn't seem to want her permanently. Jenna's dad, Brew, is part of a Renegade chapter that has been having a bit of trouble. When Chipper comes to see what is going on and set things straight he finds Jenna. Appalled by what he sees he makes a choice that will forever change Jenna's life, he takes her home and makes her his. No, not in the way you think, you see Jenna is just a kid... he adopts this lost girl and gives her a home like she had never known before. (Now you see why I love Chipper?) 
 Kidd is Chipper's little brother and the current VP of the Renegades. He finds himself drawn to the scrawny girl and they form a friendly relationship. Personally, I love the early days when they are like BFFs... it shows the softer side of Kidd and Jenna before Ice. However, I do want to note that I really appreciated that the authors gave Jenna a backbone. She's no wilting flower and it's about damn time female main characters are allowed to let their bitch flags fly. 
 Their relationship is one that will have you panting and pulling your hair out at the same time. There were several moments that I felt like I could reach inside my Kindle and knock their heads together, but that's just par for the course with these dramatic alpha personalities. If you enjoy biker books, you'll love this one. And even though the smutty parts aren't as in depth as some, they give just enough to make you pant. You whorish ones know I love my smut... and I wasn't a bit disappointed. The level of kinky dirty worked perfectly with the writing style and the characters. 
 Renegade Lady gets 4.5 stars for storyline and 4 drenched panties for smut. There were a couple things that kept me from giving a full five stars, like Ice being a club whore... I just don't think that the club VP's 'daughter' would ever be allowed to be a whore. There were a couple other things, but I refuse to do spoilers so I won't mention them. 
 I can't wait to read more about my Reese and Timber... yes, MINE.

 Book provided by publisher for honest review. 
 As you whores know I love paranormal romance, it's one of my book whore weaknesses. This book left me wanting more! I am so glad to know that it is a series, the author did an amazing job at making me feel like I got a full story in just a novella length book.

 It left me wanting more, but not in that disappointed kind of way. In the ohmigod I must read more of this series! I love dragons! HOLY CRAP this is sooo good kind of way. I give this one 4 stars for storyline and 4 wet panties for smut. Yummy. So, to not ruin any of the story I am not going to get into the characters or the plot in my review... no spoilers! However, I will tell you the characters are extremely well developed and the author manages to give you back story, present, and a look to what the future might hold for these characters in this novella.

 Not in looks. 
 Not in what they say.

 The Book Thief is one of my favorite books ever (if not my favorite book ever), then how is it possible that I loved I Am the Messenger even more? 
 This book is just... beautiful, from start to finish. I'm not really good at putting my thoughts into words so I know that nothing I could ever say will bring this book justice (but that still won't stop me from trying). 
 First of all, it took me a long time to read this book, but it wasn't the books fault. I had to study for a test to get into college (I got accepted, YAY!), so my reading had to suffer from it. But even that didn't stop me from enjoying this book completely. I think if I had the time I would finish it in one sitting. 
 At the beginning, I thought that I was reading just an ordinary book, with ordinary characters and their ordinary lives. But now, that I've finished it, I can say that this book is anything but ordinary. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me angry, and at the ending it left me feeling emotionally drained, but also really happy (if that makes any sense). It really touched me, and made me think about things that I (and a lot of us) just take for granted. I can't count the times when I've read a quote from this book that made me stop reading and just think about it for a few seconds. 
 And the ending is the reason that I ended up liking this book even more than the The Book Thief. I'm not gonna say anything about the ending, except that it blew my mind and that I still get goosebumps thinking about it. 
 So I think that's enough from me, cause I feel like if I continue I'll start getting emotional, and I wouldn't want that.

I wasn't sold on some of the supporting cast but I felt the chemistry and connection was really strong between the leads even if some of the transitions in the early scenes seemed a little awkward. But it was easy to get swept up in the couple even when the outside drama became a bit of an annoyance. However it wasn't until the last 40-45% where I checked out.

And unfortunately the big break-up felt.. I don't know, too manufactured to be believed, which is ironic in a way I don't want to spoil. I do quite like this main core of characters, Grady now being added to the Zack, Nolan and Max crew, so I'm still willing to read on. The lack of chemistry in book one wasn't the issue here but book one felt more well-rounded and complete than this one. Maybe book three will be the winner? Third time's the charm.

1234,28963772,1,"""So, I feel kind of betrayed. Maybe a lot betrayed. And definitely tricked. 
 I picked up this book because I have no idea why, really. It was in my feed, I loved the premise, and that was that. I thought this would be a fun read. I was wrong. 
 Many of my friends know how I feel about KA. And as a result I avoid her writing. I don't like her, she probably doesn't like my reviews (not that she'd ever stoop to checking them, I'm just saying in general she probably wishes I would stop reading her books, too) and so we continue to happily exist without crossing paths. I also try (keyword : try) to keep my KA feelings to myself because so many of my bookish buds love her. So colour me surprised when this book reads like a KA book after the introduction of the male POV. And then doesn't.. let.. the.. fuck.. up. 
 I'm sorry but if I wanted to read a book by that author I would've picked up a book by that author. I felt safe in my little world of avoidance. But now.. now nothing is safe. Because how can I know I won't accidentally find myself in the same situation again! 
 Okay, I'm getting a little bit drama-llama in this review but I think you get my point. 
 Any enjoyment and interest I had in the first 90 pages was obliterated by the similarities and the glaringly obvious mimicry of another author. I pushed on, though, because there were these little moments where it seemed like I could see the real Daniels. But it was overshadowed by the ghost of KA. Probably more than a ghost. A bloody poltergeist. 
 It's bad enough to suffer through an author you don't like. But it's even worse when those same things you hate are then being shamelessly copied by another. 
 I have book two on hold with my library and I will give it a chance. Jamie, who is to be the protag in the following installment, did not read like a KA alphajerk in this one -- which was something of a shock as every other male in this book was basically a bloody clone of the same behaviour and speech patterns, not to mention the heroine's strong start was eroded into typical stupid KA heroine behaviour, too -- and I'm willing to throw Daniels a bone and hope she wows me and breaks out of her copycat style. But at the first hint of KA I will drop it like it's hot. 
 I would give this zero stars if I could but I tend to save those for conflicted reads I can't wrap my head around. And there is not one shred of conflict here. I know exactly how I feel.

 Each Shepherd was so real, raw, and intoxicating. Their love for each other and for Blythe is what made this book so hard to put down. 
 Yes it's a love story between Chris and Blythe but it's also a love story between Sabin and Estelle and Eric and Chris and Blythe. 
 The ending was so cheesy cheesy as was the big plot twist at the end. But I was fully expecting it so I was fully ok with it.

 Received an ARC from Netgalley on behalf of Forever Grand Central Publishing in exchange for an honest review. 
 Valerie knows she is curvy and loves it. She has curves in all the right places and a face that is stops-men-in-their-tracks-pretty. Valerie use her sex appeal to get her way, it only works when her brother isn't around. When Brett is there he acts like a junk yard dog, barking and ready to bite anyone that comes near his little sister. The only person Brett trust around Valerie is his best friend Logan. It may seem like Logan Mathis is a big brother figure to Valerie, but his thoughts and constant fantasies are so far from brotherly it would be illegal. Valerie has also been harboring a crush on Logan since she was younger. Now she is 26 and a woman that knows how to get the attention she wants, she doesn't hold anything back when trying to get Logan's attention. 
 Valerie's character is portrayed as a strong independent woman who knows what she likes and what she wants. What she wants is Logan and no one else. She has tried for the past eight years to move on from the constant desire she harbors for Logan, but to no avail. So when Logan moves back into town and opens up a new bar, Valerie knows she is going to see him sooner or later; and later being more ideal for her. Once their paths do cross she sees that Logan is in a bind with his employees and offers her assistance. Well, she more jumps over the bar counter and beings making a spectacle with her mad mixology talents. 
 Logan knows he needs the help. He needs to come up with $10,000 in less than a month to help save his moms house. He knows he can do it, but not if he is short staffed and in desperate need of bartenders. Having Valerie working for him, he knows is a BIG mistake, because he can't keep his eyes or his hands away from her. Now he has to figure out which of the two problems is more important to deal with. Should he keep his distances, just like he has been doing for over 8 years; or, does he just finally give into his desires for Valerie and possible ruin a life long friendship with Brett? 
 Valerie and Logan are cute with heated passion. You can tell that they are ""horny"" for one another and when they finally give in, it explodes across the pages. It was entertaining seeing these two bicker and fight. At times I didn't like Logan's character because he would interrupt Valerie while she was talking, and I don't mean here and there. It was like constantly. Drove me nuts. I wish she just put some duct tape over his mouth and tell him to shut up so she could finish a sentences. Brett was similar. Logan and Brett would always act like they knew better and would make assumptions about people. Well we know what they say about those who assume (make an ass at of you and me). Brett and Logan at many times made themselves look like complete hot-headed-fools. Boys having to pee on what they say is theirs. HA! 
 I enjoyed how the ending came full circle for Logan and Valerie. They each learned new lessons about themselves and each other. I think the story was cute and fun. It has some ""heated"" scenes for you romancers out there. 
 Overall I give the book a 4 star rating. It would be a fun summer read on the beach. Enjoy my lovers!""",2017-05-28 19:57:10,On the Plus Side (A Perfect Fit #2),romance;fiction,Alison Bliss

1241,13449677,1,"""Ugh. Well this book started OK but veered off into insane levels of stupid decisions and cringy scenes! 
 I actually hated all the characters in this book. Anyway I'm stubborn and will tend to give most books a chance, generally I just skip the parts I can't bear...but this book had so much good press before the publication I just kept on going, I think this book is the reason I gave up giving up smoking. 
 Dante was this rip off bad boy wannabe that never really did anything very bad. 
 Charlie was annoying, as were her friends. I felt like she was a bad friend to them as well. The scene where they went to Vegas was so cheesy and full of so many unexplained plot holes, it made me want to burn my cigarette into my eyes until i was blinded. How did they get into the club, surely they where underage? WTF was up with the embarrassing makeovers they all got? Who the fuck does Dante think he is? WHY WAS HE IN LOVE WITH CHARLIE COOPER? It made no sense to me, it did not fit with his personality at all. 
 I found her insipid and dumb, her goodwill side didn't come across as that believable either. it was just stated, like: 'she is very not hot but a very good person.' and 'he is very hot and bad, but in a sexy way.' 
 and then suddenly he loves her 
 OK ACTUALLY I take back what i said... Dante Walker is a dick, he is incredibly judgmental and cruel about Charlies looks in the first place. That wasn't nice and certainly not 'badboy' sexy, just immature! oh my god give me my anger meds now. 
 AND why was Dante the best tagger ever; leading the other six, when there were only half a dozen taggers anyway and he had only been dead for a few years? SURELY THE DEVIL COULD FIND A BETTER CANDIDATE THAN THIS SAPPY TEENAGE DIRTBAG?! SURELY?!!! 
 Why are there so few 'taggers' and why are most of them in effing America? Did i just misunderstand a large part of the deal there? If so please tell me, because I am hoping I am wrong and she meant there happened to be six in the USA. I could deal with that. I still don't get why Dante is His main guy...I am not a believer but I still think that the Devil himself is a bit smarter than that sort of oversight/better judge of character...because Dante turned out to be soft. in the head. 
 I think you have make the paranormal stuff plausible to human nature for it to be believable and i just am so hung up on the the fact that the devil would have had so many better candidates for tagging than Dante. This BS about charlie's amazing future was also unbelievable, and what Charlie did with her contract from Dante made me completely furious! Her eventual break down was out of the blue and did not fit with the rest of the chapters. I did not feel like there was any chemistry between them either. 
 Just no. I am furious thinking about this book and it was ages since i read it. FURIOUS. I do not believe anyone could possibly enjoy this book. I understand the author put part of her soul into the book and deserves at least constructive advice, but then I can see that this author used public websites like these to promote herself and her book to get the unwarranted excitement she received before publication, and i'm am just trying to bring about some balance. 
 Any way i'm not usually this raging about a book, I actually really can not explain my anger, but... well:

1242,19057,4,"""I picked up this book because I was looking for a simple and undemanding read. However, as you can see from the rating I gave it, I Am the Messenger proved to be a lot more than that. 
 First of all, a premise: I am usually wary of the YA genre, because you can never know what to expect from it in terms of quality. Under this label fall a plethora of very different stories, and there have been some widely renowned novels which I've found a bit overrated. Lucky for me, this was not the case. 
 I Am the Messenger proved to be a story with surprising depth, and I often found myself moved by the results of Ed's messages. It's quite a well thought-out story, mixing mystery and action to friendship and character growth. It also has some very funny moments, and on the whole it's a thoroughly enjoyable read. The style is simple and colloquial, but it also features some interesting choice of vocabulary: for example, I definitely wouldn't have expected to find a word like ""sanctimonious"" in it! 
 As I've said, I'm not the biggest fan of YA novels, but this one has definitely won itself a place among my favourites of the genre, and I would fully recommend it!""",2013-07-18 10:28:54,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak
1243,15797848,2,"""** spoiler alert ** 
 Consider yourself warned for spoilers. 
 I feel horrible saying this but I'm definitely disappointed in this book. I have to start by saying that I'm not really one who reads or watches a lot of horror but I was expecting so much more from this one. There were a few points in this one where I was truly creeped out but mostly it was actually kind of boring. I wish the suspense had been built a little more/better. A great horror story really keeps the readers in suspense for most of the book, right on the edge of their seats, but I just did not feel that in this book. 
 One of the main problems for that was that I just didn't care at all about any of the characters. I had a hard time connecting to the main character because so much about her was kept a secret and by the time the secret was revealed, it was a huge let-down after so much waiting. And I had no strong feelings for the LI either. It's so strange that an author who's other books I loved because of the characters could write a book where I literally cared about none of the characters. They had brief mentions of interesting pasts but both seemed so bland otherwise that there wasn't much to care about. And then they'd go off and make out. There was no romance, no swoon. Just a sort of attraction based on finding each other different from everyone else. And that's it. I'm so sad because I really do love romances and I think some of her past romances were really good but this one, I just couldn't figure out at all why it was in this book or why I should care about it at all. 
 And the rest of the characters were given such brief time on the page that I barely remember them. Even the killer, we barely meet him before so it isn't even all that shocking when the reveal comes, which is about halfway into the book. It wasn't someone close to either of the MCs nor someone important to the community. There was literally nothing surprising about him, except that he was barely mentioned beforehand. Also, the killings, while truly gruesome, were also not any of the characters we were spending time with. As with a lot of crime shows, the new chapter would start out talking about a character we'd never seen before so you automatically know that person is going to die. 
 I know I don't read or watch a lot of horror, so maybe this is more typical for YA horror books, but mostly I'm just disappointed because I felt almost nothing while reading the book. I even almost gave up after the first 100 pages. Luckily, it picked up a bit about halfway through and I read the second half much faster than the first half but still, I wanted to feel like I couldn't put the book down at all. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat and fear for the MC and wonder who the killer was and be completely shocked when it was someone close to her. Or maybe even her?! But it wasn't. 
 I do think this might be a good intro for teens into the horror genre. They might love it. I remember watching Scream as a teen and being completely freaked out. I haven't seen it in years but this definitely had a similar feel to that. So maybe I'm just not the right audience for something like this. I just wish I wasn't so disappointed by it.""",2014-10-11 08:46:53,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins

1245,13872,5,"""Katherine Dunn's magnus opus. What is a better way to find your own freakshow than creating your own!? This is exactly what Al and Lilian Binewski did through a series of medication and radiation, together they produced Arturo the Aqua Boy with flippers as limbs; Electra and Iphigenia the conjoined twins; Olympia the albino dwarf hunchback and Fortunato, a child with telekinetic power.The novel is actually composed of two eras, the first being what happened in the Binewski family and the second being Olympia's quest on rescuing her daughter from a sadistic woman who disfigures women so that she could ""reach their potential"". 
 The novel is darkly humourous and crafty, I actually learnt quite a few new words from reading this novel. The novel is not for those with a weak stomach as it contains mutilation, incest, rape, murder and sexual fetishes. It certainly wasn't an easy read due to the jumping of narrative and the language used in the novel.

1246,186074,3,"""This book was certainly an enjoyable read as there is an interesting main character (Kvothe) and an intriguing fantasy land. However, completing this book left me wholly unsatisfied, quite like how The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey left me feeling. There were captivating moments filled with action and mystery but many more moments of fluff, needed to pad the book out to a trilogy (much like Peter Jackson and his three movie long adaptation of one book). 
 Plot 
 In short, there isn't much of a plot in this book. This only felt like the first act--setting the scene, introducing the characters, hinting at the conflict (what seems to be the overarching conflict is barely given any page time). Most of this book revolves around Kvothe's childhood and while it certainly is an interesting childhood compared to most people's, it lacks the drive of a compelling novel. I kept my hopes high as I plod through this book, hoping that each new chapter might bring more interesting conflict but ultimately, the most that happens is a few days of hunting the Chandrian and slaying a draccus, only to return to the University and have life go on in approximately the same manner . 
 The plot was the most disappointing part of the book as there really was none. If you're looking for an action-packed fantasy book, then look elsewhere. This book is more akin to meandering down a river and enjoying the pleasant scenery; if that's your cup of tea, then this book will suit you. 
 World 
 The world had so much potential. There were crazy new monsters, entire cultures and societies, histories that could have been explored. Some aspects of this fantasy world were explored but ultimately, I left the book feeling more confused about it. I don't know if this was my own personal problem or if it were the book but I found it really difficult to grasp what kind of world this was. The different places meant nothing to me. The mythical/magical creatures were barely explained. One of the characters, Bast, is fae but I didn't even really know what that meant in the context of this book. Overall, I was thoroughly confused by the world. 
 The book does a good job explaining the places that Kvothe has lived in, from Tarbean to the University and Imre. However, they seem like small parts of the world and left me wanting to know more about the world as a whole. 
 The book alternates between past and present and in present time, a war and troubled times are hinted at but the author does nothing to further develop this! I don't know if this is a deliberate choice and he will explain it in more detail in the following books but it really threw me off. I kept wanting to know more about the world but there would be nothing for me to learn. 
 The magic system is unique but seems extremely complicated as I lack understanding of it even after hundreds of pages. What is the purpose of sympathy??? Of binding objects together??? Honestly, the magic that seemed most confusing to Kvothe (name magic) was the easiest for me to grasp the concept of. 
 Characters 
 Kvothe was sassy and smart, and I enjoyed his character (even if he was so intelligent and clever that many things came on silver platters to him). His struggles were interesting to read about and I loved his cleverness when it came to escaping sticky situations. He could be a tad hotheaded and stubborn sometimes. However, even such an enjoyable character has difficulty shining when most of his struggles have to do with solving his financial troubles and dealing with a rival at school. 
 To be very honest, the story was so centered on Kvothe that all other characters seem extremely secondary to Kvothe. His best friends at school are loyal sidekicks who show up once in a while for some banter with Kvothe. His masters at University are usually only there to either help him or punish him. Bast seems like an apprentice, brother, and old friend, leaving me confused as to his relationship with Kvothe. Denna was a mysterious character with many secrets, teased as a love interest, but never really developed so I would love to know more about her and her past in the coming books. Ambrose is a cardboard cutout asshole. Basically anyone that isn't Kvothe is a pretty standard character or a character with so much mystery surrounding him/her that it's pretty impossible to know anything about him/her. 
 Narration 
 As I said before, this book alternates between past and present. In the present, the book is narrated from omniscient third person and this is how the book starts. I found it quite difficult to get into this as I didn't have one character I could latch on to; instead, I was introduced to a whole cast of minor characters who talk about the happenings of the land as if I could understand anything about it. The beginning definitely put me off and I almost wanted to DNF. 
 Thankfully, most of the book is told from Kvothe's POV as he narrates the story of his childhood. This, too, took some adjusting to get used to. At first, it was a lot of telling and it was hard to feel immersed in the story. However, as the book progressed, there was a lot more showing and I began to get settled in the story. It takes some time but ultimately, the narration isn't a huge hindrance to this story.

The story is told by Kvothe himself to a man collecting tales, and the reader is given the impression that the story does not end well, as Kvothe is now an innkeeper, and there is some sort of mysterious pain in his past that's hinted at but not revealed. 
 Pat Rothfuss is a meticulous writer.

1252,17345218,4,"""I would like to thank Hodder and Stoughton Publishers for this copy of Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy. 
 Here is my honest review. In a nutshell, if you liked the first two Bridget Jones novels, you should enjoy this one. It offers some surprises, when it picks up Bridget Jones' life 13 years later than we last saw her. But it also offers much of the same formula that has worked for author Helen Fielding twice before, following Bridget as she bumbles through her messy, funny life, and tells us about it in her own irrepressible voice. 
 Here is what I liked about the novel. 
 1. I think that Fielding has made a smart choice as an author in having written about Bridget in real time. This means that readers have grown up at the same rate as Bridget. Thus, where 15 years ago, we, and Bridget, were focusing on single life and the start of a career, now Bridget has been married, had two children, and is dealing with the fallout of losing her beloved Mark Darcy. (More on that later.) 
 2. Fielding succeeds yet again at writing a very funny story. I was laughing out loud on nearly every page of the novel. 
 3. The new characters that we encounter in this installment of Bridget's life are loveable and engaging. Bridget's daughter Mabel is funny, sweet, and wise, and the two possible love interests in her life, Roxster and Mr. Wallaker, are both attractive in personality and appearance. 
 4. (And this could be either a good or bad thing, depending on your expectations), Fielding follows a similar story arc in Mad About the Boy as in her first Bridget Jones novel. There are a couple of men who Bridget could possibly end up with, there is some singing to 80's pop, there are some very funny Christmas parties, and there is a happy ending. However, if you were looking for Bridget Jones to mature and change deeply in the years since we've last seen her, you may be disappointed. 
 And this brings me to the ways in which some readers may find Mad About the Boy a bit of a letdown. 
 1. The elephant in the room: Mark Darcy is dead. DEAD! When I first heard this (widely publicized and reacted to by fans) I was very, very upset. Darcy, and Colin Firth as his film embodiment, have become a part of our pop culture. So Fielding's choice to kill this beloved character off was shocking and rather controversial. 
 On the other hand, given this premise, I felt that Fielding handled Darcy's death as well as she possibly could. Bridget remembers him frequently and with great love, and through her memories, we are exposed to tender glimpses of their life together as they raised their two children. It's a well known fact that romances in stories often lose their tension once the lovers finally get together. By killing Darcy off while he and Bridget were happy and deeply in love, Fielding has avoided this dilemma. 
 2. All fans of Bridget Jones will know of her humorous and relatable struggles with her weight. In Mad About the Boy, Fielding revisits the issue, but the whole thing seems rather old hat and uninspired. For one thing, it's a little depressing to find that at 51, Bridget is still obsessing over her weight in the same way she was 15 years before. What seemed funny when she was young and single now seems rather sad. Secondly, Fielding has Bridget lose 40 lbs more or less effortlessly over the course of a few months. This scenario, rather than being encouraging, minimizes the difficulties of dieting, and serves to make Bridget less relatable to readers. 
 And this weight-loss issue represents a larger problem in this third Bridget Jones novel. As a reader, I found that Bridget's story, which delighted me when I read it for the first time 15 years ago, now felt superficial and irrelevant. Despite the happy ending in the novel, it left me with a sense of sadness. I think perhaps what has happened is that, in the last 15 years, I, and many of Bridget's original fans, have grown up. Unfortunately, despite her fictional troubles, Bridget has not. Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, is a light, rather formulaic romp. It delivers quite a few laughs, but not a lot of insight. Read it just for fun, and you will not be disappointed.""",2013-09-19 09:36:19,"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy (Bridget Jones, #3)",fiction;romance,Helen Fielding
1253,14064,3,"""Ok, but like...if you're going to change the story THAT MUCH, why even bother making a film version? 
 Loved the premise, loved the story, loved the ending, very much did not love the dry writing. It actually started to feel a bit like Walden at one point, with the endless discriptions of him doing boring things. The monotony was broken up by brief interludes of CRAZY INTENSITY and then we'd be back to watching Neville cut up garlic. Again. Or obsess over his situation and then drink himself into oblivion. Yet Again. Which, obviously, you're the last guy on earth, what else is there to do but stock up your provisions, reinforce your protections, and drink until you pass out? But still, not very interesting to read repeatedly. Boredom wasn't what I was expecting from a vampire apocalypse novel, especially one this short. 
 Also, there were some things that were never actually made clear to me. 
 How did Neville know which ones were alive and which were actually dead? And which were the ""real"" vampires? Were they somehow different from the dead ones? He clearly saw some distinction between the groups, but I never figured it out. Did he only realize which were which after he'd killed them? In which case, how was he to be blamed for his actions? And if they need blood to survive, whether alive or dead, how were ANY of them able to survive without a food source? I suppose the dead ones could eat the live ones, but that couldn't last very long before we were back to the same problem. How could there be any sort of live ones left to even create a society? 
 As far as the ""society""...how the hell did that even happen? Who made their pills? Neville talks about seeing the end come and the last living people die etc, so what? Some scientist survived long enough to make pills to cure people and never told anyone about it? He then waited for everyone to die, found a bunch of vampires, ""cured"" them, started a society, and Neville never happened across them? Or maybe one of the vampires just pulled himself out of his mindless zombie-like state and...created a damn antidote? IT MAKES ZERO SENSE. I get that it needed to happen to be able to pull off the ending (which was impactful and wonderful and amazing), but why even bother trying to explain it at all? Couldn't Matheson have decided that they just...got better? Why did a pill have to be involved at all? Couldn't the virus have just mutated enough to be able to let them live their quasi-vampiric existence on its own? They still would have hunted down Neville (for hunting them), the ending would have retained it's impact, and it would have made dramatically more sense. Even that requires a significant suspension of disbelief, but I've been reading SF/Fantasy my entire life and I'm pretty willing to go with you so long as your explanation holds up to even a cursory glance. What are we left with here? ~Magic? 
 (Also, if any of them were plausibly alive and able to rise above his situation to find a cure and thrive, it would have been Ben Cortman. Except...oh right. HE WAS DEAD, and the society made a clear distinction between the dead and themselves, putting all the ""poor wretches"" down kind of brutally. So Ben was dead, but could still think/talk/plan/etc, but the ""live"" people were essentially reduced to blood-thirsty zombies with no thought except their next meal, but one of them somehow not only overcame that but also found a lab, created a pill, tested it, cured humanity, created a society...oh. Well ok then. Gotcha. WHATEVER.) 
 On the subject of the pills... We've established: Robert Neville, last man alive. Got it. So if we make the (considerable) leap that the quasi-living infected have somehow escaped the starving, blood-thirsty dead, ninja-ed themselves some pills partially made from blood to lessen the symptoms, and created a colony of weirdly partially dead sort of humans, it begs the question: where the hell did the blood for the pills come from? Obviously not from the dead or Neville. So the only option is...each other? How is their infected blood going to satiate their hunger or whatever the pills are supposed to do? Even cleansed somehow (which, just, ugh), it doesn't really explain it. 
 Also, I'm just saying, it took me roughly 60 pages to figure out that Kathy was his daughter, not his wife, since she was mentioned several times before Virginia was and was never given any other context aside from ""my Kathy."" I get that HE knows his backstory and why would he have to explain it to himself blah blah but you still have to make things clear for your audience. I know that leaving the audience in the dark is also part of the appeal of this kind of story, but would a little distinction be that much to ask for? ""Somewhere down there was Kathy, his daughter."" There, I fixed it for you.  
 I realize that these are kind of nit-picky and I can feel people rolling their eyes like ""just enjoy the story!"" but it's really bizarre to me that Matheson put so much effort into making the science behind the disease seem plausible (and incredibly detailed) but then be like ""whatev, it doesn't matter, I'll just wave my magic wand..."" about the little things that are important in the long run to the story actually making sense. The more I think about it, the more it bothers me. 
 All that aside, I actually did really like the story and the ending, urgh, the ending. 5 stars for story...less for execution.""",2012-10-16 09:48:08,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson

 Dante Walker. He is really something else. Usually I have a problem with cocky and egotistical characters. They just rub me the wrong way. But if you are so over-the-top in arrogance that it borders on ridiculousness, and then completely own it, I'll find it endearing. 
 Lucky for me, Dante's self-importance rivals Charlie Sheen's. And if you've watched any of Charlie's interviews, you'd know that'd be a damn hard feat to achieve. 
 But here's Dante's perception of himself: 
 That's a lie. I've never been average. I look like a movie star and move like an athlete. 
 Enjoyment of this book will entirely dependent to the ability to appreciate Dante's douchiness. Basically if you hate him, The Collector will make you want to bleach your brain. But I loved it. He was a conceited asshole and I couldn't get enough of him. 
 Girl, I got swag for days. 
 I loved the dialogue in this book. I have to commend Victoria Scott for her use of slang. Her teenager speak was so spot on, I almost wonder if she is one. 
 You don't know who you're fucking with, princess. Ain't no one do bad like I do. 
 Dante's a soul collector with an unlimited AMEX and looks that could melt ice. His life is basically perfect. But then... a girl. Of course it's a girl. It's always a girl. He was sent by the Devil to corrupt her. Not only is she incorruptible, she sees something in him he thought died a long time ago. 
 Because I see you. Even though you try so hard to hide, I see you, anyway 
 If there was one complaint in this book, it'd be Dante's treatment of Charlie in the first half. She wasn't attractive and basically repulsed him. When he did start to warm to her, it was more out of pity than anything. It was almost like they were siblings. So when he did start to like her, I got a bit confused. 
 But alas it didn't bother me that much. So did the cliched Heaven vs Hell storyline bother me? Nope. What about the fact that they fell in love after all of 8 days? Nada. 
 Like I said, this book should have been terribad.

 Dante's voice was pretty awesome. He sorted sounded like swoozie/Adande. It was very fun to read. The narration alone gets it two stars. 
 I really loved how it was in the male point of view. There should be more books like that. 
 The plot seemed a bit too simple, but it was still enjoyable.

1256,29780253,5,"""I never sit down and watch The Daily Show, but over the years I have seen quite a lot from people just sharing the videos. Since Trevor Noah took over, very few clips have made their way to me, so I wonder how well the switch from Jon Stewart is going. I imagine it'll take some time for him to find his stride on there, and I do hope he's given the chance, because, from watching his stand-up and reading this book, it's clear he's the type of person that needs to be on American television right now. 
 Trevor Noah was born in South Africa during the apartheid. His father is a white Swiss man and his mother a black Xhosa woman, which is where the title comes in. It was illegal to have a child of mixed-race at the time, and the stories of him growing up with parents who were not allowed to be seen with him in public are heartbreaking, but he also manages to make them hilarious. This whole book is a testament to finding the humour in dire situations. 
 If you're Native American and you pray to the wolves, you're a savage. If you're African and you pray to your ancestors, you're a primitive. But when white people pray to a guy who turns water into wine, well, that's just common sense. 
 One thing I really found interesting was how racial lines were handled during that time. There were, of course, black people and white people. Those of mixed race are classified as coloured in South Africa, which isn't the derogatory term that it is in North America. There are obviously racist attitudes towards those people, but the term itself apparently isn't treated as a slur. But just to drive home how ridiculous the classifications get, for convenience sake everyone was placed into one of these three categories. So Japanese people were labelled as white and Chinese as coloured, for example, and people could apply with the government to have their classification changed depending on their skin shade and economic standing. It really was idiotic, and I believe a lot of those attitudes still exist to a certain extent in the country. 
 This is his story of growing up poor in a country that didn't think he should exist. His father couldn't be seen with him, and his mother had to pretend he wasn't her son or risk him being taken away. He grew up with a violent and unpredictable drunk of a step-father and had a lot to struggle through, but he also grew up with an incredibly strong mother who clearly had a huge influence on him. It's not just his story that's interesting; it's his outlook and the lessons he learned from his family and his life experiences. This isn't a comedy book, it deals with some very dark subject matter, but it's written by someone who can't help but be funny. 
 I would highly recommend the audio book. Trevor Noah is a natural storyteller, his narration of this book is brilliant, and you also get the added bonus of listening to him speak phrases in Xhosa. That's the language with the clicks that you may have occasionally seen Robin Williams mimic, but it really is beautiful and mesmerizing to hear. 
 Nelson Mandela once said, 'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.' He was so right. When you make the effort to speak someone else's language, even if it's just basic phrases here and there, you are saying to them, 'I understand that you have a culture and identity that exists beyond me. I see you as a human being. 
 Loved every minute of this. If you enjoy memoirs, I don't think you can go wrong with Born a Crime.

 Great Exploitations is something unlike I've read before, but it stuck a chord with me.

1258,15797848,3,"""Somewhere between 2.5 and 3. Disappointing in so many ways. I had high expectations for this one, I've loved all of Stephanie Perkins other books, and I was so excited for what she'd do in the horror genre, but it turns out she doesn't do much. For one thing, this felt more like a contemporary with some murder than a horror novel, since more of the book was spent on Makani and Ollie's relationship than any of the murders, or anything else for that matter. Plus, all of the victims kept being people who had barely been in the book, so there was no emotional investment. The lack of emotional investment continued with the reveal of the killer, which actually happened surprisingly early and was a poor choice, in my opinion, although the worst part had to be that pathetic motive which actually gets no explanation at all. More annoying than any of that were the heavy handed mentions of Makani's Secret Past which was a huge boring letdown when finally revealed. The description on goodreads compared this book to Scream but that couldn't be farther from the case, Scream worked because it was innovative and made you care about the characters and this didn't do any of that. Some of the victims were so stupid I wanted to cheer when they were murdered, such as the girl who noticed things rearranged and freshly opened food in her basement and basically just shrugged despite there being a serial killer on the loose.

1259,19398490,4,"""Beautifully written. Though the novel opens in 1944, the two main characters are both just children at the start of World War II. One, Marie-Laure, is a blind French girl whose father is entrusted with hiding a rare diamond from the Nazis, and the other, Werner, is an orphaned German boy whose knack for fixing radios leads him into a premier school for future soldiers. In 1944 the Americans attack the town where Marie-Laure lives and Werner has been sent to find an French resistance radio operator. Throughout the novel there are lengthy segments that backtrack through the previous decade to show how both Marie-Laure and Werner wound up in the same town. The non-linear storyline promises the reader that eventually the two will meet as does the revelation that a Nazi officer is closing in on Marie-Laure in his search for the diamond. The suspense of her danger from both the bombing and the officer is heightened by the fact that Werner (who's obviously somehow meant to help Marie-Laure) is trapped in the basement of a bombed hotel. 
 For a literary novel, this is a quick read, mostly due to the suspense. Both characters are well-developed by the delving into how they got to Saint-Malo, and easy to empathize with. After the climax, things fell apart a little for me as a reader because the ending I was hoping for did not materialize. Instead, the stark reality of war intervenes in a way that is haunting. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get past that enough as the thread of the narrative is forced to sweep up the loose ends that remain and even the part of the resolution that is ""happy"" seemed blighted to me. So, if you don't mind having your heart broken or plot events that are just hard to accept emotionally, but enjoy themes of redemption, this is definitely a beautiful story I'd highly recommend. 4.5 stars""",2017-01-24 19:05:31,All the Light We Cannot See,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;young-adult,Anthony Doerr

1264,8262550,5,"""See? This is exactly why I read. Because once in a while, in some of my lucky days, I find something like this. An unknown romance, by an unknown author, with a lousy cover and even a lousier title, which nevertheless proves itself to be one of the best of the genre. For me, this book was what I usually call an impact. It is so good, on so many levels, I just don't know where to start praising it. 
 So, I will start with the obvious, the plot. This is the heartfelt story of two lonely broken people, who find each other in the darkness, a story about love, faith, trust and forgiveness, in an era full of prejudice, bigotry and hate, and it is the absolute definition of unputdownable. I spent my entire weekend in my pyjamas, in my bed, with my book, when I had like a ton of other options. You see, this is a romance, and everybody knows what happens in the end of a romance, it's a given. Yet, I was persistently afraid I wasn't going to have my HEA after all, and if this kind of unpredictability doesn't make a good romance novel, I don't know what will. 
 And we have the characters. Being a romance reader, I've been through all the alpha males out there. And between all the billionaires, CEOs, vampires, highlanders, dukes, knights, underground fighters, I've got stick with this undying passion for cowboys (though special ops guys are kinda hot too:D). The male lead in this western romance, Cord Bennett, half-breed and outcast, dark, quiet and handsome, is the absolute melting-ovaries humping-his-leg-on-a-daily-basis kind of cowboy, full of inner strenght, with a kind heart, and who has nothing to prove (he doesn't even pick the fights and the races he's winning, he just doesn't back down from them). 
 And because such a character needed a quality woman, we have Anne Wells Bennett, the best of the best of the best romance lead female characters. Quality and strength attract quality and strength, and so Anne is a powerful little bad-tempered woman, who, though brought up like a lady and sometimes frail, is not the frivolous prejudice type, she is determined, full of grit and really knows how to stand for what she believes in. I want to be her when I grow up. 
 ... beauty doesn't mean much in a woman. It disappears with age. But he said some women have something better. They have a special glow that lasts all their life and just gets richer. You're like that. You really shine.

 ...he wondered if maybe just occasionally the gods designed a woman fit for a king or a prince and then gave her to an ordinary man. Maybe they did such a thing once in a while, knowing an ordinary man would treasure her more, love her better. Maybe they even let him keep her - for a while. 
 I was instantly on her characters' side, and I experienced a lot of emotions while reading their love story. I went from angry to happy, from appalled to reluctant, from shocked to relieved. I haven't heard of the author before, but now I am really getting into her work, she seems to be really gifted. I truly hope she is a bestselling author, and at least half as rich as some romance authors Whom Shall Not Be Named. If not, FML.

I don't have to like all of them, but if I want to punch the main (and only) character in the book every time he says something, it doesn't matter how good the book is otherwise. I get that he is an unreliable narrator and his story of his past has questionable accuracy and a lot of the fun comes from trying to piece together the clues in the story and the book is a dissection of storytelling, but I found the story itself so bland. 
 I found Kvothe the flashback character to be extremely unsympathetic, good at literally everything he tried except dealing with people. His one flaw is that he's not very likable,and he's 100% of the story. So he's supposed to kill a king and do a whole bunch of cool stuff along the way only to fail tragically in the distant future. I couldn't find a reason to care to find out. 
 It quickly became apparent that no matter what predicament his bad luck and lack of social skill got him into, I knew he would reveal a new skill already mastered to get him out of the situation and in better shape than he was before. His skills did not feel earned, and his triumphs felt cheap. I don't care if the story he tells isn't real; the story he told did not engage me. There was no tension except for my frustration with his character. 
 I also didn't like the tone of his narration. The offhand way he described details of the world, histories and magic and herbs, reminded me of a smug ""expert"" who gets off on pointing out to less educated people that he knows more than them.

 Talk about wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am! 
 The book talks about the ""Eves"" - they are the ones that happily married women hope to never meet and unhappy ones contact to rid them of their unhappiness (and to get their major payday). 
 This book makes me think of the moral compass these women have in order to make a living, it has got to be conflicting for them - helping the women get their share from the divorce but destroying a marriage using their bodies - kinda like prostitution, right? 
 Being married, this story struck a cord within me, would I be willing to hire someone to sleep with my husband just so I can get more money out of the separation? If my husband was a cheating scumbag then I'd do it in a heartbeat, but he's not, so I don't have to think about this. Lol.

It'll appeal to both boys and girls, but it was written in such a way that I think Middle Graders will be the ones that love it the most. It's very exciting, with non-stop action as two kids get in over their heads trying to solve the mystery of who is watching Logan and why. The adults don't believe Logan really is being watched, but the kids have a good reason to believe some of the Markless have targeted Logan to kill him. In the process of investigating, the kids get in trouble with their parents and the government.

 The first twelve pages were written in a very distant fashion, and I couldn't tell when we were in a flashback or not. However, after that the writing settled down and got progressively better. I began thinking that the 14-year-old girl I mentor might really enjoy this story. By the end, everything was coming together, and not only was I was enjoying it but I was looking forward to reading the next book. 
 The setting was vividly described, though the technology seemed a bit far-fetched. For example, despite of all the natural disasters, houses were built in tall columns on narrow bases.

And why build on the fertile ground, anyway, if you could build sensible housing on the infertile ground and quickly travel in to the fertile ground to farm?

 This one is about Blythe. Her and her brother lost their parents in a tragic accident, she's completely closed herself off to feelings - all of them - and as such, is a depressed mess. Early one morning while grabbing coffee meets Sabin - who is quirky, outgoing, and appears to be a bit manic. Feeling energized by the encounter, she takes a walk and while sitting on the shore of a lake, see's a guy skipping stones. She's drawn to him and they start a conversation. For the first time in forever, she allows herself to feel. While talking to Chris, she blurts out that her parents are dead, and then is completely mortified that she just told a stranger her secrets. Rather than doing what most do and give her false sympathy, he tells her ""It's okay. Just breathe."" 
 She finds that Chris and Sabin are brothers, and they are all studying at the same college along with their other twin siblings Estelle and Eric. The five form a bond of sorts - some more emotional than others. They're all without parents, and while it seems a bit unrealistic at times, the author somehow makes it work if you just go with it.

Yeah, not for me. 
 Now, I know we NEED all different types of romance because there are all different types of people. There are people who hate the stuff I like. Equally, there are people who hate the stuff I write. That is OK. We're a melting pot here. That's what is so great about the diversity of the United States. It is OK for us to like different things. When you find something you like, share it.

Did I mention the HAWT sex? Yeah, lots of it. Great sex. D battery sex. Not AA sex--at all. 
 Sometimes, I'm not sure what's going on, but I have full faith Ms Hutchins will catch me up to speed when it's time. And she does. 
 Synthia is great. The juxtaposition of some of the scenes and her snarky comments are so fae fucking clever and humorous. I want her to be my new BFF. Really, mo fo's are in historic garb and she is given a janky yet enchanted dagger to which she responds ""What the hell is this supposed to do? Pick his teeth after he eats my bones."" In another scene, also very royal and prestigious, two ladies are about to throw down (two royal ladies dressed all kinds of fancy) and what does Synthia have to say? ""Well shit, this was going to be entertaining."" Again, I did my ugly laugh, something Synthia made me do a lot. thankfully I was alone. She is so normal amidst all the weird shit happening around her. I think I have a huge crush on Ryder and a little one on Synthia too... 
 I need to go to bed, but instead I am going to read a little of book 3. Very very sad to find out this isn't a trilogy and I have to wait for more books. Happy nonetheless that I get to stay in Synthia's world a little bit longer though. Her world is fucked up, but gripping/stunning/witty/haunting/erotic/passionate. Yes, passionate. This book is filled with passion. Not just sexy passion, but passion for family, friends, your home, your loved ones who have passed, your people, your land... just everything. Those are my parting words. This book is bursting with passion.""",2014-04-14 15:06:30,"Taunting Destiny (The Fae Chronicles, #2)",fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Amelia Hutchins
1278,17325147,5,"""I don't like to retell the book in my review. I want to express how the book made me feel without giving spoilers. As with some other books I've read, it would be impossible for me to attempt to give a brief overview of this book as there as so much to it. The story takes place over an extended period of time so you, as the reader, are able to truly go on a journey with these characters. All 7 of them. I was frustrated various times. I cried, not sobbing, this is so sad, In the Stillness tears. I cried because even during the so called ""sad"" parts, I was moved. The strength of the characters that shines, even in their weakest moments, made me stop and take stock of my own life. There are some that have/had it better than me and some that had/have it worse. Its all relative though. We as humans are truly resilient beings, but we usually can't do it alone. We seek connection, belonging, and interaction with others. We need each other. This book really made me realize how much my few friends mean to me and how devoted I am to them. Despite the many miles between us, a friend is someone who will hold your hand from across the miles while you travel through a shit storm. They are the ones that help you clean off the shit after you've come through it. Then they will laugh with you at the horrid stench of the shit. The characters' devotion to each other makes me want to call my handful of BFFs and pledge my love to them!! That the author was able to create these characters in such a way that I felt their devotion to one another is impressive. As well, the hints she drops along the way that don't tie up until the last 10% kept me on edge. I loved that. Whew, this was an intense book.

1279,16076395,4,"""Received a digital copy from the author for an honest review 
 You open the book and the first thing you see is this: 
 ""And for our children. Because one day, I want you to know the whole story of how I met your 
 father."" 
 Right there and then made me curious of who the father could be and how they met. 
 That was one part that intrigued me the most and the second, what the story is all about of course, that this book is the memoir of the author's two month road trip across the country all by herself, and don't forget Canada. 
 This is the story of Angeli an 18 year old girl who decides to take a two month road trip the summer after her high school graduation, to visit her internet friends all over U.S and Canada. 
 Her courage to take on a trip like that all by herself is admirable and I wish I had the guts to do something like that. 
 It must be amazing to meet your internet friends in real life to see if their exactly like you thought they would be or different, in a good or bad may. 
 ""She felt closer to some of her 
 online peers than she did to the friends she saw on a daily basis."" I understand that completely, I feel exactly the same way with my internet friends. 
 I was intrigued to get to know who the father of her children turned out to be. With that in mind I had these thoughts in my head every time Angeli visited someone: 
 ""could that be him, or maybe this guy?"" or ""nah, not him and I wish it was him"". 
 If I got disappointed of who it turned out to be, you are wrong. I was more than happy with who it turned out to be, he seems like the sweetest guy. Always asking how Angeli was feeling and so caring. 
 One of my favorite parts is when Angeli got lost one night on her way to meet her new host and it turned out she made the wrong turn and he was looking for her. That was really sweet of him and that hug! If only I could meet someone from the internet and say 
 ""it's so weird... you're a real person"". 
 I liked it from start to finish. It was well written and you never got bored besides the parts were she visited someone for a short time and you could feel that she did not enjoy her visit. Angeli felt very mature of her age and very wise and made good decisions. But which teenager isn't confused and not sure of what you want to do with your life. Rather than to hurt someone from getting their heart broken or mislead them in any way she decided to let them down nicely. I respected her for that. But in the end even Angeli couldn't even hold back. I guess when you find the right one, you know. Made me glad that she found someone she didn't want to let go off even if she tried. 
 There were some up and downs, good and bad, fun and sad, cute and bold moments. Everyone who's read it or going to is going to want to make a road trip after reading this book, i'll promise you that because I certainly do! 
 And it gives you hope that it's someone out there for everyone.

The conclusion I eventually came to while reading is that this book just didn't go there. Now, normally that phrase means a book didn't do something dark, but I mean it didn't go there in terms of emotions. I felt a distance that I shouldn't have. 
 It also wasn't always convincing about what it was telling me. I kept flipping back to see if I'd missed when it told me about Hildy wanting to be/should've been an actress. I didn't get that at all. I also didn't get that Laura was an actress because of Hildy. Not at all. And I thought Laura should've figured out Hildy was pregnant. Not as a kid, but once she reached adulthood, it should've crossed her mind, especially with Josephine's big ""you didn't know everything"" hint. Also, I don't get why Josephine didn't TELL Laura way sooner than she did.  
 And, um, I was never clear on how famous Laura was really supposed to be. It seemed like she was really only famous for a short period of time and then didn't really act anymore. At least, that was the impression I got, but I was never even clear about THAT. (And I'm not sure why she didn't act.) 
 Okay, this isn't the book's fault, but the description of this book and the press I heard sold it to me all wrong. It's not about an actress and how acting might've ruined her life and family. It's just about a woman living her life. It's also not dark, which is the impression I got. (A good thing, in my opinion!) And I liked the depiction of her children. 
 But I LIKED it. It was a pleasure to read. But I want to pick it apart, too.""",2012-07-08 14:23:25,Laura Lamont's Life in Pictures,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Emma Straub

But the first volume managed to win me over by exploring the murky morals of using a humanoid robot for any number of uses. The story starts slowly by examining Alex's depressing, monotonous life, but things pick up when he's gifted an android. Unfortunately the android's presence only enhances Alex's level of depression because she has no opinions, feelings, or interests. She doesn't even eat unless Alex tells her to. The whole situation is beyond creepy and Alex starts searching around for some remedy. His search leads him to some secretive people and he ends up in strange places doing things he never thought he'd do. I don't want to say much more for fear of giving the whole story away. 
 If you like graphic novels and haven't read this one, you should definitely give it a try. The story and characters get more complex and interesting as the plot thickens. Somebody might not be drawn to this specifically because of the artwork, but it's pretty great as a vessel to tell the story.

1290,29780253,5,"""I must admit that I know embarrassingly little on the subject of apartheid. I was fairly young when Nelson Mandela was freed and I was so far removed from that side of the world that it meant little to me. It wasn't until I read J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace that I took it upon myself to learn something about South Africa and its turbulent history. I still feel woefully unequipped to comprehend, let alone discuss, the ramifications of apartheid, so it was with open, knowledge-hungry arms that I grabbed Born a Crime, Trevor Noah's memoir of growing up as a half-black, half-white citizen in South Africa during and after apartheid. 
 The title is literal: during apartheid, it was illegal for a black person to have sexual relations with a white person. As such, Noah was treated differently than the other children he grew up around. He was kept indoors, so that others wouldn't see a light-skinned child running about. When he went for walks with his mother, she walked behind him and a colored neighbor whose skin more closely resembled his. His grandmother wouldn't punish him like the others because his skin showed bruises, and his grandfather called him ""Mastah,"" though Noah didn't know what that meant at the age of five. 
 What is so interesting to me, as a fellow half-black person, is how different the mixing of races can be perceived depending on location and political environment. While I've certainly had to answer my fair share of ""What are you?"" questions, I've never felt the intense divide that plagues Noah throughout his life. I've had the luxury of refusing to choose a side, but Noah did not - at times it was literally a matter of life and death for him. Yet, owing to his dual ethnicity, he is privy to the machinations of a society that works to oppress those with darker skin. He can see how arbitrary these ethnic classifications are and how striving for whiteness only furthers animosity between these groups. I was gobsmacked by the idea that individuals could promoted to white: ""Your hair might become straight enough, your skin might become light enough, your accent might become polished enough - and you'd be reclassified as white. All you had to do was denounce your people, denounce your history, and leave your darker-skinned friends and family behind."" Although I am familiar with ""passing"" (that is, being light-skinned enough to pass for white), I am not aware of any such promotional system ever existing in the US. But in a way this still hits a bit of truth for me, for this is the plight of many mixed race people - society forces you to choose a side and deny a part of who you are. 
 For all of the brilliant edification Noah gives us on living in and after apartheid, rest assured that he also includes a fair bit of self-deprecating humor in these pages. His pawn-shop hustle is impressive, though ultimately self-defeating, and I've rarely felt so embarrassed for a person as I did when he talks of a major social blunder during his days as a DJ doing dance battles (I won't spoil it, but it's a good one). But even within the humor, Noah manages to excavate a lesson in humanity in every story. He is admittedly not smooth with the ladies in high school, and even though he managed to get the most beautiful girl he and his friends had ever seen to go to prom with him, he couldn't convince her to get out of the car because he never bothered to find out that they didn't speak the same language. It's a fitting metaphor for the environment in which he grew up. 
 This is a story about politics and social strife, but ultimately it is one about family. For all his bad behavior as a child, Noah is always in awe of his mother's strength, and never more so than when he talks about the period of their lives where they suffered at the hands of his abusive stepfather. The story he tells will chill you, and though it should not be surprising that a society still living in segregation would also work to subjugate its women, I could not help but be appalled by the events he chronicles. And then I was saddened, because I know that this continues to go on today and I know this is happening here, just as much as it is happening there, and we are still so far from finding a way to fix it. Noah isn't so bold as to suggest a cure for the patriarchy any more than he is to suggest a cure for systemic racial oppression, but in talking about his mother's abuse so openly, so plainly, he gives voice to those who cannot be heard. He is doing for others what his mother did for him: 
 My mom raised raised me as if there were no limitations on where I could go or what I could do. When I look back I realize she raised me like a white kid--not white culturally, but in the sense of believing that the world was my oyster, that I should speak up for myself, that my ideas and thoughts and decisions mattered... the highest rung of what's possible is far beyond the world you can see. My mother showed me what was possible. The thing that always amazed me about her life was that no one showed her. No one chose her. She did it on her own. She found her way through sheer force of will. 
 Many of you already know Noah from his assumption to The Daily Show's throne and you may have already formed certain opinions of him. I encourage you put aside whatever feelings you have about his work to read this informative, heartbreaking, and inspiring book. 
 (Note: I was able to snag a free copy of the audio during an Audible promotion and listened to it while reading along. I highly recommend it, as Noah's voice adds to so much his own story. It was also great to hear his pronunciation of names and words I wouldn't even begin to know how to say.)

Unfortunately, when there's only one human left alive, you're kind of stuck with him, and I learned that I would not want Robert Neville as my only companion in the smoking ruins of the world.

I haven't seen ""The Omega Man"", which is based on this novella, but I had no trouble picturing Charlton Heston grinding his jaw through the role. The I Am Legend drinking game would require a drink taken for every one Neville drinks, two drinks for every drink he throws against a wall, three for each time he slams his fist into a wall or onto a table, and you get to slap yourself back to sobriety each time he slaps a woman across the face. Yep, Neville has two encounters with women in the narrative's present time, and he slaps them both across the face. It takes an awful lot for me to get my feminist panties in a twitch, but Robert Neville accomplished that pretty quickly.

1294,12985143,0,"""My Review 
 For some time now, I've held off on reading werewolf novels, but within a few chapters of Hemlock, the debut from Kathleen Peacock, I knew not only that I couldn't hold out any longer, but also that this novel was truly something astoundingly special. Poignant, electrifying, and enchanting, Hemlock is a spectacular start for Peacock. Picking up shortly after Mackenzie's best friend is murdered by a werewolf, Hemlock races headlong into the action as a still-grieving Mac decides to take matters into her own hands and investigate Amy's death. Along for the thrill-ride are a wonderfully written cast of supporting characters, ranging from the tragically broken Jason (Amy's boyfriend), the protective Kyle (Mac's best friend), and Tess (Mac's cousin and parental figure.) Between the stunning cast of characters, their intricate relationships, and the mystery aspect, I absolutely couldn't put down Hemlock or tear myself loose from the gorgeous web the story wove around me. 
 Mac is a refreshing protagonist - self-aware without being TOO much so, spirited, honest, and brave. She's also a tremendously strong female, with a huge heart. Mac cares a great deal about her friends and family, and isn't afraid to show it in various ways, whether it's reaching out to try to save Jason, who's fallen apart after Amy's death, or looking out for Tess. I want to applaud Kathleen Peacock for writing such an amazingly sympathetic and likable character in Mackenzie. This story, compelling as it was, wouldn't have made such a huge impact on me where it not for Mac. 
 Hemlock did make an impression on me, from start to finish. I enjoyed trying to figure out who Amy's killer was, and it was delightfully frustrating in so many ways. Kathleen Peacock has written a nicely-developed mystery that stumped me and will likely continue to do so with readers. When the mystery finally was solved, I think I may have gasped. Between that aspect, and the Trackers, an above-the-law fanatical group of werewolf hunters, Hemlock definitely had a darker feel than I expected, but one that I adored. I definitely want to know more about the Trackers, and about the werewolf camps, as well as about the secondary group that came into play during the story, battling for rights for werewolves. 
 I didn't want to finish Kathleen Peacock's debut novel for many reasons, yet another one being how haunting and brilliant all the characters and their interactions were. I felt for so many of them, and yet I have to say, I think - and this may seem odd - that one of the strongest characters in the novel was Amy. Although she was never anything but a memory, she was very much a presence: in Mac's nightmares, in between Mac and Jason, and Mac and Kyle, in the town, in the mystery of her death. Amy was compelling, and added yet another layer, another enigma to Hemlock, because as the story goes on, we see that there was much more to Amy than anyone knew. I also really loved Mackenzie's relationship with Tess. Despite Mac's family history, it was clear how much she and Tess cared for one another. 
 Further complicating Hemlock in an elegantly heart-pounding manner is the thread of romance Kathleen has woven throughout her novel. I didn't expect to fall in love with any characters, but I fell, hard, for Kyle. It's been a few weeks now since I finished Hemlock and I'm still swooning over him. I really enjoyed watching Mac and Kyle puzzle through their feelings for one another, and I thought their relationship was intense, sweet, and perfect, in some ways. I could see how badly Mac wanted to rescue and fix Jason, but I think by the time Hemlock ended both she and he were starting to realize he would have to save himself for it to mean anything. I was slightly disappointed in the emerging love triangle between Kyle, Mackenzie, and Jason, but I will say it was all well-written, emotional, and an impossible decision for Mac to make. I'm glad Peacock didn't rush her toward either boy rather, the steps Mac did take felt natural and organic. I am definitely a Kyle/Mac girl, but I cannot wait to see where the second book takes all of these characters I've come to love. 
 Yes, I said love. It may seem improbable, but I already feel like I know these characters, this town. Hemlock was such a bewitching and compelling debut that I know I won't forget it anytime soon. Some books just have IT, that spark, that combination of events, characters, writing, and themes as to make them unforgettable. There's a certain kind of magic in a well-written, striking book, where all the ingredients meshed perfectly. And with plenty of action, mystery, romance, darkness, heart, and soul, Hemlock is one of those books.""",2011-10-26 10:46:19,"Hemlock (Hemlock, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Kathleen Peacock
1295,59980,5,"""Frank Miller's follow-up to his seminal graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns has a special place in my heart, as it was the first Batman comic I've ever read, as around the same time I also bought The Killing Joke, after watching (and many times since its release) Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. 
 Influenced the first of Nolan's trilogy: Batman Begins, Year One follows the first year of Bruce Wayne's return to Gotham City as the caped crusader to fight the criminals, as well as Lt. James Gordon's first year in law enforcement in a city ruled by the corrupt. As Batman and the only good cop are initially against one another, during the progression of the story, the two realize they can't fight this war on their own. 
 While TDKR is so jam-packed with so memorable moments from an aging Batman fighting the Mutant gag, his unhealthy reunion with the Joker and the climatic battle between the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel; Year One takes a more subtle and grounded approach to the first year of Batman and Gordon's uneasy alliance. As there are no outlandish villains, there are just the mobsters and the dirty cops, while the realistic characterisation of the two protagonists is the heart of the story, with their traditional Frank Miller-written inner monologues gets you inside the heads of these lone heroes. 
 Whilst Miller's art in TDKR looks rough but still great in today's standards, David Mazzucchelli's work on Year One is stunning as ever, as he presents the grim-looking Gotham City, as shown best shown in Bruce Wayne's surveillance mission to the seedy East End, where he fights a violent pimp and a bunch of prostitutes including the teenager Holly Robinson and the dominatrix-turned-Catwoman Selina Kyle. When it comes to action, Batman isn't shown as a super-heroic figure who can take out six-hundred, as here he barely survives a fight with a group of thieves and comes out as he says in his inner monologue: a ""lucky amateur"". He's not a superhero, or as initially seen a giant Bat-creature, he is only human. 
 While there have been great stories of the Dark Knight facing such colourful villains from the Joker to Ra's al Ghul, Year One is the best Batman story of all time, which is simply about the birth of a partnership between two men who are about to fight a war that will define them both. On Page 38, a large panel showing a shadowed figure reveals himself from the thick smoke and says to his enemies: ""Ladies. Gentlemen. You have eaten well."" That's when you know the orphaned millionaire becomes a symbol.""",2013-02-24 10:09:11,Batman: Year One,comics;graphic;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;fantasy;paranormal;young-adult,Frank Miller;David Mazzucchelli;Richmond Lewis;Dennis O'Neil

 Four points I have to make in this quick and short review, which kind of refer to the whole trilogy (I hope): 
 1) Probably the only book in which I liked every. Single. Character. 
 You have no IDEA how full of hatred I usually am. Kvothe has something about him that even though I'd like to call him Gary Stu and hate his guts, I just have to love him and cheer for him and bawl like a baby when he mentions his past. Besides - the sexual tension between him and D. is OVER 9000! 
 2) Pat turned out to be one of my favourite human beings in general. 
 3) You're tearing me apart Lisa Rothfuss 
 4) The writing style. Elodin. Sympathy. A (magic, all in all) University, not a freaking high school AT LAST. The songs. The atmosphere. The I can't say more because spoilers. Everything. Is. A. Work. Of. Genius. 
 5) Denna, I love you, you brilliant creature. 
 Summary: Pat is a horrible person and you should avoid this series until it gets its ending or else you'll be depressed for the rest of your life. And feel all the things.""",2013-02-06 08:58:47,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
1299,14975,3,"""This book holds its secrets well. Revelations were far and few between. Then the ending becomes one nonstop discovery. I really liked how the story moved between Alice and Alais' stories. As the pace picked up, so did the transitions. It was a creative sorytelling tool. Though I found the historical part more intriguing. It seemed to let you in on its secret's faster. 
 The first part was mostly about introducing a vast array of characters who also had a historical tie, but it did make it a slightly tedious read at first. One thing that really distracted me was the characters going in and out of French. I don't know French language, buildings, or history. So it really frustrated me when a sentence would suddenly flow into French language. A word here and there... okay! I get it. Gives the story flavor. There was a sparce glossary at the end. Some words I could guess, but then sometimes a character would say a word in French followed by English essentially repeating themselves. Who does that? Especially if the characters speak the same language. So the prose itself was a bit inconsistent and distracting. There would be a paragraph in English, then it would end in a French saying. What was that? 
 The author does have lovely illusions. The plot development was good. I thought it was a good and a twisting adventure. The plot was complex with fresh ideas brewing. The characterization was strong. Its just the culture that wasn't strong enough and put me off a bit as it tried to hard to belch out French sayings to an unfamiliar audience. I got confused by the French words and places (even with the map at the beginning). 
 In summary, I liked it and would read it again. But if you're going to write French characters using Engligh, keep it consistent. It didn't feel genuine when a character would switch in between. Overall a good mystery and good suspense. I think fans of stories like DaVinci Code and Juliet would enjoy this story.""",2012-06-01 13:27:58,"Labyrinth (Languedoc, #1)",fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime;romance,Kate Mosse
1300,14064,4,"""Pleasantly jilted out of my distaste for all things ""vampire"" and reconsidering my blanket discrimination against so-called ""horror"" pulp adapted by Hollywood (I didn't see the movie). Actually, it's not so much that - I'm pretty sure I would still hate a pulpy awfully written horror action-story about vampires destined for the screen, but that's not what I Am Legend is at all. So it would be more accurate to say that what's happened with my first Matheson novel is that I'm now compelled to consider that some books in this genre may impart meaningful messages, and that they're not all stereotyped characters, cliched formulas, mindless action and blood/sex. 
 There are certainly ""vampires"" in this book (people infected with a bacteria), but that's not what I Am Legend is about: rather, it's a simple but profound story of isolation. How would you feel if you woke up one day and you were the only person left on Earth/as far as you could tell? How would the lack of human contact affect your mood, stability, purpose? What would it be like to never talk to another again, to never even hear your own voice? To not be able to share any of your burdens or joys? To wake up in a world of ""others"" (adapted vampires) and to realize, you are now the threat, the abnormality? 
 Matheson doesn't philosophize much (not a complaint, my preference is for ""showing"" over ""telling"" in fiction), and he writes in a clear, direct, and simple voice. He's no literary scholar, but his prose also doesn't reek of the immature use of metaphors and sophomoric language frequently employed by today's ""best-selling"" pulp authors. 
 If you're looking for an action-packed thriller, this isn't it. But if you are open to an introspective foray into some depressing existential questions, you will be pleasantly surprised.""",2016-02-02 16:37:40,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson
1301,77604,4,"""This was my introduction to Rex Stout, and I am hooked! The mystery was weak and a ""1/5"" compared to classic Christie, but still the book was brilliant. First is Stout's use of language, which I do not claim to fully understand - his analogies, humor, and descriptions are full of American 30's slang (most of which I don't get), or are otherwise incredibly witty and creative in a non-traditional sense. Trying to understand Stout fully was like a puzzle; there are few books that take so much effort for me to fully get, and I felt smarter after each sentence (sure, I feel this way after most books, but in a holistic sense, after finishing, not as much *while* I am reading each word, trying to make sense of all the shades and implications of interesting phrases). 
 Second, the book is all about mood - it perfectly situates the reader in this period of American history. Finally, the characters - WOW. I did not even realize how attached to them I was until I finished the book, then tried to pick up something else; I realized I couldn't do it, I had to go back to Wolfe and Archie, so I immediately started on their second adventure.

1302,14069,3,"""Alright! So, in this story, China has discovered that one of its eggs is in the hands of a sailor who, in their opinion is unworthy of their egg, and decide that they want to take Temeraire with them back to China to his own homeland. Of course, Laurence has problems with that and the rest of the story is them going to China and discovering new things about the dragons in China and a little bit of Temeraire's heritage. 
 The first book developed and strengthened the bond of friendship between Temeraire and Laurence. There wasn't a lot of conflict but it was good and that's where the focus of the book was. This book puts a little bit of stress and conflict in the relationship but doesn't do much to make it any more interesting. 
 I mean, yeah . . . Laurence does yell at Temeraire once because of a safety issue and Temeraire is shocked and they both feel guilty about it. There's also this Prince Yongxing who is trying to separate the two but their loyalty to one another is so strong that it doesn't even matter because Laurence will always stay with Temeraire and Temeraire is possessive of Laurence and won't give him up for anything else. But there are issues and problems that Laurence goes through that is completely understandable. He sees the way that dragons are treated in China and he does worry that Temeraire will want to stay because of those reasons but at the same time, he doesn't blame Temeraire because he does admit to himself that China seems like a better environment for dragons. 
 As for the plot, there's not really much to say about it. For the most part they are on a ship with their crew to China with a subplot of Yongxing trying to separate Temeraire and Laurence by introducing Temeraire to the Chinese culture and putting emphasis on almost treating him like a member of royalty. I know that Yongxing is supposed to be hated because he is trying to separate the two, but I never got that. I never hated the guy because I found his motive reasonable. He despises the way that Laurence and the crew treat Temeraire and wants Temeraire to be companions with a member of the royal house in order to get him closer to the throne. His motive is not the most likable, in fact, it's very selfish, but it is understandable. He sees Temeraire being treated like an animal and says he deserves better and I don't hate him for that. He wants power and because he is not the first heir to the throne it makes sense that we would want to use Temeraire for royal claimant to the Emperor's throne. He has different views and lives by different customs that sometimes don't make sense but I just don't see him as a 'villain' or a 'trail that the characters must overcome in order to strengthen their bond'. That doesn't mean I necessarily like him, I just don't hate him. 
 What I also found interesting was that they didn't get to China until chapter 11 (out of 17 chapters) which is odd because I thought that most of the book would be them in China. 
 Now let's move on to the characters. 
 Temeraire and Laurence are still enjoyable and even though they don't change, they're still fun to follow around. Granby, Riley, Roland, Jane, Maximus, Berkley, Lily, and the rest of the crew are still likable except they are not around as much as they were in the first book. Temeraire is still awesome and even though he is intelligent and calm at times, it's still fun to see him whiny and be a bit 'rebellious' at times. One example is when Temeraire is wounded and the doctor said that he couldn't fly for about a month so he could heal. About three weeks of waiting, Temeraire grows impatient and 'grumbles' when he couldn't go for a flight. So what does he do? He jumps off the boat and goes for a swim. He enjoys himself and doesn't show much guilt. I found it hilarious and really entertained when Temeraire does 'rebel' and will go to such great lengths to keep Laurence. When Laurence was about to be arrested, Temeraire just picked him up and took off. 
 Yep, right in front of the guards too. 
 So, I found the book to be really good and was about to rate it a high rating but then I had some issues. One of the biggest issues I had was the lack of characterization of the characters in China. Now don't get me wrong, I don't hate them at all. My only problem is that the characters from China seemed very interesting but they weren't even explored a lot. 
 Most of the characters I wanted to know more about were a few of the dragons. Temeraire's mother, Lung Tien Qian, for example. She is a Celestial dragon that is basically a larger version of him. She's kind and has this air about her that makes her seem more honorable and wise. The only time we see her is when she talks to Laurence about British customs and how her son is honored in their country. She doesn't seem mean or anything and I would've like to know more about her. There's not a whole lot of depth to her; which is a shame because I would like to know more about her personality and how she felt when she allowed one of her eggs to be taken out to sea. 
 There are other characters like Mei, who is a female Imperial dragon that Temeraire begins to court. I would also like to know more about her. She's Temeraire's teacher! She should be interesting if he begins to court her. Why don't they show us more of her? She appears around two times and that's it. 
 Lien is a pure while Celestial who is Yongxing's companion but is seen as a cursed dragon because of her color (according to the Chinese, a pure white dragon is bad luck). I don't know anything about this dragon! She should be interesting and have more depth to her. Let's take a look at her life. Her being pure white has caused everyone to think that she is cursed and is no good. This is what should have been explored. I would have loved to see Lien's struggle to rely on Yongxing and what she's going through. I mean, think about it! She was born and her looks, even though she is a Celestial, which are practically royal dragons, cause her to be constantly feared and despised by the Chinese because she represents 'bad luck'. What a tragedy! How come this isn't getting any deeper? I would love to learn more about this. 
 There are also other characters who get little-to-no view at all. Temeraire's twin brother showed up like ONCE and then we basically never saw him again. Temeraire's father, Lung Qin Gao, is mentioned as being an Imperial but we never see him! I'm not even sure how strong of a relationship Temeraire's parents have! Qian seems to be proud of her mate but there's no depth or anything! I would like to know a little bit more about them and what their opinion was when Temeraire had to be sent away. 
 Another issue I had was the ending. So, Yongxing wanted to use Temeraire as a rival companion in the competing for the throne and so there was an attempt on Laurence's life by a few Chinese bandits. But since that didn't work, Yongxing used a stage performance as a diversion so someone can assassinate Laurence. But he missed and Temeraire found him, killed him and was going to go after Yongxing. But Lien got in the way and they fought. BUT the fighting ending up killing Yongxing and instead of the Emperor saying anything or anybody pointing fingers at the dragons or Laurence, the Emperor adopted Laurence. I'm not kidding. And then Temeraire decided to go back to Britain to improve the treatment towards dragons and then it just ends.  
 Geez, that was fast and didn't sound believable. At all. Hopefully, you can see why I have a few issues with this book. 
 Ok, so after my complaining and moaning does this book hold up to its predecessor? Yes. Yes, it does. I won't spoil or reveal anything but there are things that cause a little bit of strain on Temeraire and Laurence's relationship (which is good because the whole point of the first one was to develop the relationship in the first place) but it only shows from Laurence's perspective. And although I like Laurence, it would be nice to see what Temeraire is thinking. 
 The relationship works well, but it would be nice for them to actually have a fight or some sort of conflict to make them develop and get along if they don't see eye-to-eye.""",2013-05-22 12:40:20,"Throne of Jade (Temeraire, #2)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;young-adult,Naomi Novik

 I really had to force myself to finish this book but that was just because at some point I decided I needed to see how much worse it could get when the big reveal occurred. For some torturous reason I had to know how the story would end. Would he live? Would he die? Would they stay together, regardless of health? 
 Side note: I'll put this in a spoiler tag since it is a non-book related rant only slightly relative to this review. A year or two ago I would not have questioned the fate of the lovers in my romance novel. I probably would have just stopped reading this book when it became clear I was not enjoying it, secure in the knowledge that even though I didn't really care, the couple would in fact go on to fully recover from all illnesses and live happily ever after. But some romance writers have been playing fast and loose with my HEAs so all bets are off in that department. So I blame them *yeah, I'm talking to you Ward* for making me have to actually finish this book just to be sure one or both of the guys didn't kick the bucket.  
 Considering what we know from the book blurb about what's-his-name's health (see, I couldn't even care enough to remember the dying guy's name) I should have known not to get my hopes up that the HEA wouldn't have me rolling my eyes. 
 Maybe I'm being too hard on the writer. Is it even possible to have a scenario like the one listed in the blurb and not have it end in one of two ways: the first being what I like to call the ""Dark Lifetime Movie of the Week"" in which the hero dies and the movie ends with the dead hero's parents sort of adopting the lover he left behind. The man left behind lost his soul mate but it's all good because he now has a family to love him and make up for all the hurts inflicted on him by his real family.  OR the second way it could end, aka ""Rainbows and Unicorns Lifetime Movie of the Week"" in which some unbelievable *cue eye rolling* event occurs and everyone lives happily ever after.  
 If anyone has read a book in which there was a third possible outcome I'd love to hear it. 
 My dislike of the story rates this a 2.0 but I'm adding another point because the writing was, by my definition, good. And by that I mean we saw both of the MCs POVs (which I love) AND the POV shifts were clear. No bouncing POV from one paragraph to the next (which I hate). This is the first book I've read by this author and while the story didn't work for me the writing style did so I would probably consider reading something else by this writer.""",2015-12-19 07:12:24,A Fortunate Blizzard,romance;fiction,L.C.

 Likes: 
 1. The characters, main and secondary, were amazing. Nat and Asher were so complex beneath the surface. The whole cast really meshed well together, like a huge extended family. The things that Ash went through as a child just broke my heart. Nat was fun, strong, sweet, and not afraid to speak her mind. Ash was an alpha-male, but not the overbearing, annoying type. Plus, Nat and Ash were both pretty funny. And most importantly, the characters didn't frustrate me. 
 2. The writing style flowed smoothly. 
 3. The plot was fantastic. There were multiple aspects to the plot, but it didn't seem over crowded. As well, everything was developed nicely. There were conflicts from external forces and internal (within the characters) forces, which made the story more enjoyable and captivating. There was the perfect amount of drama. The problems were real life problems and nothing seemed irrational. There was enough drama and angst to keep me interested without making me want to through my kindle against the wall. 
 4. The romance was not insta-love; it was an enemies to friends, friends to lovers type of romance. It was well developed through simple interactions, deep conversations, and overcoming difficult battles together. 
 5. The amount of steam was perfect. It was hot and there were plenty of scenes, but not enough to make it over kill. I liked that the sex was secondary to the romance and not a defining characteristic of it (e.g. the relationship wasn't based on sex). I also liked how the characters weren't constantly fawning over each other and just wanted to go at it like rabbits every time they were together. 
 6. The book had the perfect amount of humor. 
 Dislikes: 
 1. I wish that there was more. I think that the last part of their story will be featured in the next book (just like Nik and Tina's story was continued in this book). 
 Notes: 
 1. 1st person duel POV 
 2. setting- New York City 
 3. stand alone with an epilogue. 
 4. the ending leaves you in a happy place. it's kind of a mix of HEA and HFN

1311,17980013,3,"""Not quite as good as Fighting Destiny, but still around a 3.0. The story was interesting, but this was one of those books where every man is attracted to the main character because they see her snarkiness as a sign of strength. 
 Plot: 
 Syn and Adam have found out they are Fae, and both are starting to transition. As if that is not enough to worry about, there is still a murderer killing witches and Fae, and Syn has no idea who she can trust. 
 Characters: 
 When we were introduced to Syn, she was snarky, impulsive, and in a state of self-denial when it came to her feelings for Ryder. This time around, we can tell by her inner monologues that she is falling in love with him. Ryder, however, continues to act like the cocky, self-consumed alpha male and denies any emotional connection to Syn. He is also harboring some kind of incredible secret, which we don't have many details about. 
 Alden continues to be there for Syn no matter what. Adam, on the other hand, is quite erratic, especially since he's going through transition. All of the other male characters, including Adrian, have become quite fond of Syn, and as a result, are increasingly protective of her. 
 Writing: 
 There are several misspelled words and missing punctuation marks throughout the book, but nothing is so bad that it really interrupts the story line. There is a LOT of cursing, and because this is a new adult book, there are several adult situations, and most of them are very graphic. I'm not a prude or anything (otherwise, I wouldn't be reading the book), but there are several uses of the P-word, and not just by Ryder; Syn uses the term as well. It's probably hypocritical of me, but I don't really expect that kind of language from girls. It's not really unusual when a guy says it, especially in this book, where the males are pretty demeaning when they refer to their encounters with women. When Syn says it, however, it's kind of a like a record scratch. 
 The Bottom Line: 
 The characters are still one dimensional, and the story still revolves more around sex than actual plot points. However, if you made it this far, you have probably gotten past the caveman mentality, misogynistic sexual attitudes, and crude language and accepted the series as the guilty pleasure it is. While Taunting Destiny was a little slower than its predecessor, it definitely makes up for it in the end with an INCREDIBLE cliffhanger.

I didn't, so I started Iniquity pretty lost, and with all of the portals and time jumps, I'm not sure I really ever got back up to speed. As a result, this book fell somewhere between a 3 and a 3.5 for me. It's really a shame, too. This series had so much potential, but somewhere along the way, things started to go off track. 
 Plot: 
 Evie must unite the angels and fairies and create an army to fight the demons being released from Sheol. 
 Characters: 
 Evie is still annoyingly indecisive. While I'm totally Team Reed, it was Brennus' thoughts that summed up my feelings about Evie perfectly: ""He sighs wearily. 'Ye love him, ye love me, ye love dem--ye love us all.'"" I think it's nice that Evie cares so much for everyone, but isn't it crazy that she's supposed to lead an army, be queen of the faeries, and determine whose soul is worth redeeming when she can't even decide which guy she wants to be with? 
 Once again, Reed was awesome. And once again, it bothers me that Evie professes her love for him but (as usual) although I'm tired of Evie not being emotionally loyal. It also bothered me that at times, Evie underestimated Reed's ability to protect himself. 
 Then there's Brennus. I really liked Brennus in Indebted. In Incendiary, he started growing narcissistic, arrogant and overconfident. In addition to being hard to read (literally), he's even cockier this time around. 
 Evie's other friends were back and as entertaining as ever. Russell has steadily improved as a character throughout the series, and seeing him dote on Anya was priceless. Buns, Zephyr, Brownie were also stellar. I'm still not sure what to think of Tau or Xavier. Sometimes, it seems like they want what's best for Evie; other times, it seems like they want what's best for them. The biggest surprise in Iniquity was Finn. If Evie isn't going to end up with Reed, I'd love to see her with him. 
 Writing: 
 As much as I didn't like Evie as a heroine, I will admit that Bartol's writing is beautiful. The language she uses is almost poetic, and she does an incredible job of helping the reader to visualize the world she has created. Iniquity was actually very well-edited, especially in comparison to the previous books. I would give the book an R rating. There are several adult situations; oddly, while Bartol seems particularly fond of the word ""breasts,"" the scenes are relatively undetailed. There is, however, a ton of violence (some of it very disturbing) and language. 
 The Bottom Line: 
 I'll be honest.... After reading Bartol's Kricket series and seeing how it ended, I was really skeptical. While Iniquity wasn't as frustrating as I feared it would be, it still didn't give me the kind of closure that I look for in a series finale. The final battle was over within like two pages, and while it seemed like I got the Happily Ever After I had hoped for, the ending threw some doubt on exactly how long Ever After would be.""",2016-01-12 13:43:55,"Iniquity (The Premonition, #5)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;romance;fiction,Amy A.

1313,676924,2,"""Ok, this was definitely a waste of my time. I'm trying to remember why I thought that this was a good series in the first place. Perhaps the first book really was ok, but this one most certainly was not. It wasn't horrible, it was just disappointing. I hate it when books are written poorly, and this was a good example of bad writing. Maybe if the writing had been better then the plot would have been better ... but no, these are majorly lame vampires, lamer than Twilight vampires even. They can't do anything! They don't even sparkle when put in the sun, much less burn up and die. The whole drinking blood thing is slightly better than Twlight's version, but it's like a watered-down version of Anne Rice. 
 Plus, the mythology is extremely uncompelling and lame, as is the heroine. What is with these vampire heroines being so dumb? 
 It is also see-through ... I knew who was going to betray her within the first paragraph, and I also knew that her friend (can't even remember her name now) was going to die like 5 chapters ahead of time. Stupid, stupid stupid. I wasn't even remotely upset when she died, either.

I intensely disliked the main character, Hadley, from the very beginning. She was just a waste of space with nothing to offer to the world. As the story progressed she became even more of a doormat that did nothing all day. Granted, Hadley was a good mom, when the housekeeper wasn't raising her child (about 75% of the time). When Hemingway started to get really open about his infidelity I was appalled at how long she put up with it. The other woman literally crawled into bed with them and Hadley actually stayed there!

1320,77604,3,"""I'm givin' this sucka three stars, seeee?! Ya wanna make somethin' of it, tough guy?...Yeah, that's what I thought. 
 Actually, Fre-de-Lance by Rex Stout is more cerebral than tough-guy as far as detective fiction goes. Oh sure, there's some strong-arm scenes and a line like ""Don't try no funny stuff, ya got me pal-y?"" wouldn't be out of place here. However, as many of those you find, you'll discover just as many classical allusions and erudite quotables. 
 This is in great part due to the eccentric genius Nero Wolfe, who owns and operates the detective agency. However, he is too corpulent and immobile to be the true hero of the story. That mantle rests upon the able shoulders of regular good guy Archie Goodwin, the man on the street, the guy who gets the job done. Archie narrates the story and his witty one-liners and occasional snark are a great joy to read. 
 One of the early ones in the detective genre, Fer-de-Lance leaves the reader guessing who killed who and why. Very solid red herrings and perplexing twists abound. This book will satiate the mystery lover. 
 This why only three stars? Well, as one of the longer books in the Wolfe series, Fer-de-Lance lumbers along at a slower pace than necessary, adding more pages than are probably needed to tell this tale. But hey, this was back when Stout was just starting out and you can hardly be surprised when a new writer goes long. Plus, this being one of the early detective stories, he didn't have down pat the bebop-beat timing and double-time swinging pace that hardboiled detective fiction would eventually be known for. 
 Definitely worth giving it a shot!""",2016-12-02 20:33:16,"Fer-de-Lance (Nero Wolfe, #1)",mystery;thriller;crime;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography,Rex Stout;Loren D. Estleman

 I loved Makani and Ollie! I thought they were awesome together. And well, they got me a little hot and bothered at times. It was fanfreakingtastic! 
 So this is a teen slasher type book. I'm not sure where anyone ever got off calling it a horror book. It's a mystery, suspense, young adult book. But, I digress. 
 We have some nutter going around killing classmates. And I thought I might know who the killer was but I was wrong again. I never would have gotten this one. 
 So, Makani moved to town from Hawaaii < -- did I spell that right? And she lives with her grandma, she takes care of her and watches out for her spells. Makani had some stuff happen to her over on the island so her parents sent her away. Let me take a moment to say what jerks her parents were. 
 Ollie lives with his brother Chris, who is a cop, because their parents died years ago. Ollie also works at the little grocery store. 
 I loved these two together, I can't say it enough. I also loved Makani's friends. But the main story is of Makani and Ollie. There is plenty of time for romance in between killings. Am i right? yes... 
 I enjoyed the story very much. I liked how it wasn't cheesy. I loved how it was played out. I just loved it okay? If you didn't love it then that's alright because we are not all clones! And I don't feel like writing a long review so here you have it! Peace & Love!

 This was supposed to be my St. Patrick's Day book (green) read, but I still read it in March so it still counts =) 
 I love Temeraire and Laurence so much ! A man and his dragon, what's not to love ! 
 Now the Chinese want Temeraire back. I think it's stupid as everyone stated, they had given the egg away to the French and just because Laurence ship took over the one with the egg in it doesn't mean they deserve to get Temeraire back. BUT . . . that's not what happened. 
 I loved that Temeraire was very protective over Laurence in this book. He was not going to let anyone separate them. So, they end up going to China together on the Allegiance. We get to meet up with Riley again =) 
 Some stuff happens on the trip over and some of the other dragons in Temeraire's crew help them out a for a little bit. I'm glad they got to be together again. And we got some of the crew back to be there for Laurence and Temeraire. 
 It was sweet when Temeraire got to meet his family and some other dragons. AND a little girlfriend, uh, stuff =) 
 Of course, there are some bad things happen while they are there as well. And more people die through-out the book =( 
 I liked the ending very much and look forward to what Temeraire is going to do with his new-found knowledge.

 ****Old Review**** 
 I really did like this book and I look forward to seeing what happens in the other books in the series. 
 There will be some mild **SPOILERS** 
 Karigan G'ladheon is a wonderful character. Sometimes she made me mad with the choices she made but they always turned out for the best. 
 She is running away after being expelled from school for something that really wasn't her fault. On the way down the road she runs into F'ryan Coblebay who is a Green Rider, he has been shot with arrows and is dying. He gives her a request to take a message to King Zachary. Karigan decides she will do this, she puts on his pendant and cloak and gets on his horse, which has a mind of his own. I love that horse. He's almost human! Accepting this request takes her on a hell of a journey hiding from mercenaries, being caught by mercenaries, being attacked by crazy, evil insects. There is just so much going on it's a wonder she even survives anything. 
 I loved the part when she comes to the Berry sisters house in the middle of the woods. Sounds Hansel and Gretelish but it's not :) The Berry sisters are really cool and have a lot of magical stuff in their house. They have these poor servants that are invisible and you can't hear them speak. Their father put a curse on them years ago before his death and could never find an incantation to correct it. Although, it's a cool thought to always have someone around you, they could just watch you while you do anything, plus it's sad for them. 
 The pendant of the Green Rider has magic as well and Karigan can make herself and the horse invisible! That is so cool and this is one of the reasons she makes me mad at times when she doesn't use it. But I digress. It does sap her energy so there is that. Oh, and the sisters gave her a moonstone that will help keep her warm and light her way, as it chose her. They gave her some other little things that came in handy. 
 This is a really good book with a lot of evilness, fighting, magic, creatures, and sneaky little jerks all over the place. 
 I think anyone that likes these kind of high fantasy novels would like this book.

 Many people called this a morality tale. Others said it was a fairy tale. I breezed through this novel hoping for more, and Toibin never gave it to me. I recognize the masterful crafting of the book, but I never connected to the characters beyond a grudging admiration of the writing. 
 For a book that was twice short-listed for a Booker Prize, I expected a bit more involvement. The topic, immigration to the United States, could resonate with almost every American - we are a country filled with stories of displacement, homesickness, and hope.

I don't mean to say that I'd moved back to that horrible, horrible apartment I lived in for years in the early 2000s, but rather that I was in the entertainment industry. More specifically, everyone I knew--from my friends, to my sister, to one of my co-workers--had been cast in a movie. It was a big musical, the kind they don't make anymore, really, and it was all anybody could talk about. One day, I rode to work with my sister and Bradley Cooper in a gondola sort of contraption that lifted us high over the 10 freeway. And then Bradley Cooper told me I was fat, and I told him I could kick his ass. And then I woke up. And fuck Bradley Cooper, seriously. 
 I digress. What I loved about this book -- aside from its easy prose, its sure-handed sense of character -- was the descriptions of the kind of Hollywood I dreamed about. Laura Lamont, formerly Elsa Emerson, moves from Wisconsin to LA to become a movie star, and then, well, she does. And of course there are fabulous things to be described: her house in Beverly Hills, the lot at Gardner Brothers (the studio that made her a star), her marriage to studio chief Irving Green (One thing I never really realized before reading this book -- actors didn't need agents during the studio system's heyday because the studio called all the shots). But there is also the cruelty of that world, the way that world could just forget you. Straub writes about both sides of Hollywood here and the effect is wonderful. 
 There are two very difficult kinds of novels to pull off. One is the novel that takes place in one day. The other is the novel that takes place in a lifetime. This is the latter, and it's done very well. I think the second half is stronger than the first half, as the real pleasure of the book is seeing what becomes of Laura and her children (I found the son, Junior, especially well-drawn). Despite being movie stars and moguls, the characters felt very real to me throughout.

1350,14064,5,"""Loneliness, prejudice and the will to survive... 
 Robert Neville is the only human left in his neighbourhood and possibly in the world. It's some months since a devastating plague swept through humanity, killing many and turning the rest into vampires. For some reason, Neville alone seemed to be immune. Now he spends each night barricaded into his house, surrounded by all the traditional anti-vampire weapons - garlic, crosses, mirrors - while a growing horde of vampires gathers outside howling for his blood. By day, the vampires go into a coma-like sleep and Neville uses this time to fight back the only way he can - by killing as many of them as he can find. 
 Put away your anti-vampire fiction prejudices for a moment. The book is sci-fi in the sense that it's set in a near-future and involves a plague, Neville's world is about as dystopian as you can get and there are passages of great horror writing. But Matheson combines all these genres to produce something that is fundamentally about humanity - about loneliness, prejudice and the overwhelming will to survive. 
 The story is told from Neville's perspective, though in the third person, and begins by showing his day-to-day existence - checking his house is still secure, making good any damage the vampires have done the night before, collecting any supplies he might need from the abandoned grocery stores. Then if there's enough daylight left, he takes his stock of wooden stakes and hunts for vampires. The horrors of the plague are never far from his mind, though, and it's through his memories that the reader learns what happened at that time. And Neville hasn't given up all hope yet, either that there might be other people who escaped with their humanity intact, or that by studying the medical books in the abandoned libraries he might be able to fathom out the cause of the plague and develop a cure. 
 The quality of the writing is very high, not always a given in sci-fi. Where a modern day writer would doubtless waffle on for a stultifying 500 pages and throw in a love triangle, (yes, I am bitter...), Matheson cuts to the chase and packs a huge amount into a relatively small space. The search for a cure is done interestingly, with Neville taking the usual vampire story tropes one by one and testing them out to see which ones are true, then speculating on possible scientific causes for why they should work. Why garlic? Why do they only go outside when its dark? Why wooden stakes? 
 But when evening comes and the shouting and howling begins, then we see the utter loneliness and despair that haunt his nights, with memories of his happy, normal life before the plague constantly reminding him of all he has lost. It's at these times that he questions what it is that makes him go on day after day, why he is driven to continue with the futile task of killing vampires when he knows that he'll never be able to make even a tiny dent in their overwhelming numbers. Would it not be easier to give up, go outside and join them? But he is disgusted by them, a visceral, instinctive disgust at their very nature, a disgust that comes as much from hatred of difference as from fear. 
 The descriptive writing is spare but very effective in building an atmosphere of fear and tension, with occasional gleams of hope serving only to deepen the pervading darkness of despair. Neville isn't a super-hero - he's just a normal guy, meaning that the reader empathises with him (this reader empathised so much, she did her usual crying thing again at a couple of points). But what pushes this book beyond good and towards great is unfortunately the thing that cannot be discussed in a review without major spoilers. Suffice it to say that, when you have finished reading, you will probably find that you feel very differently than you expected to, and might well be left pondering the very nature of what it means to be human. Intrigued? Then read it... 
 PS If you're thinking ""Oh, but I've seen the Will Smith film and I know the story already"" apparently you don't. I haven't seen it, but I understand it's been changed out of all recognition, losing the whole point of the book in the process - why do they do that?

 Well.. I was very excited to read this book... but it was not all I expected... 
  I expected Dante to be more of a bad-ass (antihero) as he is right hand of Lucifier himself. One more thing that I did not like was him falling for Charlie only when physical changes occur in her. Till that he is just tolerating her. 
 Charlie on the other hand I expected to be a free soul. She was of a forgiving nature I agree but she wanted all the things a normal teenage girl who lacks look would want. She was nothing different. Also, she fell for Dante just based on his looks as he acted like a douche when they met and she liked him from the start. So it definitely was not for his nature. Her seeing him from inside was all crap. 
 Blue now this is 1 person I felt was genuine and really loved Charlie. His ending was really sad and I hope to see him further in this series as an Angel :). Charlie should have been with him rather than Dante.

 There wasn't enough believability in regards to Stockholm Syndrome. Her connection and attraction happened too quickly. 
 She liked his cock, she was horny... so what if he held a gun to her head and told her he was going to kill her point blank as he banged her!? Right? Right?!?? 
 Just because she said to herself ""what's wrong with me that I'm enjoying this"" didn't make me feel it. 
 She was quirky and sarcastic, and I get the nervous talking while you're scared bit... but I just didn't feel it. I didn't feel her. 
 My note at 68% was that now things had picked up. 
 I got into the action. 
 Now I felt their connection. 
 This is where the first thoughts of feelings and attachment should have been spoken about, not so early in the beginning. 
 In my opinion, of course. 
 In the end I enjoyed where the story went. The mystery and action of it all. It was pretty touch and go for me in the beginning with the insta-connection, but I'm glad I kept with it.

1369,186074,3,"""I have a hard time rating this story. First of all I ""read"" this as an audio book and I think it definitely affected my view of the story. This is a LONG audio book, 28hrs or so. Now as I have never listed to an audio book before this one I don't have a lot to compare it too. I struggled to listen to this except in the car as my ADD gets too distracted when I'm home to let me focus. So while I started this months ago it took me about 3 weeks of driving to finally get to hear all of this story. 
 So about the audio as it exists here. I really enjoyed the narrator actually. He did a wonderful job with the characters and differentiating between them. His accents were well done and yet he never faltered with any of the characters. 
 But this story is really long and what I could have normally read in a day or two was a struggle at times when it was taking three weeks to get through. It slowed down the pace of the story for me and this story is wordy in the first place. Some of the descriptions are very interesting and the word pictures created are vibrant. Yet there are a lot of sections in this story that are bogged down in rhetoric and I really felt like things could have been trimmed and the story would have had the same impact. 
 I liked Kvothe for the most part even when I wanted to smack him a lot of the time. I had to keep reminding myself that he is only 15 for most of the story. His immaturity makes sense. 
 So why the lower rating...well the fact that Kvothe is practically a god in that he's smarter than everyone else, yet younger, and apparently the best potential artificer ever. He's a brilliant musician and a smooth charmer. But he comes across as arrogant as well, often knowing he's better than everyone else. Of course every woman in his life is perfectly lovely and beautiful, all of course fascinated by him in some way or another. Yet, there are some very strange connotations in the relationship between Bast and Kvothe as well. As a dedicated MM reader, let me tell you, Kvothe doesn't come across quite so much as a lady killer in his adult life. 
 I enjoyed the first person narration though as he told his story to Chronicler and the interludes bringing us back to the present worked for me. I liked the parts of the story where action started to take over, but I swear it would go along at a fair clip for a space and I'd be in it and then it'd drag for a good chunk again. 
 I liked the University (Kvothe's entrance exam was awesome) but the up and down nature of his residence there started to make me feel like I was at the bottom of a yoyo. I enjoyed his time with the drakkus a lot as well. I think I felt like I liked specific moments more than the over all story. 
 I don't know if I'll read the second book, if I do it certainly won't be right away as book 3 isn't out yet and I don't want to be waiting to finish the story. But I definitely won't listen to it on audio if I do read it.

 Least memorable suit for me, all I will remember well are the Rose boys and how Audrey seemed to be the only one who noticed or cared that Ed had gotten beaten up. 
 Winner of the suit: Meet a priest day at church (byob) 
 Most exciting messsage: Rose boys 
 I get it but...: Italian restaurants, mothers and lasagnas for smelly dogs  
 SPADES 
 When Ed's frustrations start pouring through... 
  Winner of the suit: Tatupu family and Christmas lights 
 Most exciting message: Movie theatre madness! 
 cute but not big impact: ice cream and mothers and kids  
 HEARTS 
  Heart-wrenching, yeah? Best suit, in my opinion. Not only did Ed come full circle, right back to his friends, he made a point - delivering messages to your closest, best friends is the hardest thing you can do! This was also the suit where not only Ed's developed character realized the whole game was a setup, it was the suit of self-discovery and secrets 
 Winner of the suit: Marv (like, wow Marv took me for a spin! At first I thought his secret was that he was the guy sending Ed the cards, then I thought oh no, it's something worse...but that he has a kid? Absolutely fucking adore it! <3 You see a real vulnerable side to a side character here, and I truly admire Zusak for how he managed it!!!) 
 Most exciting message : Audrey (we know Ed loves her, Audrey knows she loves him - but we never really see WHY she doesn't let herself fall...nice radio scene + cuteness there) 
 Sad but hoped for a better message: Ritchie (wish his issue was more than just feeling lonely and hopeless...)  
 Final Verdict (7.75/10): liked most of the depth of the messages, but wish I am the messenger was set in the second world war. Nice to explore Australia, though!""",2015-12-24 17:25:53,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak

1385,30164369,3,"""This AR series is supposed to be reminiscent of the romance novels where the hero is rich, handsome and unattainable at first and the girl is sweet and most of the time virginal. Now, the common formula for these romance novels is that (1) one of the main characters will have a misunderstanding and act like a fool (2) one of the main characters will already be in love with the other but is hurt therefore chooses to run away (3) the sex is beautifully choreographed with the girl bowing and sighing prettily and the guy moving slow and steady and both reaching their respective orgasms with sparkles and stars (4) babies...it's usually there somewhere in the story. 
 But then this is an Alexa Riley concoction - expect rough and sweaty intense sex, with growling or screaming. The hero will be ridiculously jealous and possessive - a total caveman, although he still holds the basic hero criteria of being handsome and rich...but this time add on tattoos, a short temper and an affinity for asshole behaviour. The girl, however, is still true to form: sweet, good and delicate. There's insta-love but as expected the guy acts like a total dumbass and hurts the girl's feelings. Girl disappears, guy becomes miserable (ha! serves him right) and desperately hunts down the girl. 
 Don't expect any back story or details of who the two main characters really are and the supporting ones are just there to help move the story along. In true AR story, this is about quick fixes to screwups and hot sexytimes. This is what you read when you just want a dash of sweetness with that kick in your tastebuds. I found myself reading this one twice because somehow the story has its appeal. Also because i like stories where the guy goes oh-shit i f-ed up and grovels.

 One thing I love the most about this book is London's attitude toward herself. She didn't wallow in self pity and just owned it up. She knows what she is, and she accepts it firsthand. Fuck the rest. She may not be out at the beginning but she also didn't hide herself or pretend to be someone else.The ingredients for a typical high school romance setup is present. And the entire storyline isn't impressive but it also isn't terrible, it's just...it. I love Amber from the beginning.

1390,19057,5,"""Markus Zusak does it once again. I Am the Messenger is a contemporary, humor book that centers around our main character Ed Kennedy, a low-life cab driver who is hopelessly in love with his best friend. His life is completely and utterly uneventful, until one day a mysterious card is sent to him which changes everything, sending Ed down a path he never thought possible for himself. 
 I read The Book Thief a couple of years ago, and it still remains my favorite standalone book that I have ever read, so naturally I was worried going into this with the high expectations I had. This book turned out to be the polar opposite from The Book Thief, and that's exactly what it is supposed to be. While both books do contain humor and great characters, I Am the Messenger is a feel good book, set in modern day, with older characters and ending that will leave you satisfied but wanting more at the same time. 
 If I could describe this book in one word it would be: ' lovely ' 
 I will definitely re-read this one day, I recommend this to all readers who love lol-worthy books and a mystery that will keep you flipping the pages.

 AGHSJGJFKGJKS this book was SO GOOD! 
 Let's talk about Ed Kennedy. Ed Kennedy, the underage cab driver. Ed Kennedy, the nineteen-year-old with no ambition who's hopelessly in love with his best friend. And, really, Ed Kennedy, the messenger and the message. Oh, my God, I absolutely freaking adored Ed. He was so relatable; we all know what it's like to feel lost, and he was also a very realistic character. He didn't miraculously become a good Samaritan who went skipping down the street throwing money to everyone; he was still the underage cabdriver who played cards with his friends and lacked any idea of what he wanted from life. It was a gradual character development, and while he did help people and become a better person because of it, in the end he was still Ed. Flawed, outrageous, beautifully crafted Ed who I completely adored. 
 The people that Ed helped were so well developed, which is an accomplishment in itself. Most of them got limited page time, but each had their own distinct personality and voice. I really enjoyed each of their stories; they were all different, but I loved them all. I think Sophie and Milla might have been my favorites, but, of course, Ed's friends were right up there. I would definitely read a novel about each of the characters who were messages- they were remarkable. 
 The story itself was extremely creative, and I absolutely loved the messages (no pun intended) that the book was trying to tell. I would never have expected the plot twists that happened, and the way that the plot was crafted was truly beautiful. 
 And I really don't think I can say much more. There's no way that I can do this book justice; you'll just have to read it yourself.""",2013-08-15 09:52:17,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak

1413,28660,5,"""The best thing I can come up with to describe this book is that it's the most frustratingly amazing book I've ever read. 
 I can see why The Curse of the Mistwraith is one of those love it or hate it kind of books. It's been called overly-long, overly-detailed, and overly-descriptive, but I didn't find that to be the case. Instead, I'd go with the word 'immersive,' a word more often used to describe imagery and 3D technology. 
 What polarizes readers of this book/series comes down to the writing. This is also the reason for the ""frustrating"" part of my above statement. Not only is it full of details and description, the phrasing itself is complicated and the ideas expressed are, therefore, difficult to grasp the first time through. I can honestly say I've never had to reread passages as often as I have with this book. 
 At the same time, I couldn't imagine anything different. The writing perfectly fits the story, giving it an epic feeling, making it feel like history in the making. 
 Sometimes it's just a phrase framed with a negative instead of a positive and while I loved this book, I had a really hard time being forced to reread so often. It's definitely not a book to take to bed with you or for any time when you are remotely sleepy. You need full brainpower for this one. 
 Wurts is an incredible writer in so many ways, but what I really noticed is her ability to combine the ""show don't tell"" advice that's the typical writing advice with the moments when it's just better to tell. Character traits will be displayed through action or dialogue, but sometimes it's just better to tell a few things and Wurts is the master at it. 
 Along with the writing, the structure of the book is unique. After a short prologue, the book follows a pattern with a chapter, followed by two titled sub-chapters and then another prologue (essentially) with three lines that set up the next block of chapter/sub-chapters. The closest thing I can compare this to is Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings, which has set-up chapters throughout to explore the entire world and begin foreshadowing events. 
 Probably best compared to The Wheel of Time in terms of complexity of plot and immersion into the world, the Wars of Light and Shadow series is something full of life where if the characters don't feel like good friends, you'll at least know them just as well. 
 If you want a challenge along the lines of Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen, but not quite, that will having you living and breathing in another world altogether, you're in for a treat. I'm looking forward to the next book, Ships of Merior, but if you'd asked me a week or two ago while I was in the middle of Curse, I'd probably have told you I needed a long break before diving back into this series.

 Echoes from the Dead is another Scandinavian crime story riding in on the crest of Henning Mankell's deliciously cheerless Wallander novels - but it's less a policier than a sometimes whimsical, mostly sad family drama. I could adequately describe the entire plot in about three sentences (don't worry, I won't) and you'd be right to wonder how it could take 385 pages to tell. It says a great deal of Theorin's ability to create a landscape and a mood that his slow novel never quite stops, but keeps pulling us along right up to its mildly surprising denouement.

 On The Plus Side is the second book from Alison Bliss' A Perfect Fit series, but my first book from this author. I may not have read the first book but I can guarantee I'm going to be doing so really soon because I loved this story. 
 These characters were crazy cute together and I loved getting to see them finally give in to their attraction for one another. Logan, being Valerie's older brothers friend, always denied how he felt for the outgoing, curvy beauty. But when he moved back to his hometown and Valerie forced her way back in to his life his willpower to stay away from her dissolves. 
 Valerie was a really fun character and it was refreshing to read about a heroine that was happy with who she was. I loved that she didn't let Logan hide from her and made him realize that her brother didn't dictate her life, no matter how hard he tried. She and Logan had some very steamy chemistry so it would have been a shame if she let her brother ruin that. 
 Overall, this book is certainly a recommend from me and I hope everyone else will love these characters as much as I did. Now I can;t wait to get more of this authors stories!""",2017-06-27 08:56:56,On the Plus Side (A Perfect Fit #2),romance;fiction,Alison Bliss
1423,24357334,4,"""Nick and Steph just became one of my favorite couple from this series. I loved the connection they had, even when they both would have rather they didn't have it. Two commitment-phobes don't seem like they would make a good couple, but for these characters it worked for them. I loved seeing them both fight their attraction after that one night together and it added just the right amount of angst to their story. 
 As usual this author delivers us an adorable couple with a sweet, but also heartbreaking, story and I loved it. If you haven't read this series yet I would highly recommend using some Christmas money to go get it asap.""",2016-12-26 15:19:04,"Forever with You (Wait for You, #5)",romance;fiction;young-adult,J.

 Kept from You is Killian Kane's, aka Kite's, story and follows him as a girl from his past comes back into his life. He and Savvy went to High School together for a very short time before she left, and in that time he watched her, wanted her, and warned her to stay away from him right after kissing her. But now it's eleven years later and she's desperate enough for a job to not heed his warning. 
 Nashoda Rose's writing continues to blow me away and I don't think I will ever get enough of her stories. This is just yet another book from her that I went into expecting something great and that's exactly what I got. Killian was an amazing character and I really enjoyed getting a small part of his past in the beginning and getting to see how different he was then. When he was younger he had a lot of anger and it's not something we've seen from in in this series so it was really intriguing to experience that side of him. 
 In the present he still thinks Savvy needs to stay away from him, but he's also unable to get her out of his mind after she shows up in his life again. I loved his possessiveness and how he never faltered in his need for her. It may have been eleven years since he last saw her but he never forgot the girl he wanted more than any other. His character was very enjoyable to read about and I though he was sexy as hell. It was amazing to see him caring for more than one night stands and claiming Savvy as his. 
 Savvy was perfect for the tough and quiet Killian, in my opinion. Where he was hardened to life and always saw the worst in people, she was bright and always thought people had at least some good in them. Together they were a great mix of personalities and also had amazing sexual chemistry. I loved the scenes with them together and I will be re-reading this book many times for that alone. 
 Bottom line, please please please read this book. Even if you haven't read the rest of the books I still beg you to pick this one up since it can be read as a standalone. Though, I love the other characters just as much as I loved Killian and Savvy so I hope you'll read those books too.

 In any case, thank you Neal Shusterman because THIS is how you end a series (I'm looking at you, Allegiant). I was sad, I was happy, but most importantly I felt CLOSURE. I felt like everyone got some sort of ending to their story and, for me, it made the whole series feel more complete. But the ending, especially, was just so damn happy! I just wanted to cheer for all of them...but like every other book in this series it also made you think, and I think that, most of all, is what makes these books more than just good stories.

1429,17449965,5,"""Looking for a heroine you can root for? A hero that sweeps you off your feet? A love story for the ages? If your answers to those questions are yes, yes, YES, don't read this novella. 
 The main character's name is Sienna (at least for now it is). She's everything I wanted Dante Walker (from The Collector) to be. Like him, her job is to ruin people and where Dante is after souls, she's after money. She's part of an elite agency of women that seduces and sleeps with rich men so that their abused, neglected or abandoned wives can catch them in the act of cheating and their prenuptial agreement will be null and void. She's an arrogant, unapologetic and unflinching chameleon. Which is why she's the best. 
 The story is told through her perspective and the writing is somewhat detached and methodical but this is by design because it reflects Sienna's personality, her inner monologue. She's absolutely steadfast in her pursuit of Daniel Silva, her latest Target. Not everything goes to plan along the way but Sienna is able to detach herself so much from her emotions that she's able to remain fully in control of almost every situation, having years of training to prepare her to do so. Oh, and Daniel? Don't hope that he's going to become some sort of love interest or that you might feel an iota of pity for him along the way. You won't. He's a douchebag. 
 I almost can't believe I liked this so much. I've tried to read Nicole Williams before (Crash) and she was a DNF for me. This series looks like it will be different. It's NEW. As in, I've never seen this premise before and I'm really excited to see where she goes with it. I think there could be a special place in my jaded little heart for it providing she doesn't screw it up. 
 That said, this book is NOT for everybody. Some people might hate this character and some might love her. I see very little room for in-betweeners here.

 This was me at the beginning of this book: 
 This was me at the end of the book: 
 I suppose I should start at the beginning because I'm having trouble sorting out my thoughts here. Based on the blurb I'd read I expected this book to be intense. I didn't expect it to be funny but surprisingly it was, at least in the beginning. The story opens with Dante in New Orleans and we get a peek into his mind. He's self absorbed and overconfident. Hypothetically that arrogance would annoy me. In actuality I thought it was done with enough humor to make it charming and the fact that he could admit to his weaknesses (fear of cats, which he describes as having ""creepy little teeth and finger blades"") brought him back down to earth for me and made him likeable. 
 Onto the story. I loved the premise. I thought it was a fresh take on the whole heaven/hell, angels/demons paradigm. I loved the fact that Charlie was a ""Nerd Alert"". She's your typical teenager caught smack dab in the middle of her awkward phase, complete with acne, glasses, frizzy hair and poor fashion sense. She also has a huge heart and the potential to affect a lot of people's lives with her vision of a more charitable future. 
 I was so excited for the dynamic between these two because Dante is the type of boy most teenage girls would throw themselves at and Charlie is the type of girl that most teenage boys don't even see. I wanted Dante to see her, to see the beauty beneath her skin and fall in love with her quirky personality, her ever present smiles and her huge heart. Sadly, things didn't quit happen the way I wanted them to. 
 I think everything started going wrong for me when Dante was able to convince her she needed to be beautiful. After that, I frowned a lot. I started having more issues but I won't go into them because they'd be spoilers and I want to let people form their own opinions. 
 I just...ugh. This book had so much potential and I just felt like it didn't live up to it.""",2013-03-21 06:05:23,"The Collector (Dante Walker, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Victoria Scott

 I'm not big on romance stories, but this was approached in a different way. I knew from the beginning it ended badly, but I loved the characters so much that I still hoped it would work out for them. It made me appreciate my own relationship with my fiance in a whole new way, never wanting us to feel the heartbreak Hadley and Ernest felt from their divorce. 
 I love getting a glimpse into the lives of famous writers, even when it's fictionalized, as this is though it's built on truth. Unfortunately, I saw a lot of similarities between me and Ernest and it made me wonder if all writers aren't a little sad and self-destructive. There's so much to learn about the craft of writing by observing other writer's daily lives and routines, I believe, and this was a wonderful story that showed me how Ernest Hemmingway functioned, not only as a husband but also as a writer.

 It is a rich and believable world with characters that are easy to identify with and root for. The line-by-line writing is at times lyrical and beautiful, but never distracts from becoming immersed in the story. 
 If you want an escape that makes you long for more, don't read more about the plot, just buy it and discover it. 
 There are two possible drawbacks to this novel. 
 First, it is the premier novel in a trilogy and the third book isn't done (as of April 2012). If you get drawn into this world only to have to wait for the next book, it might be very painful. 
 Second, it is the life story of a bard as told by him. For this reason, it winds its way slowly through the tale of his life, meandering from place to place without a clear goal at times (this is more true of the second book but at times true for this one as well).

The best word to describe it would be 'a rough start'. And from that point,it got even better and better with every page. One could only go up from the very bottom, well, at least that's what people say. Sure, the were some things that left me frustrated like, for e.g. when the main chracters misunderstood each other and refused to interact. Like seriously, half of things could have been avoided if people just simply TALKED. There were also places in the book, where I forgot that this was in western settings, not some fairy-tale fantasy ones.

Having already seen the film, I was surprised by just how little Nick Hornby changed in adapting it. It lulled me into the same deeply cathartic but completely comforting emotional state. 
 Perhaps the most striking change in adapting it was how to portray Eilis's deeply internal turmoil onscreen, although Saoirse Ronan's wonderful performance probably worked most of the magic. What struck me most was how quotidian this book was: obsessed with the small details of everyday life. It reminded me a lot of 
 The Women In Black

 But also, what's clever about this novel is the way that life, as we experience it, is an accretion of everyday details, and it's in submitting to these quotidian rhythms that we're lulled into not recognising the changes in ourselves and our environments, except when we wonder that our past selves and lives feel so hazy and indistinct and faraway, in a way that makes us feel uneasy now. 
 The other main theme of the novel for me was the vast, unexpressed inner life that goes unshared between people, even close friends and family, whether it's Eilis's brothers not wanting to explain how devastatingly lonely migration was for them, Rose quietening her own dreams and being silent about her health, or their mother, who becomes completely, frustratingly enigmatic to Eilis. Being the product of such radical reticence, no wonder Eilis is unable to tell anyone how she truly feels, and is almost a mystery to herself. 
 Toibin's observations about Eilis's competing love interests are more finely wrought than in the film, too. The actors' performances were all so charming that we understand intuitively why Eilis is torn between Tony and Jim; but the novel is much more incisive in describing how they differ in Eilis's eyes. 
 Basically, quiet, genteel Jim represents something safe and familiar but also something inherently conservative, while curious, funny Tony represents an adventurous future. Recognising how migration has changed her, Eilis can't help choosing the lover who represents change. 
 Another thing I found quite striking is the suggestion that Eilis's work supervisor is hitting on her as she helps her try on swimsuits. It struck me as a very Carol kind of moment in a book that could perhaps even take place in the same New York as Patricia Highsmith's novel

1455,29780258,0,"""I am ambivalent about this book. I am interested in Trevor Noah's liminal status under apartheid in South Africa. I was also moved by the story of his mother and Trevor's relationship with her. On the other hand, I could have done without the history of his dates as a teenager and his other more typical adolescent experiences. There is also a highly controversial chapter whose title is a spoiler for the controversy. So I'm going to use spoiler tags. The ""Go Hitler"" chapter dealing with a dancer whose actual name is Hitler, seemed insensitive to me. I understand that Trevor's education didn't deal very much with World War II. I also understand that Jews aren't the only ethnic group who have had a history of genocide. Yet the adult Trevor Noah shows no empathy for the people at the Jewish school. I could see in his description of the interchange in that scene that there was severe miscommunication involved. He interpreted their feelings of offense as racist. If he could have stepped out of that scene and told us that as an adult he regrets any pain his chanting of ""Go Hitler"" caused for his Jewish audience, I would have had no problem with the chapter. Yet I wonder if he does have any regrets regarding this incident. There is a Hollywood Reporter article that listed Trevor Noah's anti-semitic tweets at http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news.... This makes me feel less charitable in my interpretation of Trevor Noah's motives for including the ""Go Hitler"" chapter.  My non-spoiler discussion about this issue is that some forms of comedy rely on unfortunate stereotypes. I dislike that sort of humor intensely because I believe that it reinforces the stereotypes. On the basis of the controversial chapter and information related to it that I included in my spoiler discussion, I would tend to think that Trevor Noah doesn't find such stereotypical humor problematic.

 Ugh this series. 
 THIS SERIES! 
 Unwind, UnWholly, UnSouled, Undivided 
 *sings*Why you gotta be so good? 
 I loved every bit of the characters' journey, starting with Connor finding out about his unwind order in the first book, to Connor somehow forgiving his parents in the last book . I had to wait for a few months for Unsouled last year and a whole year for Undivided, and it was all worth it. 
 I knew even back then that the Unwind Dystology will certainly be one of my favorite series, but I didn't know exactly why. Now I do. 
 Because this book is scary. 
 Not the scary type that has ghosts in it, but had me thinking and up most of the night just the same. Some reviewers already mentioned this but I really need to emphasize it: The world told in this story is too close for comfort. You don't believe me? Just look up the articles found in the beginning of every part in this book and the others before it. I did. And everything was authentic. 
 This book definitely had a lot of surprises and an even bigger collection of weird. A lot bigger. And by that I mean potting human beings (as in planting people in a huge vase filled with soil with only their heads on the surface), ""borrowing"" half of a person's face (take note: they harvested it while the unwilling donor is conscious and they still let him live to tell the tale), and more in store for all you interested readers. 
 As for the ending, there were still some loose ends that drives me crazy with the hunger for answers. I also disagree with what happened in the ending, but I think I get where Connor, the main character, is coming from. I just don't think I would've done the same if it were me. 
 Neal Shusterman really created a realistic futuristic world that was haunting and thought-provoking.

 Romeo and Juliet in mafia world. Yes, the story is about starcrossed lovers. Meet Matty Barsanti, GQ model worthy. He is the oldest son of one of New York most powerful mafia family. Gone for some years for his own safety, he is back in town as his mother is dying. 
 Reluctant to help in the family affairs, he tries to stay away from the lifestyle. 
 For 16 years now, the Barsanti are at war with the Galante, the other ruling mob family.

1468,186074,5,"""It's hard to come up with a scoring for this book, or worse, a review. But I'll try anyway. 
 Let's start by saying that this book did not live up to my expectations, at all. Luckily, for once, this is not a bad thing. 
 Expectations unearthed 
 I went in there thinking I would get a Harry Potter clone, even more so once I learned about 'The University' where they teach 'magic', about some unfailing adolescent that does some epic, world-changing/saving stuff that no one else seems to be able to handle. I deducted about that much from the (mostly) spoiler-free reviews I had read, but since this got the highest overall rating of my to-read list, I decided to give it a go anyway. 
 Sooo, Harry Potter clone? Nothing could be farther from the truth. Not in a million years would J.K Rowling allow her precious main character to be publicly whipped (twice - while on drugs) for standing up for himself . Kvothe is as real and gritty as they come. He becomes an orphan when he's about 9 years old and in stead of shrugging it off like a classic hero and setting of on a quest for revenge, the death of his parents causes him to retreat into an almost catatonic state for 3 years while living on the streets of one of the biggest cities in the world. The constant focus on his poverty runs like a red line throughout the story. He doesn't get things handed to him, he has to work to get things. Money is really precious to him, and at times we see him act crazy despite of his poverty. Throughout the entire story, his actions are a constant reminder that he is in fact still a child/teen who makes the same mistakes you can expect from any kid that age in this world as well. That for, among other things, is what really sets this book apart for me. It's not grand (well, it is in places, but not how you would expect it), but it's real, and it's interesting.  
 Epic fantasy, well that one is a bit more tricky. It's not an epic battle of good vs. evil in the traditional sense (or at least, it doesn't look like it at this time). In stead it's the story of a hero, from his point of view, and from the worlds. It's the struggle of a child, to live, to grow and to find peace. It's epic, not in it's scale of events, or the number of lives it encompasses, but it's epic in the way it draws you in, in the intricate and deep world that is the Hero's life. 
 Pacing & writing 
 As with most fantasy novels, it takes you a while to get involved in the story, and this was no exception. However, seeing as how I read this immediately after A Memory of Light, I was amazed at how fast the story actually drew me in. The first 100 pages were a bit of a slur while I waited for something to actually happen, but in honesty, basics must be set before any good story can take off. 
 After that initial set-up, the story gallops on at a steady, pleasant page, and it's hard to turn it down. The writing style is very likeable, lighthearted and full of wit. This creates some great moments that made me chuckle out loud. 
 It felt exactly like someone had hit me in the head with a church 
  
 ""Took an arrow in the knee on my way through the Eld three summers ago. It gives out now and then."" Intended or not, this Skyrim reference made me laugh. 
 I refuse to tell the rest of this story with you making blubbery cow eyes at me 
 Apart from the wit, there are some descriptionary gems laying around that I just had to read a couple of times to truly appreciate their greatness. 
 Outside the Waystone Inn the air lay still and heavy on the empty dirt road that ran through the center of town.The sky was a featureless grey sheet of cloud that looked as if it wanted to rain but couldn't quite work up the energy 
 His sword was pale and elegant. When it moved, it cut the air with a brittle sound. It reminded me of the quiet that settles on the coldest days in winter when it hurts to breathe and everything is still. 
 The one called Cinder sheathed his sword with the sound of a tree cracking under the weight of winter ice. 
 Lore 
 The world building is solid and worthwile and a few things were truly refreshing for a fantasy novel (e.g 'magic' system and dragons!). Character development is where this book truly shines and I found myself really feeling for Kvothe. Exclaiming when he did something stupid, grinning when he gave a witty retort and smiling at his obviously unexperianced approach of women and 'those touchy feeling stuff'. His constant struggle to chase his dreams is truly inspiring without making him into some holy unfailing stereotype hero. 
 Conclusion 
 I gladly give this a 5/5 score. It's refreshing, grittingly real, but all in all, very immersive. Kvothe feels alive and, despite his young age, is a very relatable character.""",2013-03-19 11:08:08,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... 
 Like the reviewer, at the end of the day I'm just not all that interested in why people choose not to have children. I guess I went into this book hoping it would shine light on what life is like without children and how childless couples deal with the pressure of living in a society that is still largely built around the idea of a traditional, nuclear family. There was a little of that, but mostly the essays in this collection outline how and why the writers reached the decision that parenting wasn't for them. Turns out, the subtitle (""Sixteen Writes On The Decision Not To Have Kids"") is spot on. If you're more interested in understanding the implications of that decision, this book isn't all that helpful. 
 That said, I did find this quote from Jeanne Safer's essay worth writing down for future reference ... 
 ""The problem is that there is nobody alive who is not lacking anything - no mother, no nonmother, no man. The perfect life does not and never will exist, and to assert otherwise perpetuates the pernicious fantasy: that it's possible to live without regrets. There is no life without regrets. Every important choice has its benefits and its deficits, whether or not people admit it or even recognize the fact: no mother has the radical, lifelong freedom that is essential to my happiness. I will never know the intimacy with, or have the impact on, a child that a mother has.

 Well that was disappointing. This was a bit of a hot mess. I enjoyed Perkins' ""Anna and the French Kiss"" series. It was kind of silly, but the books were adorable and fairly well executed. I was intrigued to see the author had written a horror book. I respect it when authors write books that are vastly different from past books. So often authors' books are so similar that they all just blend together. 
 However, this was definitely a miss. It was like the author didn't quite know what kind of books she was writing. It had strong elements of romance, but the romance felt a bit too awkward and out of place. The horror elements just weren't very well done. There wasn't a lot of suspense. It was gory, but not scary. 
 There were a few nostalgic nods to movies I watched as a teen (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer) but it felt more like copying than deliberate references. I did like the killer's tendency to move items around to mess with their victims, but that did not create enough suspense to make the book work, and don't get me started on the unrealistic logistics. Character motivations were underwhelming and unsatisfying. 
 The climax at the end felt rushed and poorly executed. And I wasn't really that attached to any of the characters. They were kind of boring. And I am so tired of characters having deep dark secrets. When revealed, they tend to be less dark than all the angst-ing would suggest.

However, like Trevor and 200 other people getting stranded at the hotel, he meets Marc, an overworked lonely lawyer. Abandoned by his family and especially his mother when his little brother outed him at 16, he's went through his life working his hardest to be partner at his firm so he could make his mother somehow proud of him. Even though, he hasn't talked to her since she set him out when he turned 18....(Why parents do that to their own flesh in blood is beyond me... I have two sons, they're 10-12 and I don't think there is anything under the sun that they could tell me that would disappoint me to where I'd want to keep them out of my life....pretend they don't exsist... I don't understand how any parent could,. but... I digress).... 
 Marc and Trevor use them being snowed in for a couple days to spend time together, although they both tell themselves it's just a hookup, I don't think either of them expected to feel things for each other that they felt. But Trevor knew he had nothing more to give but the night and was determained to keep it that way... Marc had other plans though, not wanting to leave him he makes him come home with him for Christmas....Trevor finally tells Marc the reason he can't stay and let me tell ya.... it was nothing short of absolute heartbreak. Marc knew by then he wanted everything with Trevor and he showed him how much he wanted him..... Trevor had lost all hope of a different outcome though so he left before Marc woke up... 
 It was awful, how heartbreaking it must of been for both of them, for Marc after over half a lifetime alone and Trevor wanting something so bad then finding it when his time had ran out... Luckily Marc couldn't be swayed though... he knew he wanted Trevor and would do anything to get to keep him. So, when he tells his friend Kate, she rallys some troops at the firm and they find a way...a way to give Trevor and Marc their forever... 
 I love how this ended, I loved that Trevor and his family gave Marc the family he deserved. I loved how everything worked out for them even if I do wish we would have gotten to witness it instead of just skip ahead a year and find out...it would have brought them so much closer and us closer to them to be able to read about it but... it was still pretty darn perfect.... you'll need tissues, but it's for sure a great read!""",2015-11-06 06:12:36,A Fortunate Blizzard,romance;fiction,L.C.

1491,9752790,5,"""I'll kick things off with this: I loved this series. It's become one of my favourites, and I don't hesitate at all to recommend it to anyone else. 
 All in all, Burn is just as full of tension as the two novels that came before it. I had a hard time putting the book down, especially as I came close to the end. There was even one day at work, when I only had about 20 pages left, that I very nearly continued reading after my lunch break. 
 I think part of the reason why there's so much tension in this book is because there's so much happening. We're following four different points of view throughout the novel, while also wondering what's going on in the minds of the people whose points of view we don't follow. We're thrown back and forth between the Dome and the outside, and between different areas of both the Dome and the outside. 
 Admittedly, all of those different points of view and areas could make a story difficult to read, but Baggott kept everything straight and easy to follow without outright explaining what happened. And, better yet, most of the point of view switches left off with at least a small cliffhanger, which was part of what kept me so engrossed in the novel -- I needed to keep going so I could find out what would happen. 
 But my biggest reason for this recommendation? The ending. Because wow. Have you ever read a book that leaves you thinking, ""Wait--what? No, that can't be it... there has to be more... they didn't--and they were... What!"" but at the same time it was absolutely perfect because it fit the novel so well and it was so real? 
 That's what I went through when I got to the end of this novel. 
 The ending was completely bittersweet, and I loved that. The more I think about it, the more strongly I believe that Baggott couldn't have ended it any other way. Not every loose thread was tied up, and not every character got the ending they wanted -- or maybe even deserved. But nothing else would have rung true to the story. The world in the novel wasn't one that would allow everything to work out -- it would have been impossible. Characters needed to get hurt, which means the reader needed to get hurt. 
 If you're looking for a happy, fairy-tale ending, then this series may not be for you. But it is an engrossing read, and it's one that I'm sure to pick up again.

1493,19057,5,"""I'm going to admit it right now. I picked up this book because I loved The Book Thief and have yet to meet anyone who didn't love that book (not that there aren't people out there I just haven't met them. Which is saying a lot since I'm on two book communities and goodreads.) So when I saw this at the library, I snatched in up in the hopes it would be as good. And it was spectacular. 
 I really liked that it was a good book in an entirely different way than The Book Thief. I Am The Messanger made me laugh, made me cry, made me get enraged. It's focus was Ed Kennedy, a teenage boy in a large city, who wasn't really do anything with his life and was hanging out with a bunch of kids who also, weren't doing anything with their lives. 
 This was a very ""pay it forward"" kind of story and I really loved it. I loved that the way to self-discovery for Ed was through others. He learned about the relationships around him, learned to open his eyes to the world around him, and he really learned to see things as they really were. Ed gained an insight to life that few of us are blessed with. 
 I also enjoyed the fact that not all of his interactions, not all of the people he was meant to help, ended positively. One of the boys he helps, he beats up after the boy has just had the crap beat out of him by his brother. And part of that story means that Ed endures getting the crap beat out of him. But at the end of the day, it was the best for everyone. The boy's story didn't change that much, he was still a punk kid living with a drunk mother, but at least now he didn't have to deal as much with the older brother. 
 I also really liked how Ed got to understand the people around him. He had known his friends for years upon years, yet he knew so little about them. I really liked that part of Ed's journey was understanding his friends and really becoming friends with them, understanding what made them the way they were. 
 Now, there were things that were a little far fetched about the book, like who caused it all to happen and how many people are involved and the fact that people just DID it without ever questioning why. But it's a minor flaw in the book. At the end of it all, you're able to suspend reality enough to believe it, to follow Ed's journey and to fall in love with the book and all of it's characters. There was not a single character that I didn't seem to fall in love with and part of that was because ED felt so strongly for them. 
 If you read and loved The Book Thief, then I definitely reccommend this. If you haven't, but you enjoy a ""pay it forward"" type book, I think this one would also be good. Or, if you just want a book that you will fall in love with it, then pick this one up.""",2011-08-25 18:24:43,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak

I thought it would be an archaeological mystery where someone stumbles into an old important historic site, finds something of importance and the mystery surrounding that item or site would come out, detractors would also find themselves out in the open and maybe even a love story would blossom. But No. This was not what I got out of this book at all. It was more of a historical fiction than anything else, and I don't really like historical fiction. Especially not books that focus on the Crusades and the lack of importance that women had and the importance of religious persecution. I'm not saying that those aren't important topics, but they were not handled well within the constraints of this story. 
 It started off fine, but quickly devolved into a sort of mock-feminist escapade that lost its luster quickly. There were too many story lines that started at roughly the same time and when the story would jump back and forth between the present and the past, I found it very hard to keep up with what era we were currently experiencing. Especially considering the characters names were disturbingly similar. I never knew what was going on 100 percent of the time. I think I just fumbled through this book hoping it would end much more quickly than it did.

At best, it's an average YA telling a mildly interesting story with a mildly interesting message. But for what it was, this book was grossly overlong. And I'd deduct points for the writing style, which uses that same irritating one-sentence paragraph style that now seems to be obligatory among YA writers. (You know what I mean. As in:

1499,477338,2,"""I first read Blue is for Nightmares shortly after it was published. I was in middle school at the time, and I remember really enjoying the entire series - including the graphic novel that everyone seemed to dislike. Apparently reading tastes can drastically change in ten years, as this book quickly taught me. 
 Blue is for Nightmares is like one of those 80s slasher films: more suspense than substance. The story itself kept my attention well enough, but Stolarz's desire to create a creepy, mystery-filled plot caused equally important things, like character development, to fall by the wayside. 
 I didn't really care much what happened to the characters because they didn't feel real; they were flat, undeveloped, and most were rather unlikable. Stacey herself was interesting only because of her nightmares and spells. Drea, her roommate, was the bitchy, popular girl who felt entitled to everything (and everyone). She was so selfish and petty that there were moments when I found myself wondering why Stacey would bother working so hard to save her, let alone consider her a best friend. Amber and P.J. seemed only to be there for comic relief, and there were times when even that was cringe-worthy. Stacey's love interest, Chad, was completely forgettable, and her interest in him seemed superficial at best. 
 The witchcraft itself was really interesting to read about. Stacey's brand of magic used items that you would have around at home: candles, potatoes, playing cards. They're something that you could easily do at home given the amount of detail that they were described in, and are used for clarity and emotional strength as opposed to the Harry Potter spells that come to mind at the sight of the word ""magic."" These spells don't always work, but that adds to the realistic nature of the story. 
 Stacey's nightmares were probably my favourite part of the story (as bad as that may sound). They provided just the right level of tension, which made up for the fact that the identity of the stalker wasn't much of a mystery. It was neat to see how these nightmares unfolded during her waking hours, though the many references to Stacey's bed wetting were a bit overdone; while it did factor into the big reveal in an unexpected way, there were only so many times I could read about it. 
 Overall, Blue is for Nightmares was a disappointing reread. I'm not sure if I've become a more critical reader as I've aged or what, but it definitely wasn't as enjoyable as I remembered.

A Game of Thrones is the hot commodity in this market right now, but I'm going to lay it out there and say that I think Name of the Wind is better. Or at least more enjoyable (it has 100% less twincest and while harm does befall children, there is way less child killing/child attempted killing/etc). 
 This is also more of a ""classic"" high fantasy: talented young boy goes on to become a legend. The nice thing is that he isn't The Chosen One. The real fresh take on the classic fantasy hero's journey is that the book begins with the hero, Kvothe, already a legend. It begins where most fantasy story ends: the hero has kicked ass, taken names, and made his own famous. Then he retires. Sadly, Kvothe really sucks at retirement. He's desperately unhappy but won't admit it. He's a bored innkeeper slowly rusting out in the boonies. His assistant/friend, Bast (who has his own mysterious past), is doing his best to pull him out of this nowhere-life, but Kvothe seems too stuck in his own inertia to lose. Modern-day Kvothe is probably the most depressing part of the book. 
 Luckily, modern-day Kvothe takes up very little of the book - it is mostly flashback to his origins. This is the place that most fantasy books start: the hero as a child. At least he's not a good-hearted farmboy. He's a clever, arrogant, tricky travelling performer. He becomes a broken bird early on, when his family/troupe are massacred. After three years as a street urchin, he finally makes his way to the Arcanum (aka magic school). The Arcanum is a richly developed setting and really comes alive - it feels like a magical Oxford (both the university and the surrounding town). This was my favourite part of the book: Kvothe's life at the Arcanum. 
 There is so much I love about this book, starting with the brilliant, impatient, manipulative, kind Kvothe. He's an excellent hero and you can see how this guy could one day be a famous kingkiller (and later a broken innkeeper). Though he does need to learn to ask for some frickin' help when he frickin' needs it -- one of his greated weaknesses is his stubborn insistence on doing things on his own even when he doesn't have to. He doesn't want to take charity and he doesn't want to look weak, so he NEVER turns to his friends for help - he'd rather have a loanshark break his legs than to tell his friends that he is in desperate straits. This is injuring him already in this early third of the story, but the real danger is that this personality trait bites him in the ass in a big way later on (which I'm guessing it probably does). 
 I also think Rothfuss' writing is really solid. He's not a beautifully lyrical writer, though it flows wonderfully and reads like a dream. His biggest strength as a writer is his superb mastery of metaphors and similes. They fit so well and say even more about the situation than most simple comparisons achieve. One example is when Kvothe saying that he was like a lamb lost in the woods. On one hand it was saying that he was confused and befuddled - but it also spoke to his vulnerability and innocence that was spot-on. 
 The one big weakness for me in this novel was Denna, Kvothe's love interest. I do not like her type. She is la belle dame sans merci - flirty, cruel, manipulative, passionate, cold, teasing. It's a male desire that I don't understand. Why does someone as awesome as Kvothe obsess over someone as terrible for him as Denna? It's like he both wants to possess her (she's the one that everyone wants - but you know/desire that she only really wants you) and save her (from all those other terrible men who don't truly understand her). I guess she is the female equivalent of the ""bad boy"" figure - women want that kind of man for those same reasons (possession and saving). 
 I don't like her at all. First off, it's stupid that Rothfuss equates ""not having any female friends"" to ""being too attractive"" instead of, I don't know, the fact that she is kinda a selfish bitch. Look, girls are friends with really beautiful girls all the time. If the ""too hot"" thing was true, no actress in Hollywood would have female friends. This is a lie girls who are pretty bitches tell themselves to excuse their behavior. Also, the fact that she is a maneater makes me hate her. Look, I know it was hard to be a lone woman back in the day, but this is fantasyland. There are female scholars at the Arcanum and female medical workers. Even female moneylenders! True, not many, but it is possible. And Denna is supposed to be wicked smart and determined. If she wanted a career instead of just being an escort/mistress, she could do it. And Kvothe just shrugging and going ""that's just her nature! She can't be any less cruel than a tiger can"" is bullshit, because a tiger doesn't have any higher moral capability or higher thinking (so far as we know) and Denna can. Denna could change. She just doesn't want to, either through an inherent flaw or a troubled background or whatever. In the end, though, it's all excuses and I think Kvothe deserves better than her. And I'm sorry he's so desperately in love with her. 
 I hope Kvothe finds someone more worthy of him than Denna, but I doubt it. I guess the best I can hope for is character growth on her part. 
 But if the worst I can say about it is I think the love interest is unworthy of the hero, then it is definitely a superb book.""",2011-03-02 18:07:39,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
1506,8683812,5,"""This was, hands down, one of my favorite books of the year. It was excellent not only as historical fiction, but for a novel, period. 
 The funny thing is, I didn't think I'd like this book at all when I picked it up. The problem I thought I'd have was this sounded so very schlocky and chick lit. Hemingway's first wife! Who he cheated on! It just screams after-school special. Then why start reading it at all? the sensible among you might ask. Well, you obviously don't understand how I find books. Which mostly boils down to: nice cover + published + someone said something nice once in a review = maybe? And here that gamble obviously panned out. 
 McLain is good. She breathes life into these historical figures in a way that makes me feel like I know them. And in such a way that characters I could have hated I instead feel are tragic figures. Hadley (the titular ""Paris Wife""), for instance. She puts up with Hemingway and his moods and his infidelities and she could've been such a wet rag. Instead, you feel for her and understand that she loves Ernest so desperately and passionately that she will endure the pain to be with him--until enough is enough. As she says in the book: ""And I knew that I could hate him all I wanted for the way he was hurting me, but I couldn't ever stop loving him, absolutely, for what he was."" 
 And Ernest! I was never a fan (except his short stories--I will give him props for those) but as deeply flawed as the man was, I could at least understand him in this book. I wouldn't want to be married to him---or even, frankly, be his friend, with the way he treated them---but he is more tragic than evil. 
 I loved the writing style in this book--very staccato, lots of dialogue (yay!), very much imitating Hemingway without actually writing in the same style. 
 This book is brilliant, just brilliant, and highly recommended. 
 P.S. Read this and then go see

 I love Kyle. I was not so surprised that he was a werewolf but I was with how it was presented. I think that Kyle is very protective of Mac, which is a good thing in a boyfriend, but it is just romantic (and I believe ridiculously stupid) to think it would protect her if he left. Thank god he waited to the end too. I believe the thing I didn't like at all was the ex girlfriend through this book. I just thought she was a side character that shouldn't have been into the book. The book would have been perfectly fine without her, I mean sure she needed to be in it for the main thing of why she was but adding her to one of the scenes was not that enjoyable. I just found it rather annoying. 
 - Lucas 
 At first, I thought Lucas was so much better than Kyle. But after joining the trackers, he just annoyed me and I couldn't see him as a boyfriend to Mac. I didn't believe he was a true friend, just gave in every wolf. I didn't like him at all. Sure he became better in the end but I am not convinced. I don't want there to a be a love triangle in the next book. I hope I am right, because it would be horrible if there were. 
 Overall, I really loved this book. I thought most of the scenes were awesome, only just a few that I found myself bored. This book had me at the edge of my seat, I say again because it is true. I thought the ending was perfect but not the ending ending. The chapter before the ending. The ending itself was horrible, not in a way where it was terrible but horrible in a way where I am upset that it ended-in-a-kind-of-cliff-hanger horrible. I am making this way more complicated than it needs to be. Anyway, I loved the book.

1509,186074,5,"""I have to say that I'm a big fantasy fan and I do enjoy some good fantasy books but this one definitely made it to the top part of that list. It has so many good and fantastic elements that you can only enjoy and love. It sucks you into this world from the first page and it doesn't matter that this book is such a long read, because you're enjoying every page of this master piece. 
 At first the book started kind of slow, but as soon as Kvothe started to begin his wonderful and heartbreaking tale you only wanted to know what was going to happen next which made it almost impossible to put the book down. I definitely liked the way that this story was told which made it unique and refreshing from any other fantasy story. Also Kvothe is a very likeable character and you can't help but sympathize him from the moment he starts to tell his story. It's remarkable how much he has grown as a character since the beginning of that story and to the end of the book. 
 What I also liked was how you followed Kvothe from the beginning of his story and how he went to university and got accepted there. Most books hardly ever explain the backstory of a wizard, so that's why I liked reading this book because it gives an insight of Kvothe's mostly sad life. 
 Yes, The Name of the Wind is definitely one of my favorite reads in the epic fantasy category. It's a fantastically build world and Patrick Rothfuss did a wonderful job with it. I can't wait to read the second installment of this series so that I can follow Kvothe's story.""",2015-07-08 11:33:58,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
1510,8683812,5,"""It is post-World War I, and a young Ernest Hemingway meets Hadley Richardson in Chicago. Hadley and Ernest are immediately taken with each other, and despite the warnings from her friend, Kate, a whirlwind romance ensues. 
 The married couple sets sail for Paris in December of 1921, soon meeting the likes of Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and others who help Ernest with his blossoming writing career. 
 The hard-drinking and fast-living cafe life does not mix well with the traditional values of family and monogomy. Hadley soon becomes jealous of Ernest's attraction to other women, while he struggles with self-doubt. Perhaps Paris will be too much for both of them. 
 Paula McLain writes an eloquent story of Hadley and Ernest's courtship and marriage. Told from Hadley's point of view, McLain paints the picture of Paris in the 1920's so well that the reader feels she is sitting right alongside the Hemingways and their friends in the fancy cafes where they drank too much and shared too much. 
 This book read slow for me, but not because of any problem with the way it was written. Hemingway was an intense and troubled person, living a fast-life while attempting to carve out a writing career. To believe any story where he plays a character can be anything less than intensely emotional, is an error. 
 The book has left me with a desire to study Hemingway's works and the many books cited by the author that she used as source material. 
 I highly recommend The Paris Wife by Paula McLain, and look forward to more books from this author.""",2011-04-22 19:52:03,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

1522,29780253,5,"""Within the first twenty pages of this book, I regretted just two days earlier writing the sentence ""Trevor Noah, while smart and funny, doesn't feel like a must-watch"" while lamenting how much I miss Jon Stewart. 
 This is perhaps the most remarkable celebrity memoir I've ever read. I am a hyperbolic person by nature, but I'm really hard pressed to remember one that's made this big an impression on me. Not just because of the content--which is at times heartbreaking and mindblowing--but also because of the humor and warmth with which Trevor Noah's managed to convey some very difficult life experiences. 
 Born in South Africa in the mid '80s, Trevor Noah's very existence as a biracial child was illegal. Even though apartheid fell while he was still a child, he faced unique challenges due to his ill-defined racial identity. He stood out as light-skinned in the poverty stricken black neighborhoods, but that didn't mean that he was spared the poverty or the prejudice faced by anyone who wasn't white. 
 Noah introduces each of his stories with a little bit of background information on the political climate and culture of South Africa. Then he describes different phases of his life through that lens, looking at how his childhood friendships, early attempts at romance, and a sometimes turbulent family life: His mother remained single by choice until Noah was around 10, then she married a man with a violent temper and he lost touch with his birth father. 
 It's not all bleak, though. Some of the stories are just about the hi-jinks that a teenaged Noah got into with his friends. It should not surprise you to know that he was a bit of a troublemaker and a hustler in his youth. 
 But even when he's describing some unimaginable difficulties, Noah managed to make me laugh SO MUCH. His solution to his fear of using an outhouse shared by several other families in his grandmother's neighborhood? Ridiculous. The time that he didn't realize that his date to the school dance didn't speak the same language as him? Hilarious. His response to his mother throwing him out of a moving vehicle because she was afraid that the driver of the minibus was going to kill them? Shouldn't be funny, but it was. 
 But, the story that killed me was the one where he realized just how problematic his friend Hitler's name is. 
 This is the kind of book that knocked my worldview around a little bit. I always knew that, yes, life under apartheid was hard, but Noah showed me just how hard, in a very visceral and personal way. He also showed how the shadow of apartheid lingered long after Nelson Mandela walked free, something that's easy to forget. But what he really does so well here is demonstrate the power of human resilience. He gives so much credit to his mother, which seems to phenomenally deserved. But as amazing a portrait as he paints of her, I'm left with a newfound respect for Trevor's own ability to overcome and succeed against the odds. And to do so with a straight head and an amazingly funny sense of humor? Blows my mind. I gotta start watching The Daily Show every night again.""",2016-12-21 05:59:03,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah
1523,21853680,4,"""I've known since I was a kid that I didn't want to be a mother. I have a distinct memory of being 7 or 8 and joining my own mom and her aunts and cousins on a Memorial Day trip to decorate family graves. In the cemetery, I remember coming across a string of Depression-era headstones for a set of siblings who all died as children and declaring I never wanted to have kids. I don't know why that was the moment it clicked for me, but it was. The women who were there with me all enjoyed a good laugh and told me that I would change my mind one day when I grew up. 
 You know what? It's been more than 20 years and I still haven't changed my mind. But, just as recently as last week, people are still telling me that I'll change my mind. 
 Turns out, people ask a lot of questions about your plans for parenthood when you are a newlywed. I want to tell all these people, ""I'm 31 goddamn years old. I think I've had enough time to think this through."" 
 I've had moments of doubt along the way, where I wonder if maybe I'll regret it when I get old. I've even picked out names for children I know I don't want (Chelsea Evan and Ryan Cage). But 99.9% of the time, I think about the idea of doing it and I know that it is not an experience I want for myself. 
 There's a whole slew of reasons why I feel this way. I'm an incredibly anxious person and sometimes just having a cat to provide for is stressful enough--a dog seems like too much work for me. I don't trust that I would ever feel confident in what I was doing to the point where I wouldn't permanently fuck up a child. My own mother passed away when I was a teen and I can't imagine coming home from the hospital with a newborn and not having her there to tell me what to do with my nipples. It's only been within the last couple years that I've gotten to a place where I feel financially stable and the cost of raising a child would almost certainly destroy that. I would have to forgo most of the things that I've always wanted to do that I couldn't afford when I was in my twenties, and I wouldn't have the kind of mobility I want in my life, to be able to move to a new city uninhibited. I think of how busy I am now, and how hard it already is to find time to relax between work and general household kind of stuff. Throwing a kid into the mix would be overwhelming. Then there's the fact that I simply don't enjoy being around kids. I'm not ""I hate kids,"" or anything, but I really don't have the patience to deal with temper tantrums, and even when it's time to play, it's exhausting to put myself on the same level as a small kid for more than anything considered ""brief."" 
 It's just not for me. Not even a little bit. Call me selfish, call me self-absorbed, whatever. I know it's not something I want and I know it's not something I would ever feel like I was doing well. 
 I come across so few like-minded females and as more and more of my friends begin to procreate, I feel like they're drifting away from me (whether because we now have less in common or because they just have less time, I don't know, but it still makes me sad) So, I was really excited to read this book and feel like I could relate. There were a few essays that made me wrinkle my nose, but overall this book is fantastic.

 This was a really interesting look into the mind of someone on the verge of a total breakdown. On the day of her father's funeral, Clarissa discovers that he wasn't really her father. Since her mother took off when Clarissa was a teenager, she's left with no one to turn to for answers and travels to Lapland in search of a Sami (Native Laplander) priest whom she believes to be her real father. 
 I really liked the stark way in which Vida wrote this book. I can't say how it compares to her style in any of her other works, but in this instance I think that it helps to highlight Clarissa's desperation. She is thinking and acting entirely on impulse and so it is unnecessary to clutter her narration with anything other than the thoughts immediately at the forefront of her mind. 
 The story is somewhat of a strange one. How many novels take their main characters to an Ice Hotel? I didn't mind, though. Once again, I think that it complimented Clarissa's fragile state of mind. Perhaps only a character who is truly on the brink of something could plausibly make her way to an Ice Hotel. 
 My only complaint about this book is that the ending is somewhat unsatisfying. Clarissa finds out that her mother works at said Ice Hotel and that her true father is the mentally ill second cousin of her traveling companion, who raped Clarissa's mother while they were protesting the construction of a dam together. To add insult to injury, her mother isn't the least bit remorseful for abandoning her family. Upon learning all this, Clarissa decides that she can't really go back to her old life and her fiancee. Even though the mystery had been solved, it didn't feel like there was any real resolution to Clarissa's story.

1544,18880307,1,"""I have purposely stayed away from most of the motorcycle club based series released in the last year or so. I'm mildly obsessed with Sons of Anarchy, liked Kristen Ashley's Motorcycle Man but detest the spin-off series, LOVE Joanna Wylde's Reapers MC Series, and was intrigued by Madeline Sheehan's bikers until the last book when the ""dosing"" storyline turned me WAY off of her books. However, most of the rash of MC romances, particularly the self-published ones, all feel like SOA fan fiction or Ashley rip-offs too me so I stayed clear. 
 For some reason I decided to give the Renegade series a try, and picked up Renegade Lady, book one in the series. It got decent buzz, I was bored, I love fictional MCs; take your pick. Anyway, this book just served to reinforce what I had instinctively known, and I really wish I had stuck with my gut on this one and given it a pass. 
 This book is written in first person, which I think is really hard to pull off. For some it works, but for most authors that attempt this it comes off as lazy, bad writing. To be able to pull off a first person narrative, particularly if you are telling the story from multiple points of view, you need strong characterization. Characters have to really sound and feel different from one another otherwise it does not work. Such is the case in this book. Kidd feels no different from Jenna who feels no different from Chipper who feels no different from...I think you get the point. 
 The second thing authors seem to struggle with in first person is correct verb tense. They switch constantly from present tense to past tense and often have subject verb agreement issues. Such is the case in the Renegade books. In the same paragraph the character speaks in both present tense and past tense, and not because they're reminiscing about something. 
 The third issue that I have with authors attempting to write in the first person is that they tend to way over use passive voice. There is a reason English teachers tell their students not to use passive voice; it's boring. There's a decided lack of action, and that makes for a lazy, poorly written book. Now, I proofread my blog posts. I know I am guilty of passive voice usage myself (including in this post), but I fully admit that often I'm too lazy to go back and rewrite. 
 In addition to the bad writing, the story is also just bad. It's not romantic at all. The characters are pretty terrible people who I could not develop any kind of connection with or interest in. The story is clearly influenced by Madeline Sheehan, so if you thought her books were too much for you steer clear here as well as you will not find this book to your taste.

1549,7634439,0,"""Oh the difficult. 
 I read this because two friends were arguing about it. 
 And ... gosh ... my feelings, they are quite mixed. 
 On the one hand, I kind of enjoyed it. It's almost irritatingly engaging. 
 On the other hand, it hurt my face. And I'm quite resentful of the ways it hurt my face because it kept lulling my face into relaxed amusement, and then punching it hard. 
 So, basically, I feel I slightly abused, like Charlie Brown and the football: 
 Force of Law: Come here baby, it'll be fine I promise... 
 Me: Oh, okay, I suppose this is quite entertaining 
 Force of Law: THWACK 
 Me: Ow 
 Force of Law: Sorry baby, I won't do it again, look he's guiding his sex into his hunger 
 Me: Oh ...oh ... all right, I do sort of like this stuff, just don't hit me again, okay? 
 Force of Law: THWACK 
 Me: Dammit. 
 I think it's fairly clear that this is ... a ... I hesitate to use the word satire, I guess an m/m twist on an Harlequin Presents type romance. And, for the record, I've only read about twenty or so HQ Presents so I by no means know what I'm talking about. But we've got a protective, badass billionaire with a penis-mobile and a never-flagging erection for a hero. And a less experienced, less socially and physically powerful protagonist. 
 They hate each other. Then they fuck. Then people try to kill them. Then they're in love. And there are a lot of other HQ Presents type tropes in here too: evil families, good families, potential financial ruin, an evil ex, blackmail, & etc, all of it basically ... hang on a second, this GR, lemme get a gif: 
 Even the, err, bonking is self-consciously and gleefully, well, Harlequiny. 
 That sexual thickness pushed inside him for an extended moment that stretched to eternity. His body ignited with a spear of sexual heat. The unexpected sensation left him thunderstruck, dazed and soaring. It was a revelation, as if a veil had been stripped away and suddenly he could see color. His body melted into fiery sweetness. 
 That sounds more like irritable bowel syndrome than any sex I've ever had, but honestly, I love this stuff. I love it in het, and turns out I love it in queer too. I mean, it's silly, but it's gloriously silly. And it's not like the sole purpose of fiction to accurately represent your impression of reality. 
 However. There's no denying that fiction does intersect with reality. And this is where things get sticky for me with FoL. 
 Basically, I think it comes down to an intersectionality issue. Because obviously het romance - and this style of het romance in particular - is heavily (and, even to a degree, necessarily) gendered. Most of the HQ Presents I've read have been engaged with juxtapositions of power and vulnerability, masculinity and femininity - sometimes in quite aware ways, sometimes not so much. Ultimately alpha heroes and HQ Presents-style power dynamics are not My Thing. That's not the sort of man I aspire to be, and it's not the sort of man I find attractive. But I do appreciate the sheer whacked-outness, sometimes, when I'm in the right mood. And, obviously, different books inspire different responses in different readers. I've read reviews that found pleasure in those sort of gendered dynamics in spite of the inherent problems associated with them, I've read reviews that actively objected to those sort of gendered dynamics in the first place, and I've read reviews that didn't give a damn. All legit and entirely sustainable positions. 
 But because FoL is queer, it gets honestly pretty weird, and not in a manner I was able to easily dismiss or laugh off. Tom is a mechanic, rides a Harley, and has a muscular, bad-boy look, but basically - since we're operating with the gendered framework of HQ Presents (het) romances - he's ... uh ... he's the woman. Quite explicitly the woman: 
 Law nuzzled his ear. ""Still think you're the man? 
 Um. Yes, sweetie. You're both men. That doesn't change when one of you has had a cock up your arse. 
 Just, as post-coital taunts go ... this is fucking weird. It presupposes a bunch of really pretty vile things about gender, sex and power - and none of them are things I want reinforced by books that are ostensibly supposed to be about me. Even if they're not for me. 
 And, look, there's nothing wrong with wanting to be overwhelmed, forced, dominated, taken. Whatever your gender. Masculinity is hot. Either subversively or directly. 
 And I get that the scene in which Law de-virginates Tom and then compares him to a woman is meant to reflect similar type scenes in het romance, of which, let's face it, there's loads. But it's Made of Problems whichever way you cut it. A double whammie of homophobia AND misogyny that just makes me want to cry. While sex can be about power (sex can be about lots of things, and lots of things can be about power), a lot of forced seduction scenes in het romance are built on the idea that it is fundamentally and inherently and automatically disempowering for a woman to have sex with a man. Which, uh, I don't know. Not my call. But I would like to hope maybe not. Don't get me wrong, I think it can be, but I think that's a symptom of gender constructions and centuries of unequal social power. I don't think having one part of someone else's body inside your body is by its very nature passive, disempowering, feminising or emasculating. 
 The entire scene between Tom and Law simply builds on these messed up ideas: that sex - at its core - involves a loss of power, that loss of power is feminising, and that this is demonstrated by who penetrates whom. 
 Also I don't think the worst thing you can say about a man is that he's like a woman. I don't think power is a natural feature of masculinity, and I don't think vulnerability is a natural feature of femininity. But these ideas are not only accepted without question by the text, they're constantly reinforced: 
 I am not going to crumble like a virgin girl. I'm a guy. This is just sex. 
 God, yeah. Heaven forefend a man felt a thing. That would be terrible. And, okay, if you're feeling super generous, maybe you can squint sideways and say maybe the text is exploring or challenge these ideas. 
 But it ain't. 
 Or if it is, it might come across more effectively as A Theme if the book didn't constantly refer to women as ""bitches."" 
 And I don't mean as an insult. I mean as a general term for the female of the species. 
 I think the sex thing would have troubled me less - it is, after all, a trope of m/m in general that liking to be penetrated is inherently submissive and just a little bit humiliating (le sigh) - if the same dynamic had not unfurled like a rectal prolapse across the entire book. It is Tom who takes it up the arse, it is Tom who sits around waiting for Law to call, it is Tom who is rescued by Law from Dangerous Drivers, it is Law who ""submits emotionally"" (usually the act of emotional rebalancing in a lot of het romances) to Tom when he proposes at the end. Basically Tom is a mechanic for like five minutes at the start of the novel and - while I am very hesitant to enter into the same constructed ideas of gender I have spent this entire review protesting - a woman from the second Law sticks his dick in him while he cries. 
 And don't even get me started on Wells - this is Tom's previous lover, the sylph-like and effete blonde we later learn was only ""confused."" Because tonnes of men have taken all their clothes off and repeatedly rubbed themselves against me in a state of confusion spanning many months. FoL opens with this traitor to homosexuality getting fat and getting married. Again, not in itself problematic, but it troubled me that Wells was so thoroughly condemned as a ""pretender"" when ... I don't know ... I think if you ejaculate while wrapped naked around your same-sex lover there's likely to be some degree of sexual fluidity going on there attributable to more than ""confusion"". There are, after all, plenty of behavioural waystations on the journey between straight as a die and flaming woofter. But because Wells is insufficiently masculine and insufficiently gay to ""properly"" penetrate Tom, you're once again reinforcing extremely dodgy ideas about sex and sexual identity i.e. that sex only ""counts"" if there's a penis entering an orifice, and that homosexuality is located somewhere inside the anus. 
 But, goddamn it, how can I be so pissed off and entertained at the same fucking time? I feel like the protagonist. 
 Force of Law thrust itself savagely onto AJH's e-reader. 
 ""No, no,"" he protested weakly. ""Please... don't... with your deranged attitude to anal sex and your messed up gender politics."" 
 ""You want me really,"" snarled FoL. ""You took me in half an hour. You couldn't get enough of me.""

 I like what this book is telling my goddaughter. 
 It's telling her that she's powerful and strong, that she lives in a world as much inhabited by women as men, and that she can do whatever she damn well wants. That love and compassion and courage have nothing to do with gender. 
 It's also telling her she deserves to be loved for exactly who she is. 
 He laughed ""You may hunt for my food and protect me when we're attacked, if you like. I'll thank you for it."" 
 ""But I'd never need to protect you, if we were attacked. And I doubt you need me to do your hunting, either."" 
 ""True. But you're better than I am, Katsa. And it doesn't humiliate me."" He fed a branch to the fire. ""It humbles me. But it doesn't humiliate me."" 
 So, we have a brash, bold, emotionally distant heroine and a gentle, more emotionally secure hero. We also have a world bristling with amazing characters, lots of them women, some of them gay. 
 It's a bit rough round the edges in places. The naming conventions are kind of silly. The writing is functional rather than stunning. And for people who like their fantasy world building done with a trowel, it'll probably seem a flimsy and lacklustre.

 Sydney Whittaker (Paige) was a true find myself story. There was more to these pages than a romance and that is what keeps you invested. Her brother died when she was twelve years old leaving her mother to abandon her while she was finding her peace in church buried in the old testament. Her husband decides to just up and leave her, by way of asking her to leave, without so much as an explanation. Talk about heartbreak. I wanted to scream in those first few pages before she dials up Brian on accident. Your husband of seven years walks into your bedroom and tells you he has fallen out of love and wants a divorce and then he just walks out into the living room and settles in for an evening of television and beer? HELL NO. I wanted Sydney to yell and to scream and do something. I got it though, she just hit that brick wall hard and unexpectedly. Realization of the signs she had in front of her. Realization of the things she gave up and compromised and sacrificed for, like peanut butter sundaes and a puppy. Seven years down the drain and all the while she has her mother on the phone with her telling her she is going to hell because of her D-I-V-O-R-C-E. That she should be fighting? Are you joking me right now? Have some dignity for from your womb, woman. I would never, never force my daughter to degrade herself into trying to make a man who doesn't love her and wants to leave her stay in a marriage with her. Fuck-No sweetie, I will sign the papers for you.  
 Sydney needed that wake-up call and she needed that wrong-number call too. She needed sunshine clearing up the clouds in her head. I was giving silent cheers when she was dying her hair back to the natural red. When she was buying hair accessories and peanut butter sundaes. Wearing clothes she couldn't wear when she was married. You. Go. Girl!! 
 And then there was Brian Savage. [Please hold while I melt into a puddle on the floor]. Talk about character depth. It was subtle, but it was there. I really absorbed his features and with every page I turned he became more three dimensional. Incredible. The way he spoke, with short words and honesty flowing from his tongue. The way he doesn't care about anything that wasn't relevant to him or important to him, like whether Jamie and Tori were going to do it or not. The way he let his guilt consume him and didn't think he deserved to have something good in his life. I could go on and on about the dimensions of Brian Savage, but I need to get something done today. 
 My only negative thought on the book was, of course, after the inevitable get-together between Brian and Sydney their story seemed rushed. I know that their love is of the fast-moving kind and for the most part I viewed it as so. That said, I don't think it would have hurt to have added another 50 or so pages of them dating and being in love before the wreckage. 
 Putting the fast paced romance aside AND the utterly annoying romantic theme of two or three or four best friend girls falling in love with two or three or four best friend guys WASHED UP TEMPLATE aside. This book had depth. More so, every plot in the story line had range. 
 With Brian, it was his accident. Consuming him with guilt that he quit surfing, quit allowing good things to come into his life. He even took up shooting pornography so he can make money to help right his wrongs. His crossword puzzles. His ""Uncle Brian"" stature. His sex. His sex, his sex, his sex.  
 With Sydney, it was her divorce. Her brother dying and leaving her mother to forget to still eat popsicle's on the front porch with her or throw her a thirteenth birthday party. It's her only having 4 recipes she can make without screwing up and then finding courage to try and try again to make that number larger. It's her remembering the kind of girl she was before she got married and allowed a lifeless relationship to rob her of her ferocity and wildness.  
 Who can't appreciate a book that has many elements working and flowing along the pages? I was impressed, and though I had some eye-rolling I still fell in love. Round of applause for a well written book and an all around good story.

1559,186074,3,"""This book has provoked more ambivalent feelings in me than any other. There's just a lot to like in it and a lot to not like. 
 The story is really a story within a story. The great Kvothe is telling the story of how he became, well, great. You see, apparently Kvothe became a great hero, but he wasn't always. He grew up with an itinerant and friendly group of minstrels, a group including his parents, when one day the whole group was killed by mysterious creatures. Kvothe is all alone and completely destitute. But luckily he's a genius and is talented in many many areas. Actually, pretty much every area. Eventually, he reaches a magical university and begins becoming the man that he will become at the end of the story - which is to say the beginning of the story. 
 The Name of the Wind is extremely engaging. After getting started, I just wanted to read more and more of the book, and when I reached the finish I wanted even more. The plot is constantly moving at a fairly rapid rate, the text is very easy to understand, and the world is full of intrigue and spectacle. 
 But there's a lot that takes away from the enjoyment. Some of that has to do with the nature of the story. Kvothe is just an extremely unlikeable character, for the most part. He's talented in everything. Literally everything. You would think that, maybe, there's something that he's not good at, but no. He runs across all sorts of stuff in the book that would make you think ""ah, here's a skill that he may be clumsy at and hasn't mastered,"" only to find out that, actually, Kvothe trained at this for hours when he was a kid, which, for him, means that he knows more about this than anyone around him. How can you like a character like that who never really needs to work for what he has and who never really struggles? 
 I mentioned that the plot is always moving. On the one hand, that's a strength. You never get bored. On the other hand, it deals a major blow to the pacing and building of tension to a climax. There is a lot of tension, but it doesn't build to a climax, it just keeps going. And nothing ever stops, there's never any time to slow down and evaluate. 
 Women are kind of... strange in this book, as well. Most of them lack any real character, but are described as being 'beautiful.' And that's pretty much the only way women are described. The better looking women are more beautiful, and the non-good looking women aren't mentioned at all. 
 Finally, there are just a lot of ticks in the author's writing that are rather annoying. When is a strong reliance on cliche. Often this cliche doesn't even really accurately reflect the reality of the story but just serves as a lame attempt at flowery language. The author also has Kvothe consistently describe experiences like this: ""if you've never been in this situation, then you could never understand, so I will not even try to explain it.""

1561,8683812,5,"""This was a book about Ernest Hemingway and his first wife Hadley Richardson. It started when he was just 21 and Hadley was 29. The book is told from her POV, and is brilliantly written. 
 Hadley was a very sheltered woman who due to a serious accident in her childhood had missed a lot of schooling and mixing with other children. Things changed for her due to chance, meeting Hemingway in Chicago while visiting her friend Kate Smith. 
 For her it changed her life completely, with falling in love, letters being exchanged almost daily then married in less than a year. I don't think life with Hemingway was easy, but soon after they married they were of to Paris. He immediately started to write, and they meet some of the other great of the time. Hadley was all for him, thought only of how to make things easier for him but they were intensely in love. 
 The descriptions of Paris in the early 1920's was great, the people, the dancehall, you can picture it all. They went on trips all over Europe on not much money, and were even joined by one of Ernest s friends from the war. Hadley learned how to fish, ski, swim and dive, and hike. For a sheltered woman it must of been very scary but she took it all in her stride. Three years into their lives she became pregnant and also lost all of his work, I don't know how they recovered from that but he just started again. 
 Bummby was born and things started to go wrong . Ernest started an affair, but I think that even though it crushed Hadley, he was as confused. They had friends who had all kinds of relationships. He thought he could have both Pauline and Hadley and for a short time.e did. Hadley in the end I think had the best end, after a divorce, she met and was married for 35 years. Being married to Hemingway had made her I to a strong confident woman, someone who was well travelled with lots of friends. I liked the way the book didn't shy away from the difficult topics that could be taboo for the Times like homosexuality, divorce, institutionalized and suicide. Hadley' s father committed suicide and this had a direct impact on how she lived her life.""",2013-09-02 17:32:15,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

 I loved that most of the story was told from Hadley's perspective. She was a devoted and loving wife and mother yet never resorted to playing the victim card. She showed class and grace and humility in a way that few women in her situation would. I for one would have acted quite differently. 
 The few snippets told from Ernest's viewpoint were revelatory and helped make him and his actions seem almost sad. Like I wanted to hate him but couldn't. I can see how Hadley felt based on this and it also helped explain some of her actions.

Just click that button, so your kindle won't be pissed at you for missing out on this insanely awesome book! I promise you, you won't be sorry for doing it. I have been racking my brain for the right words to clearly describe my love for this gut-wrenching, amazing, brilliant novel. I've looked up words in the Thesaurus and still, nothing can quite fit the bill. I can only compare it to the feelings I had when I read Hopeless by Colleen Hoover. I was left feeling overwhelmed by the tragedy these characters faced. My chest ached (I caught myself rubbing my chest to try to alleviate the discomfort quite a few times), my heart hurt and my brain was buzzing with all kinds of emotions. I had this crazy urge to flag people down on the street and tell them to mark their calendars for July 16, 2013 so they can buy this book, because it's going to rock their world. Left Drowning is the perfect combination of angst and sex with a storyline that is gripping, thought-provoking, tortured and dark. 
 Blythe McGuire breaks my heart. To say she is an emotional wreck is an understatement. Her life was changed forever when a fire took half of her family. I can't even imagine how one would live with a tragedy like that. She drinks to numb herself from the emotional pain she carries around. She's haunted by a brother, who she was once extremely close to, and now isn't. You can feel her desperation in wanting to be forgiven for her actions the night of the fire. Blythe is closed off, shut down and barely functioning when she meets Chris Shepherd. Almost instantly, Blythe feels a connection to Chris that leaves her reeling, wanting more, and suddenly... hopeful. Hopeful that she can pull out of her despair and be normal again. Hopeful that she and Chris can become something more. 
 Blythe becomes close to Chris and his siblings, since they all attend the same college together. As they become their own little family, Blythe finds herself coming to terms with her past and finally allows herself to begin the grieving process and heal. Chris is instrumental with the healing. He knows just the things to say to allow her to cope and keep moving - 
 ""Blythe."" Chris looks around the room as if trying to find a way to convince me. He thinks for a minute. ""Your parents died. Your world fell apart."" 
 I nod. He puts his hand on my cheek. ""You were left drowning."" 
 I nod again. ""And you're struggling to breathe."" I am. It's a constant struggle to stay near the surface. I have just enough air to stop me from totally going under, but not enough to thrive. 
 ""So do it. Breathe. Just Breathe."" 
 But Chris Shepherd is just as screwed up as Blythe is, he's just better at hiding it. He's built walls so high even his feelings for Blythe can't get past them. Blythe makes him feel something real, too real. Chris can't deal with anything other than being numb, so he closes himself off from Blythe. Even after a weekend of letting their guards down and really getting to know each other, Chris can't cope. So he runs. And he hides. And he gives Blythe the ultimate slap in the face. 
 I think it was at this point in the story where the tears flowed almost constantly. I was overcome with such a deep sadness for what Blythe had been through, and yet, I admired her strength and determination to become a new version of herself. Blythe and Chris have a connection that sizzles off the page. You can feel it in your fingertips as you turn the pages. This is one of those books that will stick with you. You'll be talking about it months later and recommending to your friends as a ""must read"". This book satisfies all your senses and leaves you wanting more. I hope we'll see more of Chris and Blythe. 
 My rating: 5 heart stopping, gut wrenching, mind-blown stars!

 It was a revelation. 
 It has everything good Fantasy needs. A compelling, interesting world with a believable magic system. An interesting but flawed main character. A layered story. 
 The Book is set up as an older Kvothe telling his life story to The Chronicler, and as it's the first book in a trilogy, which deals with the younger Kvothe it has a ""coming of age"" feeling to it I really appreciated, because it shines a light on some of the quirks and mysteries that surround the older Kvothe we see telling the story. And he starts his story with an amazing intro: 
 I have been called Shadicar, Lightfinger, and Six-String. I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe Kingkiller. I have earned those names. Bought and paid for them. 
 But I was brought up as Kvothe. My father once told me it meant ""to know."" 
 I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned. 
 I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. 
 I loved how some of these names and events are explained in this story, while others are merely hinted at. I loved how you know by this intro that some things are bound to happen, but that the way they happen is still totally unexpected, or that you expect them to happen, but they still haven't. 
 I loved Kvothe, he's arrogant in a delicious way, still very amiable, and obviously haunted.

 Trevor Noah has taken a lot of heat for not ""getting"" the issues that face Black America. Not being a black American, I couldn't say whether or not that heat is justified, but I think it bears reminding that this man grew up a mixed race child in South Africa during apartheid. It's just possible that his perspective is valid. 
 In the final chapter, and I'm not marking this as a spoiler because it's also on his Wikipedia page so it's not like it's a twist ending, Noah describes the abusive marriage that led to his mother being shot in the head by her ex-husband. This whole episode is absolutely miraculous. The gun misfires several times when he holds it to her head and as she tries to get away and the bullet actually fires, it misses every major artery and vein and her brain and she spends only 4 days in the hospital. And yet Noah talks about the incident wondering why God allowed it to happen, rather than considering the miracles that saved her life. He acknowledges that he can't explain what happened, but treats it as a ""silly mom, thinking it was her prayers that saved her."" God is trying to get your attention, Trevor!

1586,31213312,3,"""I requested this without knowing anything about the plot, I just knew that it had some queer aspect to it. When I started reading it, I honestly thought that it was going to be a simple and sweet YA contemporary novel that would fit the spring vibe. However, I encountered a book that was a bit more complex than I thought it would be, with a longer journey and deeper characters. 
 This is the story of a love story, basically. We follow the main character's journey throughout several years of her life. We see how her first love affects her behaviour and attitude towards life. It's interesting to see a love story that is not always happy from such a personal perspective. 
 There are so many issues that are explored in this novel. Yes, there is a love story and that is always in the forefront, however, there are themes like grief and abuse that are also relevant to the plot. 
 I must say that I believe that the author deals with more difficult themes in a respectful way. Abuse is shown in a subtle way at the beginning, which makes the reader see that it's not always easy to pinpoint when someone you know is being abused by a relative. Courtney's abusive father is someone who is respected by the world and she knows that no one is going to believe her if she says that he is abusive towards her. Sadly, that's many people position in life. Courtney's mother is able to escape the situation and Courtney does too, sort of. It definitely reflexes how complex life can be and it shows how much power abusive people can have. 
 Another thing that I found pretty interesting is how grief is dealt with. One of the characters who is introduced in the novel dies and that leaves many of the characters in pieces. Each one of them deals with the situation in a completely different way and all of them are equally valid. We also see characters overcome the situation and learn how to deal with mourning. 
 Something positive that I want to point out about this novel is that coming out is not shown as a really big deal. It is important, however, it is not the main focus of the story. I have to say that the coming out scene is one of my favourites because it's really light-hearted and plain nice. I like how it is not a big drama or a device to move the plot. This is also related to the way familial relationships appear. The idea of family and togetherness is key to the main characters' development. Relatives are important and have a place in the story, with their own lives and their own troubles. 
 In conclusion, I have enjoyed reading this and it was the lighter read that I needed. However, there is something that bugged me. The thing is that the character that is read as m-spec is portrayed as with the ""I don't want lables"" trope that I really dislike when it's basically only used in m-spec characters.

1592,8683812,3,"""Writing good historical fiction (when it's not a campy mashup of presidents and vampires) is a difficult enterprise. For those readers familiar with the characters of a historical novel, and a decent idea of their ""true"" lives, they come to the book with their own filters and opinions which can be difficult to overcome. McLain's book does a magnificent job handling her subject matter. The enormous amount of research into her characters is evident in not only the individuals, but the settings she depicts in several disparate locales is equally well done. The author makes it clear that although the characters were real people, the book is entirely fiction and the dialogue, situations and narrative are of her creation. Well done. 
 And I would have said this book was four stars, but there were three or four parenthetical chapters written in italics and told from a third person omniscient point of view that were jarring, misplaced and unfortunate. The rest of the book is a first person story told from Hadley's (Hemingway's first wife) point of view - and it works on every level. I just didn't understand why those short chapters needed to be a part of the book. Did McLain think that her readers weren't smart enough to ""get it"" from the rest of what she had written? These chapters didn't ruin the book for me, but if there were three or four more of them, I think it might have gotten close.""",2012-04-10 06:36:30,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

 3.5 stars 
 I really like stories that involve a group of friends. This is one of those. The girls are besties and the guys are too so naturally they all end up in the same circle. 
 Sydney has a heck of a start. She's going through some personal hell, and then finds out that her girl is too. This all leads to a mix up of Sydney telling the wrong guy off. I like the way this accidental action spurs a whole love story. Lots of random things happen with a little too exact timing in the storyline, but this conversation is the best. 
 Brian is also going through some issues. Although, Sydney does have reasons to be upset, I think Brian's obstacles are bigger. Some are life, and some are self-made. He seems to have more of a support system initially that she does though. Basically everything is a major life-altering event that both are going through. 
 Four Letter Word has laughter, tears and sexy times. I liked how it also focused so much on friendship. I'll continue the series. I'm looking forward to seeing how the other romances play out.

 Nobody does organized crime like J.M. Darhower. Good lord! Amazing story. I'm so emotionally wrung out now. 
 So obviously I loved it. BAON is about two kids from opposing crime families. They weren't always this way. Once they were very close. Both family's histories are super intertwined. Many things have happened that can't be taken back. Each act builds causing a snowball effect, more pain, more drama, more death and so on. 
 One thing that I want to point out for those that loved the Forever/Sempre series is Gavin (from Sempre:Redemption, the one that overran the construction site and watched over Haven for Corrado) is in this series. The DeMarco family of Chicago is mentioned by name and references are made to Haven and Corrado. Gavin Amaro is in one of the five families in New York. I expect we will see more of him in future books of this series. He is one of the first to know of the affair going on between Matty and Genna. 
 ""Look, Matty, I'll tell you what someone told me once, a few years ago, when I got curious about a girl...don't plant your seeds in someone else's garden or you're liable to get buried sex-feet under with fertilizer."" 
 Genna is different than any female lead I can remember Darhower doing before. She is a wild child. She isn't virginal and sweet sitting at home while the boys play. She isn't involved in the family business either. So while they're all busy, she's off getting drunk, screwing around and stealing cars. 
 Matty has never been a part of the family business. He was shipped off as a boy. Now after getting a college degree he has returned home to take care of his dying mother. He's a good, sweet guy. 
 Needless to say, these two have no idea who the other is when they meet. Both have been raised to stay clear of anyone with the other's surname, but without knowing this about each other, they immediately hit it off. While everyone around them is preparing for war, they're beginning to fall for one another. 
 He'd bought her an abundance of drinks and followed it up with even more orgasms. The boy was a giver, for sure. 
 Be prepared for lots of emotions. There are deaths and heart moments. It's a very easy story to get caught up in. It's heavy in sibling love, forbidden romance and decisions that change everything.

Valerie and Logan were both great characters and the chemistry between the two was sizzling hot! I also enjoyed the humor that was spread throughout the book including a list Valerie writes up that ends up creating some interesting scenes between she and Logan. 
 There were two things that knocked this down from a 5 to a 4 star read for me. One was Valerie's brother who really crossed the line from being an admirable though misguided over-protective brother into just being a crazy, seemingly unhinged brother. The other bigger issue for me was that Valerie makes a mistake, a huge mistake that has some pretty dire consequences. I felt like though she said it was her bad and she's sorry, she didn't really see what the big deal was. Instead it's made out more like Logan was the jerk for over-reacting and then easily forgives her without her having to deal with any consequences for her actions. So that kind of soured things a bit for me. 
 Still Alison Bliss has an amazing writing style that draws you in and makes you fall in love with her stories. I'll definitely be on the look out for More to Love!""",2017-01-28 11:12:38,On the Plus Side (A Perfect Fit #2),romance;fiction,Alison Bliss

1610,186074,5,"""Lovely as the moon: not flawless, perhaps, but perfect."" 
 My thoughts: 
 I don't know that I can do justice to this book in a little review, but I do have to say this was definitely an experience to read! 
 It kinda reminded me of when I've talked to elderly people about their lives (I used to do this a lot when I worked as a nurse in a nursing home and in hospital) I think it's a gift to be able to experience another person's life in this way, and this story really evoked that feeling for me. 
 It's also fascinating to experience another personality. I remember reading The Hunger Games for the first time, I had the same experience with Katniss that I had with Kvothe: This character/person sees the world in a totally different way than I would, but still I UNDERSTOOD where they were coming from and why they believed the things they did. Sometimes their mindset is incredibly insightful, and in Kvothe's case he's extremely eloquent, but still there times I as a reader wished I could grab this character by the shoulders and set him aright. 
 (This particularly was the case with Kvothe and Deena: By the end it's TOTALLY obvious that  she loves him as more than just a friend, and she wants to be with him. But he completely misses it and friendzones her. Even as an older man he's too busy romanticizing her to see what she was trying to tell him.  
 I also loved that the ""Hero"" in this story is basically a bard. Or rather he has the heart of a bard and the mind of a scientist. He's clever and cunning, but he he doesn't really confront his problem's head-on. He's analytical and focused on the long term goals, and on seizing opportunities when he finds them. He values his reputation because he recognizes the power inherent in perception. 
 He does have adventures of the heroic sense, but he's just as likely to focus on smaller, quiet moments: his friendship with a woman who seems to be autistic. I love how he gets on her level without ever seeming like he's condescending to her. He just shifts his perspective on the world and suddenly they can engage and understand one another. It speaks true to the experiences I've had in life, the rare times I've been able to do that sort of thing and it's magical to have that captured in this story. 
 Just as likely to talk about debilitating childhood tragedy as he is about the dangers of [GHASP!] student loans! 
 One thing I thought was a bit weird is that it seems like Kvothe is basically successful at everything he tries, like, the first time he tries it. But as the story goes on, you realize that that's a part of his power too: HE is the one telling the story, and he can focus on the parts of the story that show him in the best light. It seems to me very much like a conceit this character would fall into. His apprentice tells us something to this affect later on in the story. And because a lot of his power is perpetuated from his reputation, it seems likely that he would tell the story in a way that makes him seem even more clever and lucky than he really is. 
 It's interesting that his conceit doesn't really make me love him less, because I understand where it's coming from and I connect to it. It doesn't matter that I think he's lying/exaggerating, it matters that his story gets told. 
 Notes: 
 My least favorite character was Bast. Just in general as a character, and particularly at the end when he bees a POS to The Chronicler. I can understand trying to protect an old man from the horrors of his past. But Kvothe is not an old man, and it's pretty likely his story isn't over. If he's gonna ""get better"" I doubt it's going to be because he forgot all the bad things that happened to him. 
 I also liked that he represented teachers as what they really are: not mentors, just people with a job to do.""",2017-02-21 13:23:59,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
1611,186074,4,"""A few years back, Out of Print did a March Madness for books. This book was one of the candidates, and once I read the description I knew I had to read it. It's description sounded like a more adult and harder fantasy Harry Potter. As a child that grew with Harry Potter ( part of the lucky generation that was actually his age in most of the books as they came out), and having potter tattoos (not the stereotypical Hallows mind you, but the stars framing the numbers on every page) I HAD to read it. Oh did I mention that the back made the main character sound like a villian? Seriously had to read it. PSA this is NOT like Harry Potter haha 
 Now, fantasy, is not my jam, so me taking a break from my Sci-Fi lifestyle for fantasy better be for something good. Last time I did it, it was for the Hobbit, and I'm sorry but I hated that book. This book is pretty hard Fantasy too. Not a modern kid going to a fantastical world. I'm talking taverns and mercenaries and demons. I also had the interesting perspective of my partner reading Tales of Earthsea right now, which this book was obviously HEAVILY influenced by. 
 So with all that out of the way, I really really liked it. This book was beautifully written, the characters were interesting, and I couldn't put it down. It follows Kvothe as he's ""retired"" from his magical life (that appears to have been very eventful and he may not have been the nicest guy). It's set up memoir style, as he dictates his life to Chronicler, a dude that hunted him down to get his story. It's told over three days (cough three books) and starts from him being very young, and ends with him at around 16 I think. So we're in the early stages. We follow his coming of age and its tragedies and how he discovered magic, as well as his entrance into the school to learn more magic, and honestly him being a teenage boy. It is also established rather early, that he is not a reliable narrator, so it's kind of up to us in whether we believe him or not. I'm sure this will play a larger role later, and we only touch on his darker side a tad in this, or as much as he allowed in this. Who knows if he sugar coated it. Kvothe was an interesting character, most of the negative reviewers are correct in disliking him, in thinking he's insufferable, cocky, too perfect (they even found a way in the book to explain away his perfect, it's his ""knack""). But where I disagree, or where I just differ, is that it felt fake. In a good way. I don't think Kvothe was perfect, I think he wanted people to think that, and because of that he was a tad insufferable. He exhibited a lot of true issues that geniuses have, impatience, self-absorption, blinders, etc. The whole book, every time I was annoyed with Kvothe, I feel like something brought me down, realized that he was a sad, lonely boy, that was trying to do something bigger than himself, and he'd never admit it. It felt like a desperate cling at perfection. I LOVE flawed heroes, and he felt so broken and flawed, and that outwayed the ""perfection"" so many others complained about. But maybe I was just reading too deep into it. 
 So with that in mind, knowing I loved it. Let's talk about some issues I had with it. First and foremost, sometimes I couldn't tell what was a poor plot device and what was actually true to character. Kvothe kept making stupid drastic choices claiming ""I'm poor, this is my last semester anyway cause I can't pay"" then every time, on like the last day, do anything and everything to get the money for the next semester. You'd think after he had learned his options the first time, he'd realize that he'd always have options and stop doing stupid reckless stuff, but he doesn't. My partner argues that this is just a flaw in Kvothes character, that it's purposefully done to show Kvothes immaturity, I'm not convinced it's just a poorly written plot device. Considering the book is superbly written, however, my partner might be right. 
 Also, because this was the first night of story telling and the first arc, it felt, oddly paced. I felt that the dramatic tension never really came, and there was no climax, cause the story will continue. I thought there would be some major arc in his life he was telling (it kinda is... but it didn't feel big enough). A lot of little and medium things happen, and then the book was over. Leaving me unsure of if I want to read the next book cause of how interesting it was, or because I really don't have a story from this one, not even an arc conclusion. Forcing me to read the next one for sake of some kind of story, not just a bunch of bullet points in his life. 
 But that says something about Rothfuss, this book was a bunch of bullet points, that I couldn't stop reading and were so well written. Truly a very well done book. But I really think it's missing something that keeps it from amazing, and it feels like it could have been amazing.""",2017-08-14 20:40:33,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 Pros: The characters are interesting and the story progresses consistently - I definitely lost some sleep because I never really came across a place where I was content to stop reading. 
 Con: The end game or base plot line is pretty common in the fantasy genres. If you read a lot of epic fantasy or sci-fi, the story will probably start to feel familiar pretty early on. This didn't actually bother me enough to affect my experience but it's the main reason the book didn't get more stars.

 I really enjoyed this one. For the most part, it's a low angst/conflict read but I actually really loved that because I loved their characters and romance.

 Yes, there are a few minor things, like they don't have the great communication at times which leads to her not fully realizing his feelings towards her, but all in all, even that was done well and didn't drive me up a wall (like it can soooo easily do). 
 Sexy, sweet/cute, and then emotional, too, as well as some fun lines - I loved Forever With You. Hell, I love this series; yes, some books I've enjoyed more than others, but none have been duds.

After he completes them, a second card appears, this time with the assignments encoded, and he knows and fear he's going to be getting the other two in turn. Ed's undercover missions, which are delivered to him on by some unknown person or group, and which he quickly learns are philanthropic in nature, are exciting and full of surprises as well as occasional danger. There is a lot of beauty here, and plenty of laughs as well.

 3.5 out of 5 stars 
 Meet Ed Kennedy: 
 My full name's Ed Kennedy. I'm nineteen. I'm an underage cabdriver. I'm typical of many of the young men you see in this suburban outpost of the city--not a whole lot of prospects or possibility. That aside, I read more books than I should, and I'm decidedly crap at sex and doing my taxes. Nice to meet you. 
 He's an ordinary guy. That is, until one day he stops a bank robbery and his destiny is settled. Soon after, he gets on the mail a card - an ace of diamonds - with a message on it, and he has to deliver each of them to certain people who need his help (but they don't know they need it, and neither does Ed know it's him they need). 
 I didn't know what to expect when I started this book. I had high hopes because of The Book Thief, which, just as the majority of the people, I loved. I knew they were completely different (and they indeed are), but I still expected to be blown. 
 You cannot imagine my joy when I ended up enjoying this - not as much as The Book Thief, but I still liked this well enough. 
 I had so much fun reading this book. It's filled with sarcastic and witty comments. There were some times where I couldn't contain my laugh. It also tended to be a little satirical at some points, but it was always funny. Have a look at some quotes: 
 ""How does this sort of thing always seem to happen to you, Ed? If there's anything weird floating around, it always manages to land on you. You're like a weird-shit magnet."" 
 ""Business no good lately?"" I ask. 
 ""The truth?"" The glass in his eyes breaks and punctures me. ""Shithouse."" 
 That's when I have to ask him. ""Can you really talk like that? Being holy and all?"" 
 ""What? Because I'm a priest?"" He finishes the dregs of his coffee. ""Sure. God knows what's important."" 
 This book is not only good for a laugh, though. It also contains a beautiful message that I kind of liked. It's not too profound, but it's great, and I made this book feel more special. 
 Sometimes people are beautiful. 
 Not in looks. 
 Not in what they say. 
 Just in what they are. 
 In first instance, I thought I was going to dislike Ed. Why? Simple: He seemed too oh-woe-is-me. 
 Before I even mention me, I should tell you some other facts: 
 1. At nineteen, Bob Dylan was a seasoned performer in Greenwich Village, New York. 
 2. Salvador Dali had already produced several outstanding artworks of paint and rebellion by the time he was nineteen. 
 3. Joan of Arc was the most wanted woman in the world at nineteen, having created a revolution. 
 Then there's Ed Kennedy, also nineteen.... 
 Just prior to the bank holdup, I'd been taking stock of my life. 
 Cabdriver--and I'd funked my age at that. (You need to be twenty.) 
 No real career. 
 No respect in the community. 
 Nothing. 
 See that quote? I thought the entire book was going to be Ed feeling sorry for himself. I thought he was a Gary Stu. Gratefully, he wasn't. He reads more like a flawed, realistic and totally ordinary guy, and I liked him. It's easier, in my opinion, to relate to non-perfect characters, because really, who is perfect? 
 I liked the other characters and the relationships between them as well. There were some cute friendships, and other were hilarious. For example, whenever Marv, Ritchie, Audrey and Ed were together I couldn't stop laughing. There's also a great relationship between a dog - the Doorman (and yeah, that's his real name) - and Ed, which I loved. 
 The writing, however, could have been better. Don't get me wrong - it's not bad. I had a love/hate relationship with it. For once, it's beautiful: It feels like poetry at some points without getting to purple prose. Buuut, I am not a fan of one-sentenced paragraphs. Imagine this: You're on a highway and the car is going fast, then you push the brakes. You accelerate again, just to push the brakes as soon as you do that, and keep on doing it. That's how it feels reading paragraphs like that. 
 I could forgive that, but there was something that bothered me, and it's this: 
 I at least deserve something, I reason. Audrey could love me just for a second, surely. But I know. Without doubt, I know nothing will happen. She won't kiss me. She'll barely touch me. I'm running all over town, getting trodden on, beaten up, abused, and for what? What do I get out of it? What's in it for Ed Kennedy? 
 Audrey is Ed's best-friend since childhood, and he is madly in love with her. That's no problem. The problem was that he thinks he deserves to have sex with Audrey just because he ""was chosen"" to do the dirty work. I agree with Lyn on this: That's rape culture, and that aspect alone prevented me from rating this 4 stars. 
 I wasn't a great fan of the ending as well. It was not predictable, but I wasn't satisfied with it. I mean... without spoilers, I can say it wasn't in the least what I expected and it kind of ruined some great things in the book. I don't know. 
 There is another thing I must mention before I end this review: There is a rape scene. It's short and not too graphic, but that can make some readers feel uncomfortable. Gladly, rape is addressed in a correct way that I actually liked reading about. 
 Nonetheless, I still cannot go without recommending this, because I did like it. The plot was intriguing enough to keep me hooked, I loved the characters and the dynamics between them, and I loved the message this book leaves. However, take into account the big complaint I had because it can ruin your experience.""",2014-09-19 15:02:19,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak
1624,14064,4,"""I enjoy being alone. There's some kind of peace in loneliness. I'm never more happy than when I'm by myself. I've said, though, that if the loneliness if forced upon me, it's not so glorious. Robert Neville's situation is similar to this latter one. 
 In first instance, when I came upon this book, it reminded me of The Last Man by Mary Shelley. In both books, the hero is, or believes to be, the last man on Earth. The rest of humanity had died because of a plague. In TLM it was some cold, and in IAL it was vampirism. 
 Yes, you read that right: A plague of vampires. Vampires who had a scientific basis rather than a supernatural one, and I must say, it worked better that way, because I don't think the introduction of supernatural beings would have done good to the book, especially since it is horror science fiction (sigh, like my favourite book series ever). 
 Vampires have always been seen as monsters. As they're monsters to our eyes, there comes this question: Are they in fact the monsters, or is it us? In this book, something similar is addressed. 
 But are his needs any more shocking than the needs of other animals and men? (...) Is he worse than the manufacturer who set up belated foundations with the money he made by handing bombs and guns to suicidal nationalists? (...) Really, now, search your soul; lovie--is the vampire so bad? 
 All he does is drink blood. 
 Why, then, this unkind prejudice, this thoughtless bias? (...) He has no means of support, no measures for proper education, he has not the, voting franchise. No wonder he is compelled to seek out a predatory nocturnal existence. 
 Of course, in my honest opinion (I'm trying to be the less biased as I can), it worked better in The Monstrumologist by Rick Yancey, because the answer to that question was more developed and included things that only made the series very dark. 
 Th hero also questioned himself why he went on living - he being the last man he knew alive, there was no point in continuing his life, is it? 
 He found himself wondering again why he chose to go on living. Probably, he thought, there's no real reason. I'm just too dumb to end it all. 
 The book should have had a strong ending, but around 90%, something very underwhelming happened. I won't say, of course, yet... I'm still trying to process that finale because I have confused feelings - does it really make sense and is that the way everything should have ended? - so I will not speak ill about it just now. In the meanwhile, I recommend this book, and if you in fact read it, I would not complain if you came to this review to tell me your opininon about the ending.""",2014-08-21 16:53:34,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson

But when a friend with a general good taste recommended it to me (probably without having read it) I followed her advice. And I must say that the result is rather good. It's a biography, which is far from my preferred genre, and an autobiography, just to make it worse. I was wondering what a young comedian can tell about himself. And the answer is quite a lot. In many instances it's more a story about apartheid, about being a mixed race guy in a society which was structured by clear colour lines, which colour is his? It's an honest description of late-apartheid South Africa and early post-apartheid South Africa. It's a story of female rebellion and gender violence. It's a story of poverty and fight for success. It doesn't have high moral intentions other than telling. Noah is not the redeeming kind, but has a sense of lawfulness and right.

 Quick Thoughts: This is the 2nd book in this series and it is really fun. Valerie is a really strong character though I think she needed a little more backbone with Brett (her brother) and Logan (her man). They had some great smexy times and their chemistry is off the charts. I loved her naughty list and how much fun that added for them. In the end, this was a fun summer read that I enjoyed.

 Narrated By Violet Strong / Length: 8 hrs and 16 mins 
 I like Violet's narration of this series. Her voice for Logan wasn't my favorite but it wasn't girly either so I was never taken out of the story. She had the right spunk for Valerie though and that is all that matters!

 Read It Rate It Reviews: I have had Beauty Dates the Beast since 2013---I am sad it took me so long to read as it was delightfully funny! Fans of Molly Harper would enjoy this!!! I broke out laughing so many times during the story. Bathsheba (yes that is her name) was a great leading lady because I think most people could identify with her. She just wanted to keep her family safe, go to work, and survive a life she didn't plan. Her sister--OMG am I looking forward to her story--she wouldn't trade for the world even with all the trouble she brings. I just loved that about her. I also think by the end of the book that Beau had won me over. I swooned at their romance and teared up when they finally got it!

 First Thought when Finished: A Quick Bite was a strong beginning to a ""new to me"" series! 
 Story Thoughts: A Quick Bite is one of those of books that might have read better for me if I wasn't constantly looking up when I was going to get stories for other characters in the story. I just never was completely invested in the love story of Lissi and Greg.* I was more invested in every one around them which means the story and I never clicked. That is on me as the reader, not on the author! Though I did like the lengths her mom would go to in order to help her little girl (no matter how old you are, you are always momma's little girl)! 
 Character Thoughts: I really enjoyed the characters introduced in A Quick Bite. In fact, I am pretty sure I fell head over heals for a few of them. Lissi was a cute character and I think really coming into her own.** I felt she still had some ""spreading her wings"" growing to do but with Greg in her corner that is going to happen. I love Greg! Poor guy handled everything like a champ even after thinking that he was the birthday present in a whole other way! He was a fun character and just down right adorable. 
 Final Thoughts: I enjoyed my trip into the Argeneeau's world and will most certainly be following up with the next book!*** 
 *I like Lissi and Greg more now as a couple after reading a few more stories in the series. 
 **Lissi really has come into her own after a few books in the series. I guess this is the plus of me being ahead of my review writing.

 First Thought When Finished: I can't believe it is so long to the next one! I can't WAIT! (I guess I have too) 
 Story Thoughts: I am going to be honest and say that you will get so much more out of the story if you read these books in order. This one built on the previous two with such greatness that I was immediately drawn into the story. I was really curious how Bastian was going to fit in with the rest of the group and was totally thrilled about how it was handled. I am not giving anything away but the way the whole thing played out was perfectly done. I was not disappointed in this edition of the series. 
 Character Thoughts: I think Dianne writes awesome characters. Bastian was a character that has grown so much since we met him and I was pleased in how he continued to grow in this story. His support of his vampires never wavers and that makes me love him more! Melanie is the perfect match for him. She has always been supportive and she is strong, smart, and wonderful at defending him. I love her gumption and she is probably my favorite female character so far.

 Review Updated after ReRead 
 I originally read this book in 2011 but I received the audiobook for review this month. Good thing too because I had forgotten the story. It was nice to revisit this world. 
 First Thought: It is rare when you can be sympathetic to both sides of the ""fight"" but that is the case with Touch of Crimson! 
 Story Talk: This world, these people, and their hopes/dreams/fights/stations really moved me. Touch of Crimson managed to bring you a world view from all sides without drawing away from the root story. In the end (no spoilers) you were left wanting more and very sympathetic to almost everyone's plights. 
 Character Talk: I liked Adrian and Lindsey but never quite fell in love with them. It might be that I felt Adrian was a bit of a hypocrite most of the story and that the angels were a little harsh in general. They were my least favorite of the immortals and their treatment of the Lycans made me want to scream. That being said, Lindsey and Adrian had fantastic chemistry and their love story worked well. 
 Audio Thoughts: 
 Narrated by Luke Daniels/Running Time 9 hours 48 min 
 Luke Daniels is one of my favorite narrators. I don't know how he does it but he manages to sound different in every series he narrates. He did a great job with A Touch of Crimson! I looked ahead and it looks like the next book is narrated by a woman. I think this might work well for this series!

1634,186074,5,"""4.5 (to be honest the young age of the Kvothe really threw me off) 
 The descriptive prose, the playing with metaphors and allegories, and the love of writing the author shows alone could carry this story. While the story itself is not exactly unique, the telling is. The narrative frame works really well. The various genres seeming to influence the book really make it a stretch to call this book just fantasist fiction- the story is so much more. I was reading Oliver Twist at the same time and the time spent in Tarbean felt very Dickensian for example. The Name of the Wind really is a very well written story. It flows well and has a lot of memorable characters and places (Auri, Ambrose, The Archives, The Eolian, Devi, Chandrian, etc.). It really does feel like you are listening to the telling of a man's biography. Also, for anyone with a love of music, the descriptions of the Lute will hit you hard (in a good way). 
 What I really found interesting is how the author explores the idea of legends, and the stories we tell of our own lives, rarely match the reality of the situation. These end up in their telling as much more fictional and mythical (I am specifically thinking of rumors started at University to embellish a reputation and the real story of 'Kvothe the Bloodless'). 
 Some quotes from the book really sum up my thoughts: 
 ""We understand how dangerous a mask can be. We all become what we pretend to be...It's like everyone tells a story about themselves inside their own head. Always. All the time. That story makes you what you are. We build ourselves out of that story."" 
 ""You have to be a bit of a liar to tell a story the right way."" 
 Many seem to complain about Kvothe just being great at everything. This seems to miss the idea of Kvothe being an unreliable narrator as well as ignoring that while Kvothe is extremely clever, it is the immature arrogance he shows which causes a massive amount of problems for him as the story progresses.

She gets best friends the first day at school, she has always been popular. But no she is no mean girl, she says it time after time that she is a real geek. 
 Then there is the guys, she calls this other girl a slut for one thing, but she herself has 2 boyfriends, and flirting with another. There is where I started to get annoyed with her, of course she feels a little bad, but come on she cheats. And the guys, hottest things around, and yes geeks. Like we couldn't like someone beautiful who wasn't a geek. It feels like they want to maker her and them feel just like us ""normal ugly geeky people"". 
 And she has vampire super powers. Yes she is special, and will become very powerful, perhaps most ever. There I got the Mary Sue thoughts. 
 Then there is the language, like totally teen, whatever. Sure I used words, and still use them, but she sounds like those she does not like. Skinny girls, bimbos, sluts, those who wear make-up, but then she is one. She does swear a lot too, but then so does I, but I don't have to read about it. it feels like they tried too much. 
 Forgot, all stars are vampires, all famous people ever seems to have been vampires. Hm.

While her sudden tempers could be a bit off-putting at times, the majority of the time they were a cause of great amusement to me as I read about her going toe-to-toe with absolutely anyone who began talking out of their ass. Like the other two O'Connell heroines, I would be proud to call someone like Anne Wells my friend. 
 As for Cord Bennett.... 
 [image error] 
 Yowzers. If ever there were a literary man capable of making me swoon (and probably conveniently lose my knickers in the process), it's Cord Bennett. Dark, handsome, hard-working, determined, and flawed while also being capable of great tenderness. Cord hides his emotions behind a mask of indifference, but the reader is made aware relatively early that Cord is far from indifferent about anything. Jaded, maybe, not indifferent. His sudden heroic outbursts are capable of reducing me to a cheering, giggling mess (the few times he goes up against Anne's brother are priceless). 
 Now, something that might bother some readers are the peripheral characters. Some are just plain amazing (the Sheriff, for instance), but others (like Cord's brothers) are just plain infuriating. Pompous, assuming jackasses. The thing I found interesting, however, was that while they were deriding their brother for what they believed to be a cold, calculating, malicious heart, they were the ones imagining the worst of a situation without giving anyone the benefit of the doubt. I don't know if this was Ms. O'Connell's intent, but it certainly makes you think twice about those who protest violently against evil and those who are merely trying to live their lives in peace. Anne's father is a vile stain, so be prepared to hate him a lot. 
 Proper communication is a must for me, and I felt that there were times when Anne and Cord could have done a better job of it (both with each other and with others), but the way Ms. O'Connell crafted the dialogue, the stilted conversations are actually pretty realistic. There are times when someone should have just come out and said something, but given the character's hangups, their reluctance was understandable. It definitely isn't one of those stories where the characters aren't communicating merely because the author can't think of a better way to drag out the story. 
 Given that I've been skimming over this book again and again, and am afraid to pick up another book too soon lest it wipe Ms. O'Connell's stories from my mind too quickly, I've decided that this book touched me enough to warrant me giving it five stars despite any of the problems I might have with it. I don't give romances five stars too often. 
 Sadly, I've now run out of available Ellen O'Connell material. So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take my Kindle, curl up in a sock drawer, and sleep (secretly read) for days.""",2012-07-01 07:16:49,"Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold (Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold, #1)",history;historical fiction;biography;romance;fiction,Ellen O'Connell
1643,186074,4,"""When my friend recommended this book to me (after I was stupidly convinced that I read this book already, but noooo, Jill, it was The Shadow of the Wind, i'm sometimes not the brightest... one of my favourite books though :3) I was a bit hesitant at first. It seemed incredibly long and a lot of fantasy epics just start to bore me halfway through. But the fantastic rating here on Goodreads convinced me otherwise, so here I am and I am happy. 
 The first thing I have to say is: Patrick Rothfuss seems genuinely like a funny, kind and all around A+ person and that is also largely seen in this book. His tone is pretty light, his language extremely passionate. His characters, and especially the women, are so varied and full of life that I really felt like I could know people like that in real life. Also not many fantasy novels tend to have many female characters, and if they do they're mostly flatly written, this was a HUGE plus for me. 
 I found the story sometimes dragging in parts and either too descriptive or not enough. Kvothe is a little bit too perfect in my opinion, but I can forgive him that. And that's about all I have to complain about here. 
 This is honestly one of the rare fantasy epics that gripped me and made me want to read on and on. So I'd definitely recommend it to people who are looking for a long, satisfying, non-stereotypical fantasy read.""",2015-02-21 15:19:47,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 Review: 
 The Body Electric is the definition of a good science fiction story, with an amazing world and a good plot. 
 Beth Revis creates wonderful stories and amazing worlds, and the one in The Body Electric is a great example. I loved Beth's world, bringing a possible future filled with nanobots that can cure an injury or all that technological future we have seen in many movies or TV Shows. She picked the best of that possible future and brought it into the story. 
 I liked how she imagined this great technologic future, but kept it real with a battle between government and terrorism that we can be familiar with. The plot is a great one and it has all the necessary content to blow the readers' mind. 
 Although Ella is a character hard to feel identified with and not easy to like sometimes, it keeps the story interesting and you end up understanding her behavior. 
 I had a good time reading The Body Electric and I would recommend it to all Beth Revis' fans.""",2015-01-17 16:17:17,The Body Electric,young-adult;fiction;romance;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Beth Revis

 The Unofficial Addiction Book Fan Club's Review: 
 Welcome to Brandy Nacole's world, in which all the fantastical creatures you have read about before: shape-shifters, witches, lycans, faeries, vampires... All of them live side by side in a world called Shadow World. With a organized society all the Shadows lived in their clans or sections in the city. The Vampires live in a part of the city with humans who might disappear some day without being noticed and where lycans are not allowed to go. Then there's the witches, the faeries, the shape shifters near de mountains, etc. But all the Shadows go a little bit crazy when one of each Shadow starts to disappear, randomly, and from everywhere. 
 That's where our main character comes in. Racquel is a crazy combination of Shadows. It all started with her great grandparents when they united a shape-shifter with a lycan. And now she's a vampire, a lycan, a shifter and a witch. Yep, pretty crazy. But imagine all the things Racquel can or could do. 
 The Shadow society is afraid of what they don't know about, what they are not familiar about, and mingling different species it's an aberration. Racquel has lived all her life feeling the hatred of his own kind, no matter what she did. They even experimented on her to see what she was capable of. And now they needed her help to save their loved ones. 
 She's not all convinced to saved the ones that made her life a living hell, but her witch sister (it's a long familiar tree. You'll have to read the story to know everything *wink*) has been kidnapped as well and she'd do anything for the only person that still has faith in her and doesn't treat her like a monster or some creature to be afraid of. 
 That's where Racquel's journey starts and along with a Lycan, Ethan. They travel to the different clans, finding new people to save or to help them, a witch, a human and a vampire and together they will save not just the Shadows that are missing, but the entire Shadow World. 
 This book promises a lot of action, love, unexpected turns and mysterious places and stories that would captivate you from the first page. 
 If you are looking for a supernatural summer read with a lot of action and badass characters, this is your book. Although we don't feel all supernatural in summer, we love to read romantic novels while resting on the beach, this book is definitely an exception to our summer routine. And we can assure you that it's worth it. 
 We're still concerned for the ending of the book and for the main character, Racquel, so we're looking forward to read the second book, Blood Burdens, and see what happens next, because it's blowing our minds just thinking about it!""",2013-08-01 07:48:19,"Uniquely Unwelcome (The Shadow World, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;romance;fiction,Brandy Nacole

 When I started the book, I didn't know it was published in 1954. After finishing, I dug around a little to find out more about it. Stephen King, George Romero and others have called it influential on their thinking and work. 
 The writing had a spare, modern feel. 
 The book tells the story of Robert Neville, who is living in isolation in Los Angeles after an apocalyptic event has wiped out most of humanity. He's in a house he has reinforced, dealing with competing terrors of alcohol, isolation, and the vampires outside his door, plagued by memories of the death of his wife and daughter. Despite the danger, he goes outside frequently, discovering more about the nature of plague that has overtaken humanity, and also finding brief companionship in a dog and a woman named Ruth. 
 The ending came as a surprise which I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it.

1648,186074,3,"""Surprisingly, I like this book less than what I expected. I expected it to be a full grown adult fantasy (the same class as Abercrombie's First Law and Martin's Song of Ice and Fire), but it turn out to be a juvenile coming-of-age fantasy. 
 Let me start with what I dislike in this novel. Even though it started decently, once it gets into the story telling, everything becomes one-sided, linear, predictable, juvenile, and therefore boring... What I dislike the most is the one point-of-view story telling. Despite it is a one POV story, it sounds like the narrator knows everything, which is not possible. I myself would prefer a multiple POV, or if it is a single POV, make it less reliable. 
 The novel is also more revealing than it is supposed to be. Everything is already lied down in the beginning. I prefer the story line that creeps in a little bit by little, until a point of realization of the WOW moment, when you truly understand the grandeur of it. This kind of thing is not found in this novel. The entire plot is focused on the main character, like the whole world is revolving around him (which is not). All of these drag the whole story down. 
 I cannot help but to compare this book with The Lies of Locke Lamora. The life of Kvothe as petty criminals is nothing compared to the tale of Locke Lamora. It is too simplified, too easy, too many coincidence, not to mention that Kvothe is supposed to be much more genius than Locke Lamora. This particular part is definitely not the strong part of the book. 
 The subplot of the Draccus (dragon, yes we have dragon here, duhhh) is also a digress which I think is not necessary. It can be deleted entirely without harming the entire story. 
 I also can find a Harry Potterish elements here that might boost the rating of this novel: you have school of magic ""Arcanum"", magical professors plus a professor the hates you so much, magic classes minus the wand, school bullies. The only other things that are missing is Hermione. Maybe this is the reason that this book is so popular. 
 But, enough for the bad things. Now what I like. The MUSIC! Yes, the life of the main characters as a- bard-in-the-making is the best part. The songs, the plays, the beautiful verse... Not many fantasy novels have this kind of intriguing tale of music. I cannot wait when will our bard Kvothe will be in his next musical performance. Consider me his fans! 
 Overall, it is readable, even though it is not as fantastic as I expected. So I give it a THREE STARS. Hopefully the next installment would be better.""",2013-06-30 02:44:25,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 First of all, Thank you Elise Kova. 
 Thank you so much for not shattering my heart at the beginning of this book. You've me from the first few chapters. 
 I Love it. I don't know how to describe this. 
 Vhalla and Aldrik made the cutest couple in war. How they synchronized. 
 It's a little abnormal to see the love dove in war, but they were picture perfect. 
 It made me smiled with all their little sweetness in the worst situation. Everything was perfect. 
 Too perfect to the point I had to brace myself for something bad to happen. 
 The too perfect things kept me edgy throughout the whole book I had to calm myself. 
 I didn't give a five because certain things that I felt it was nonsense. 
 Aldrik's emotion outburst at the end all those words he said to Vhalla were ridiculous. How he was totally defeated, hopeless, and just give up? I was like wtf? I understand he was upset, but still, why being so rude to the point of being an asshole?  
 Vhalla at one point was too smart. too perfect in so many ways. And at one point, I prayed that she would not fail me with the love triangle and stuff. 
 and I miss Larel. Larel was just forgotten. Not okay!  
 I missed a lot of Fritz and Elecia. I want more of these characters. 
 But over all it was great. The ups and downs of the book. I smiled a lot with the romantic parts. The love between Vhalla and other characters was warming. The power she possessed became her assets truly. And the badass-ness in Vhalla was just.... 
 The end was heart shattering, but I'm looking forward to Vhalla's next moves. 
 I still love this series so much. I can't wait until May!""",2016-02-04 22:30:09,"Earth's End (Air Awakens, #3)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;romance;fiction,Elise Kova

After accidentally foiling a bank robbery, Ed finds himself mysteriously charged (via messages he receives on playing cards) with solving other people's problems. Each of these excursions to help are padded with pages (literally, like a dozen pages per minor action) of depressing internal monologue, copious sentence fragments, somewhat cliched meanderings on beauty and humanity, and all told in shufflingly inactive present tense.

1653,12063158,2,"""Let me give you the rundown: on an otherwise normal evening, siblings Wisty and Whit Allgood are arrested by the government because apparently they're magical, even if neither of them are aware of it. Stuck in prison and with an execution date over their heads, both Wisty and Whit have to escape. Little do they know that the magical epidemic is larger than themselves. 
 I was originally enthusiastic about this book. Magic? Forbidden skills? Busting out of jail to kick ass? Bring it! However, I was disappointed with this read for several reasons. 
 1) The characters 
 Wisty and Whit are highly annoying, melodramatic characters. Despite being singled out as magic users, it still comes as a shock to them when the ""drum stick"" turns out to be a wand. Surprise...? There was a surprising lack of character development; both Wisty and Whit were particularly naive and showed a lack of self-awareness. They felt interchangeable and reacted to everything with the same kind of melodramatic despair/joy that made the reading experience somewhat painful. 
 2) The forced romance 
 By the time the novel starts, Whit's girlfriend has been missing for a few months, and although Whit is sad, he's moving on. Until she turns up as a ghost . This didn't need to happen and it made the romance a poor, unnecessary part of the novel. Witch and Wizard would have honestly done better without it. 
 3) The ""cram as much as you can into one novel"" ideology 
 The novel had already given us a lot to deal with within the opening chapters. Instead of developing it, however, the novel adds ghosts, strange dimensions, random creatures, a totalitarian government, and a quest to save parents. That's a hefty amount to work with for such a slim novel. I would have much rather seen the introduction develop a world that is focused on one aspect here, rather than skimmed through all. To sum it up, it was confusing. 
 4) The writing 
 In several words: clumsy, heavy handed, and overdramatic. 
 It's sad because I really, really wanted to like Witch and Wizard. The premise sounded cool, and given a better writer and more development, it could have been an engaging read. Unfortunately, the characters were flat, and the plot got flat out weird as the novel progressed, to the point where I no longer cared what happened. However, in saying that, there were highlights of the book that I somewhat enjoyed. I managed to see the novel to the end and although I certainly won't be reading the sequel, I can't say that it was a terrible reading experience. The characters are fairly adventurous and I liked that Wisty took initiative at points, rather than letting her brother take over.

 While it is a ""swords and sorcery"" fantasy epic, it is profoundly different from other famous sagas like Lord of The Rings or ASOIAF. Those concentrate on world building to immerse you in the events of their universe. The Name of the Wind, in contrast, is a deeply personal story, told by the hero from his point of view throughout the events. As his knowledge of the world around him grows, the reader follows along the journey. This has you rooting for the main character even more, in my opinion. 
 Usually if I like a book a lot and the rating is 4+, I give it a 5 because If I like it, I don't want to lower the rating (come on we all do it). But I'm keeping this at 4 for now, because for a solid 150 pages or so, this book really dragged on through what was essentially a ""side quest"". Just know that when Kvothe heads off to a nearby town to ""investigate"", the normally fast paced story is about to take a lull. Given the setting, this quest should have been more significant, but didn't serve to advance the plot much at all.

 *** ARC provided in exchange for an honest review *** 
 End of The Innocence is the third and last part of the Innocence series, which I highly recommend to anyone who's up for a steamy and suspenseful read. End Of The Innocence is not an exception, and takes off exactly where Julia and Brad's relationship stood at the end of book 2. 
 In Masked Innocence, Julia Campbell and Brad De Luca's relationship was put to the test by the death of Julia's boss Kent Broward. As Julia knew about his involvement with mobster family Magiano, she was threatened to death herself by its leader, who is no other than Brad's estranged dad. Wanting nothing more than Julia's safety, Brad asked Julia's hand in marriage at the end Masked Innocence, convinced that the rule of ""family immunity"" would apply. Julia agreed, but asked Brad for a year to make sure this is what he and she both want. 
 So mainly, The End of Innocence is about this particular year, during which Julia prepares for her wedding with the ""untamable"" Brad, wonders about her professional future and her life with him, and during which she inevitably has to meet the Magianos, and finally let her parents know about Brad - while they still think she is engaged to her ex-fiance Luke. 
 However, The End of Innocence starts with a very peculiar introduction: with Julia tied up and gagged, regretting that in the end, she never actually walked down the aisle towards Brad... Now again, Alessandra Torre proves herself the master of steam and suspense. Again, tons of theories arise around who - in the end - wants Julia dead. Is it the other mobs in the area, who want to get back at the Magiano (and Brad), or perhaps Julia's stalker ex-fiance, or even Magiano himself? This read was absolutely stuffed with suspense, almost as much as it is stuffed with proper Alessandra Torre steam and just the right amount of kink. 
 So again, The End of Innocence is a book I would highly recommend to anyone, because it is not your usual office-affair/erotic-suspense/kinky-sex read - it simply is above and beyond. Now whether or not there is a happy end in store for Julia and Brad - only reading the book will tell :)""",2014-03-16 14:04:51,"End of the Innocence (Innocence, #3)",romance;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Alessandra Torre

The whole hate turns to love thing is a difficult one to get right, but Belle Aurora definitely got it right: through the jealousy, the pranks and crazy things that happen, Nat and Asher give in to their attraction, and to really steamy sexy times. I just loved how this worked out. 
 It also didn't stop there, because the book revolved around deeper issues such as Asher's past and inability to have a real relationship, and around other important issues that come across Nat's path. This made the book whole and meaningful, despite the lightly cheesy happy ending. 
 And to round Asher and Nat's story up, every character present in their group of friend was again absolutely loveable (even if less present in this book than they were in the last) and gave a great final touch to the book. 
 Funny, loveable, enjoyable - what more can you expect from a book? I will be waiting to read the next one in the series, hoping that Ceecee's father Max will find his HEA too.""",2014-02-05 12:31:36,"Love Thy Neighbour (Friend-Zoned, #2)",romance;fiction,Belle Aurora
1665,17325147,4,"""This was an awesome read. A bit dark and sad, at least during the first chapters. It was almost dark enough to creep me out, but then it got better. Left Drowning is the story of Blythe, who has not lived in 4 years - ever since her parents died in a fire. But she decides to take matters into her own hands and to finally start living. By pure coincidence, she meets Sabin Shepherd. And his brother Chris. And his twin brother and sister Eric and Estelle, and she suddenly has a new family. 
 Even more than that - she has a very special connection to Christopher aka Chris. It is something beyond attraction or love... it is the feeling that they somehow belong together / know each other. That's all I can tell - the rest would just spoil you read. But god - this was a great read. 
 The story is full of suspense, and there's also a lot of fun throughout the sad parts. And the plot itself, the way the story rolls out is really well thought, because you witness how Chris and Blythe manage to piece back their memories around the unfaithful events of their pasts. It almost like Hopeless by Colleen Hoover; but in a different way and story. 
 The only reason why I only gave this 4 stars is because the story was great but quite unlikely. Is it fair to grade fiction on it's reality potential? I don't know. Probably not, but I like to do so...""",2013-10-23 12:49:12,"Left Drowning (Left Drowning, #1)",romance;young-adult;fiction,Jessica Park

1671,186074,5,"""Although I love fantasy, especially high-fantasy, I was a little hesitant at buying The Name of the Wind. Two weeks ago I was in my local bookstore, this book held in one hand and The Black Prism by Brent Weeks in the other. Unable to decide, I scrolled through the reviews on my phone and still came up with nothing. I picked this book purely because the synopsis sparked my interest more (although the extremely high goodreads rating made me nervous) and I'm so glad that I took a chance on it! 
 Interestingly, the story starts with our protagonist, Kvothe, as a man in about his mid-twenties hiding behind the facade of an innkeeper - a remarkably mundane occupation for such a prolific man. The Chronicler convinces him to share the story of his life so far, of how he came to be a legend. Most of the book is set in the past from Kvothe's point of view and it was clear to me from the beginning that Patrick Rothfuss is a master storyteller. For a start, he is able to characterize both versions of Kvothe (one who is young, intelligent and eager to learn about the world) with the older Kvothe who has to live with the consequences of his actions. This is done believably. There was no discrepancy between his underlying character even though both Kvothes are different based on age and experience. 
 The world in which the story is set is rich and detailed. The writing is superb and beautiful in parts. The magic system is based loosely on science and actually would be quite rational (if it existed). I won't ruin the book for you by delving too much into the plot but it is very varied and Kvothe experiences life in ways such as on the streets and at the university. I think some people were a little disappointed because they were expecting a story where the main character hunts down the Chandrian but this is about Kvothe's life, about how he becomes a legend not a revenge story. Also don't let the slow-ish start put you off. The rest of the book more than makes up for it. 
 I bought the second book before I finished the first so I will be starting it soon. I've fallen in love with that world and the characters and the older Kvothe drops hints for what is to come. I can't wait to see how some of the things he's mentioned actually happen. If you love fantasy and aren't afraid of a larger book, I think you should give this one a try.""",2013-09-04 11:46:50,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 I understand why this book needed to be written and placed when it is - with the revelation of Temeraire's breed, the involvement (and displeasure) of the Chinese was inevitable, and the transport of Temeraire back to China equally so. And yes, the journey from England to China around the Cape of Good Hope is indeed a long one. But in taking a humongous leaf from the 
 Master and Commander 
 series and describing this voyage in painful detail, the action completely stalls (moreso as Temeraire is wounded early on, and is confined to deck for an interminably long portion of the journey). Novik tries to spice it up with some intrigue, but it's all so random, and so much is either never explained or only explained in one blurry rush in the last fifteen pages of the book, that the story becomes not only a chore to read, but a singularly unsatisfying one to finish. 
 Worse, there's a lot I simply don't understand, even after finishing it. If I'm correct in understanding that Temeraire is still somewhere between 6 and 12 months old, and the voyage between China and England takes 6 months... something in the timelines is clearly not matching up. The Chinese must have heard about the egg's theft literally right after it happened in order to make the voyage so quickly, but the distances make that a questionable prospect - and moreover, it's unclear even why they would have heard of such a thing or tried to recover Temeraire in the first place if the true goal (as is revealed late in the story, but only blurrily so) was to ship the dragon off to avoid a conflict for the throne.  
 The voyage ends only extremely late in the book, leaving only a shamefully brief period to explore China and the consequences of full integration of dragons into society as citizens - a fascinating subject, but unfortunately one that is completely overshadowed by the attempts at ""intrigue"" (read: many dull interactions with faceless, similarly-named characters while Laurence and crew are under house arrest, and one final completely random battle which is huge and yet, bizarrely, has no political repercussions whatsoever). And, as mentioned previously, the ending is so rushed as to feel almost nonsensical, truly a deus ex machina in the worst possible sense. For all the focus in this book paid to the supposedly-delicate political and diplomatic situation of the country, for it to end like this is nothing short of completely absurd.

 ***I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This has in no way changed my opinion of the book. The review below is my open and honest opinion.*** 
 So basically I remembered only slivers of The Taking and I couldn't find a recap. I was pretty hesitant to start this since I find that when I remember nothing, I don't enjoy the second book as much, but I was all what the hell, and just went for it. Kimberly Derting does a fantastic job of reminding her reader what went down in the first book. It's not a huge repeat of information. It's just little reminders here and there that worked perfectly to spark my memory. Fantastic job. I wish more second books could offer these hints/reminders. 
 After the devastating cliffhanger of book one, I was eager to learn what was going to happen next. This book is packed full of action. Kyra and her new friends are always on the move, never slowing down. I loved that nothing was easy for them and just when I thought something was too simple, they would be thrown for another loop. These kids had to work hard for what they wanted. 
 I still very much enjoyed all the sci-fi alien stuff. The idea of DNA being altered, and just the whole alien abduction thing plus government conspiracy just completely sucked me in and had me riveted. 
 I also really enjoyed our new characters like Simon, Natty and Willow. Natty felt like a little sister to Kyra even though I feel like they're the same age and Natty may even be older? But I loved her carefree, young, curious personality. Willow is tough as nails and I really liked that about her, but after a certain event happens, she changes and the change didn't feel consistent with her character. 
 Simon. Let's just get this out of the way and let you know about the love triangle that develops here. I felt like it came out of nowhere and was completely unnecessary to the plot. Tyler, Kyra's boyfriend from the first book, isn't really in the picture for this book because reasons that I can't share. So I feel like the love triangle was just thrown in for the sake of this book having some romance. Not cool. However, I really liked Simon. I thought he was a good leader, he was protective and loyal of his people. I didn't like all the secrets he kept, but I did like him. And honestly, I kind of forgot all about Tyler and what made him so awesome. But then I went back and read my review of the first book where I talked about how awesome Tyler was. So now I'm all confused and it's probably all due to this unnecessary love triangle. 
 My other complaint is that some things just didn't make sense. There are certain revelations that happen or plot twists and I just wasn't sure how it all happened. How certain people knew about certain things. Where are they getting their information from? I sincerely hope that a bunch of stuff is explained in the last book because I still feel like there are a lot of unanswered questions. And of course, this book ends on another horrible cliffhanger. I thought it wasn't going to, but then I read the epilogue and was like WTF. So yeah, if you want to avoid the cliffhanger, maybe stay away from the epilogue? Overall, a really exciting, action-packed sci-fi. I can't wait to see how it's all going to end!""",2014-12-28 12:59:30,"The Replaced (The Taking, #2)",young-adult;fiction;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime,Kimberly Derting

 ***I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This has in no way changed my opinion of the book. The review below is my open and honest opinion.*** 
 I read Beth Revis's Across the Universe series before I started blogging and loved it so was really excited when I heard she had a new book. The Body Electric was a very interesting and unique read. I'm not going to lie, some of it was a bit...strange. But I loved unraveling all the mysteries with the main character. 
 The main character, Ella, can enter other people's dreams through a Reverie, technology that her mother developed to help people relive their best memories. Of course, that ability would be coveted by the corrupt government. Naturally, they want Ella to spy for them. 
 I really loved the setting of this book. It takes place on what used to be the island of Malta. Basically the world fell apart, there was a huge war and now there is the largest government that's ever existed in history. If you're confused about any of the world-building, which I really wasn't, but if you are, there are notes in the back of the book that give you a more in-depth look at the world. But anyway, the island was dubbed New Venice and was a layer of cities. There was the Upper City and the Lower City. The Lower City was exactly like Venice with canals and gondolas. The whole city sits right on the Mediterranean and everything just sounded so picturesque. 
 The story itself was really interesting. In true Beth Revis fashion, there's a lot of science. There's talk of androids, cyborgs, cloning, etc. There's a lot of speculation on the human brain and why it's never been successfully cloned. Ella's parents were both genius scientists. I loved all this science-y stuff and my inner nerd was totally cheering. 
 Ella was a great main character. She was brave and determined. I really felt her pain over losing her father and struggling with her mother's disease (her mom is dying). I felt her inner turmoil and she tries to figure out what's going on, who wiped her memories and what it all means. I also enjoyed the romance. Though I didn't really swoon over Jack, I thought it was sweet and I definitely enjoyed his character. 
 All that being said, I think the characters could have been stronger. I think that's the curse of the standalone. I find with standalones that the character development isn't quite as good as it is in series and perhaps this book suffered from that. 
 The ending was also a bit rushed to me. It seemed too easy. Ella just kind of figured everything out and then was able to fix it without even trying. I would have liked it better if she figured it out earlier and then had to work to put everything back into place. I think I really just wanted this book to be a series. At least a duology. 
 But still, it was a thoroughly enjoyable read. If you like science, corrupt governments, creepy hallucinations, and strange boys that you should remember but don't, then you should check this one out. Beth Revis is an amazing author and I can't wait to see what she does next!""",2014-09-12 05:36:52,The Body Electric,young-adult;fiction;romance;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Beth Revis

 Wow. I am so nervous about reading adult fantasy. It's so long and so complex and I worry that I'll either be bored or really confused. But my friend Christopher recommended this book to me and I checked out some reviews on Goodreads and was blown away by the number of 5 star gushing reviews so I decided to give it a try. I am so so glad I did. 
 This is Kvothe's story, told by him. I loved the way this book was written. With Kvothe himself telling his story, it gave it a sense of legitimacy. It was also just beautifully written. The prose is gorgeous and has a musical quality to it, much like Kvothe himself. You see, Kvothe is very musically gifted, among other things. And as you're reading, you can hear it. You can hear his passion for music in the way that he speaks. And I absolutely loved that. 
 Is this book packed full of action? No. This is one of those books that slowly creeps up on you, drawing you so far into the story that you're lost amidst the pages. And then it ends and you shake your head and blink a few times wondering where you are and why the things surrounding you look so ordinary. I was so lost and drawn into this world that Patrick Rothfuss created that I never wanted to leave. I was on the streets of Tarbean with Kvothe fighting for my life. I was at the University with him soaking up the knowledge and struggling to keep my head above water financially. I was in Trebon with him as he performed his first heroic act. I was everywhere, sucked into these pages, lost in the story. 
 Kvothe was a very interesting character. We see him as he is in the present and you can't help but wonder how he got to where he is. Because the young Kvothe he speaks of is nothing like the shell of a man he is now. And I am dying to know what happened. What events led him to this life he lives now as an innkeeper when before he was a bright eyed clever young boy. 
 But I didn't just love Kvothe; I loved all the characters. Bast and Auri especially. I can't wait to learn more about these two in the future. They seem like such good friends to Kvothe. One from his past and one from his future. I loved that even though this is truly Kvothe's story, these characters were still fleshed out and felt real. 
 And don't even get me started on the world-building. Amazing. Incredible. Astounding. Jaw-dropping. Unbelievably inventive. These are just a few words I can use to describe it. This world is so creative and inventive. It holds so many fantasy elements that I love and so many that I desperately want to learn more about in future books. 
 Read this book. If you're a fantasy lover, read it. I don't care if you don't normally read adult fiction. I don't care if the length scares you. I promise that you will not regret it. This is one of those books that will make a deep impact on you. That you will remember for months and years later. A book that will make you question heroism and what it takes to be one. A book that will make you evaluate your own life and your own petty struggles. And a book that will leave you completely breathless and wanting more.""",2014-07-25 07:31:57,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 Oh, how wrong I was. The first few chapters were pretty interesting, but once Superboy (I forget his actual name) starts telling his story, I found myself just slogging through. My issue with this book is ultimately the same problem I had with Ender's Game: the protagonist is so much better than other mortals that it becomes clear quite early in the story that he accomplishes everything he sets out to try. However implausible it may seem, he's just THE BEST at everything he attempts. It's just not good storytelling because it deprives the story of any proper narrative build-up.

1704,29780253,4,"""I received an advanced digital copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. 
 Trevor Noah writes a very absorbing and straightforward memoir that talks about the atrocities of apartheid, what it was like to grow up feeling like you don't belong, and figuring out at a young age that the world is not confined to what you see around you. This could have very easily been a very solemn read but Noah infuses this light-hearted quality throughout all these stories that he recounts in his book. Even the very end when his mother is in the hospital, he and his mother are able to laugh at the horrible things that have happened to them. 
 On that note, Noah's mother is one of the strongest and most resilient people I've ever encountered. Her upbringing truly transformed Noah's perspective on life and you can very clearly see the influence she's had on his life. I really enjoyed reading this memoir because it not only talked about the hardship and obstacles Trevor Noah faced but also brought out his uniquely distinct situation. All the ups and downs in this book made it a very engrossing read.""",2016-11-17 12:26:04,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah
1705,29780253,4,"""A lighthearted and sincere memoir by Trevor Noah, a South African comedian and current host of The Daily Show. In Born a Crime, Noah details his experience growing up in apartheid South Africa, where his parents - a black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father - committed an illegal act just by conceiving him. Throughout this memoir, Noah shares many funny coming-of-age stories, ranging from his awkward first romantic encounters with girls as well as how he once set a neighbor's house on fire. While he maintains a jocular tone throughout the book, he also delves into more serious topics, such as the racism and discrimination he faced and witnessed as a child, the negative effects of colonialism on South Africa, and his mother's abusive second husband. This quote captures the concept of ""the black tax,"" and it features just one slice of how much Noah cherishes and commemorates his mother in Born a Crime: 
 ""So many black families spend all of their time trying to fix the problems of the past. That is the curse of being black and poor, and it is a curse that follows you from generation to generation. My mother calls it 'the black tax.' Because the generations who came before you have been pillaged, rather than being free to use your skills and education to move forward, you lose everything just trying to bring everyone behind you back up to zero. Working for the family in Soweto, my mom had no more freedom than she'd had in Transkei, so she ran away. She ran all the way down to the train station and jumped on a train and disappeared into the city, determined to sleep in public restrooms and rely on the kindness of prostitutes until she could make her own way in the world."" 
 I only have a couple of criticisms of Born a Crime. Its structure felt a bit disorienting, as Noah jumps back and forth in time without any real reason for doing so. This jumbled chronology, while not super appealing, does leave room for another book by Noah, as he does not explore his comedic career in depth. His consistently cheerful tone also did not sit well with me at times. While Noah may just be a generally bubbly and optimistic person - which I respect a lot, considering the hardships he's overcome - there were chapters in which I wanted more introspection, more nuance, and more emotional vulnerability. For example, the last chapter that focused on his mother's abusive relationship moved me, but it felt odd that all of those events got squeezed into one sequence at the end, when they could have been woven in throughout the book. 
 Overall, a great memoir from an important voice in society today. Recommended to fans of Trevor Noah, to those who like coming-of-age stories, and to those who do not mind a lighter memoir with more humor than melancholy. Glad to see so many Goodreads folk getting into this one.""",2016-12-19 20:39:30,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah
1706,186074,3,"""For a book that has a 4.5+ average rating on Goodreads, The Name of the Wind whelmed me. It did not overwhelm or underwhelm me, but as Robin from Young Justice would say, it just kinda whelmed me. 
 Patrick Rothfuss sets up a frame narrative in which Koth, an old innkeeper, destroys some demons in his town. The Chronicler, a guy who goes around recording stories, stumbles upon Koth and learns of Koth's true identity: Kvothe (pronounced like ""Quothe""), notorious wizard and legendary king killer. Kvothe sits down with the Chronicler and tells him of his youth, from when he grew up in a traveling troupe, to when he learned magic and lost his parents, to when he entered a renowned school of magic and made his most prominent allies and enemies. 
 A decent amount of fantasy fans would love this book. Rothfuss infuses his world with an intriguing yet understandable magic system,a variety of people, places, and powers, and a sense of adventure that fills the story after its first 100 pages. Kvothe's coming-of-age felt believable, and his character possessed just the right blend of heroism and bashfulness to inspire empathy. 
 However, Rothfuss got lost in his own narrative at some points. Some of the frame stories within the main frame story felt superfluous, as did certain flowery passes that reeked of purple prose. Perhaps Rothfuss could have tightened some of his physical descriptions and used the leftover space to develop his almost one-sided supporting characters, including Dianne, Bast, and more. 
 Overall, recommended to fans of fantasy, adventure, and coming-of-age stories. While The Name of the Wind lacked in some ways, it established a solid foundation for Kvothe's voice to develop.""",2011-09-04 04:56:23,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
1707,6598461,5,"""My expectations for The Six Rules of Maybe were exorbitantly low after reading The Fortunes of Indigo Skye, also by Deb Caletti. In the latter novel Caletti's writing was insightful but tedious, and her characters were too eccentric without explanation. However, The Six Rules of Maybe was wonderfully written and has a large cast of colorful characters. 
 The book jacket's summary reads something like: this is the story of Scarlet, a nice girl who has trouble fending for herself. When her older sister Juliet returns home with a husband and expecting a baby in the upcoming months, she inwardly curses herself for falling for her sister's husband. Something like that. But this book is about much more then falling in love with someone you shouldn't - it's about the unseen bonds of family, and the courage it takes to change oneself. 
 While the plot meandered a bit and seemed slightly melodramatic at times, by the end of the book I was clinging onto every word. Caletti's prose has improved drastically, and her characters are flawed, fascinating, and unforgettable.

 I am not going to waste my precious time that I could spend dreaming about non existent people to write this review, because this book is not worth it.

 I was really meh about this part, I didn't hate it... yet.

1710,17325147,5,"""The story of girl on a warpath with herself, on road of self destruction. Hilarious and painful. Romance included. 
 This book made me wish I had a Neon Jesus picture in my room; Yes, I was so jealous of that. I stumbled across this book during my holiday and I didn't stop reading until I was done (this was of course achieved with the excessive use of 18 cups of coffee; I was a walking caffeine addict). This book made me cry like a little girl who lost her mummy in the supermarket and laugh so bad that my frozen milkshake (I can't afford ice cream, because I am poor) fell out of my hand and hit a cat. 
 1. First of all, the characters. 
 Blythe might have an odd name; pretty, but odd, but her reality wasn't pretty. I know she was fictional, but she acted like she was real. It made me pretty depressed so I decided to have a COUPLE of drinks (of orange juice) and have drunk conversations with her. I loved how she was so spontaneous and later on tried to live her life to the fullest. She wasn't self conscious and had great comebacks. Original and not-so-boring character = awesome. I liked the fact that she wasn't such a whiny bitch like virgin characters I've seen in other books. 
 Chris didn't really rock my pony. He was okay, but he wasn't anything special like some of those book guys that could easily give you wet dreams. To me he just didn't have IT. Don't get me wrong, he was okay and I am all for ""I will take the blame to save my family"", but he was very ordinary. Maybe I just know too many guys named Chris. 
 Sabin was is a fucking Legend. L-E-G-E-N-D. Ladies and gentlemen, let me kindly and very loudly in Shepherd-family-fashion introduce you to one of the most fabulous characters ever - Sabin. I have no words, he is everything I could ask for in a friend. Funny, confident, and sweet. He has the best comments and my family now thinks I am cray-cray because I laughed too much while staring at my phone. It's all his fault. I love him with all my heart and my ovaries. I really need a Sabin, so if you're out there don't hesitate to show up at my door at 3am with cheap Senor Tequila and strippers. 
 Estelle could be my BFF. She is just hilarious and the whole no-filter thing totally works for her. She was the funniest character of all of them...especially when she told the story about whipping out a vibrator and using it in front of her roommate because she simply didn't like the bitch. It's disturbing - I would totally high five her. Also, the neon Jesus that came as a bonus to Estelle really did make my day, week. 
 So yeah, well fucking done author. 
 2. The very, very, VERY ironic storyline. Did I mention it was ironic? IT WAS IRONIC - just in case you're unaware. 
 So, I have to admit that the goddamn storyline was really odd when it comes to the whole COINCIDENCE. It was painful at times, I was all too tied together to be real, but of course it's a book so it can be a bit unrealistic... A BIT. The end coincidence (which I guessed way before the story properly got a kickoff) was way out of place. The irony in it was just too much and all of it was wayyyy too complicated. It's like when you're making coffee, but instead of doing the simple thing you decide to 1. Grow your own coffee beans, 2.Collect them, 3.Dry them (CBA to do research), 4. Grind them using your hands, 5. Use two stones to ignite a fire and your neighbour's garbage as fuel 6.Go to another country to collect water from a dirty river, 7.Boil water and add those damn grinded beans. But, when it's done you decide to opt for tea instead and you go to your local Starbucks/Costa to buy one. Like I said, fucking complicated. 
 Although, I am being dramatic over it, I've got to give the author kudos here. I mean it's like a freaking conspiracy; she might as well be in the illuminati. It takes some serious brains and probably some good drugs to come up with something so impossible yet so tied together. Pssst, hook me up with your dealer. 
 Overall, the storyline was actually decent. It was original and surprised me at times. It was like having your birthday and you get this huge ass cake, then a stripper jumps out of it, but it's not just any stripper. Oh no. It's Magic Mike (we all know you watched it you dirty, dirty... human, myself included). 
 At times it was predictable, but hello, it's bound to happen. The swearing within the book didn't ruin it, it made it better. I hate those types of people who think it's so horrible to swear in books, but it's perfectly acceptable to have a tragedy like the one in the book. Sort your morals out. 
 3. The tragedy. Dear author, you owe me a million tissue boxes and a therapy session. Like, seriously. 
 I never (mostly never) cry during books, unless I can relate to it. However, this book made me feel like I was in a room filled with onions. Once the dam opened, there was no way of stopping it. On the top of that it also made me feel like an ungrateful bitch as I have my family yet still complain. What happened to Blythe was fucking terrible. What happened to Chris was fucking terrible too. You see the correlation here? It seemed like it was the only thing that bound them, but let me enlighten you. They seemed to be connected in a way that isn't possible to happen in the ""shitty reality"". I wish I could create an effect like the author did. 
 I don't know how I managed to finish this book without having a nervous breakdown. Things that happened in this book, those horrible things that happened to the Shepherds actually happen on a daily basis in some families. I don't mean the exact same things, but let's say not every human is humane. And godamnit if that doesn't make you feel shitty. 
 4. Be my muse, be my inspiration. 
 See the running was a theme in this book. I always wanted to start running and this book made me finally get off my ass and move. I whipped out my trainers, some old t-shirt that could be stained with sweat and blood (and there is blood) and simple sweats. With my headphones secured in my ears and excitement that bubbling through me I took off running. Such a great idea huh? Great for your health and all? No. Nope. Nein. Nulla. JUST NO. Well, I stepped on a sharp stone and cut my foot, ripped my shirt on a branch, got chased by a wild dog with a bad haircut and nearly stepped onto a couple about to get it on. Oh and let's not mention the 6 cars that nearly run me over because I was acting like a holy cow running in the middle of a dirt road. IT'S A DAMN DIRT ROAD WHY IS THERE A BLACK MERCEDES DRIVING ON IT? At one point I thought it was the mafia. 
 So it was like... 
 And then some more.... 
 Despite the story of my failure (story of my life), the book did inspire me. Although the running never worked out in the end I might try it again somewhere else. I am so jealous of Blythe's willpower to do this. It may sound easy, but it takes effort and strength. 
 Just to conclude. This book will make you want to poke out your eyes and use up a month's worth of crying coupons. By the end you are just going to scream like a raging lunatic. It was an awesome story and I really wish there would be another novel telling Sabin's or Estelle's story; it would totally kick ass. 
 Just read it godamnit. Or else.... ;) 
 Just kidding. It's worth your time.

 I'm not a regular Daily Show watcher or anything, but every time I hear Trevor Noah talk, I like what he's saying. I also like how he's saying it. The rhythm of his words and his dry wit are very appealing. But still I went back and forth on whether to read his book, then finally thought, Oh, why not? 
 Why not is no longer a question. The question is: Why are you NOT reading this right now? 
 Because this isn't an autobiography. It's a series of essays about events that shaped him into the man he is, and it's also an illumination of what life was like during and immediately after apartheid. I knew OF apartheid, but I had no idea what a horrifying situation it was. I had no idea what happened after, when people were ""free."" Free to live wherever they wanted, free to marry whomever they wanted. But how could they? With no money, no education, and so many years of oppression? 
 This book was fascinating, and heartbreaking, and funny. It was tragic and beautiful. Trevor himself is a hoot: full of creativity and energy that bursts out in the worst ways (he burned down a house by accident! A WHITE FAMILY'S HOUSE), he was tested as a child to make sure he wasn't a sociopath, or just really ADHD . . . nope, but just full of brains and mischief, essentially. Through it all there is his mother, his mother who purposefully had him with a white man as a form of rebellion. His mother who believed in ""Spare the rod, spoil the child"" but also made sure that he went to the best schools, had the best opportunities in life to do something great. 
 And he did. Even if all he ever did was write this book, I think he's done something great.""",2016-11-29 08:24:30,Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah
1718,17345218,5,"""I'm going to give this five stars, though I didn't think I would until about halfway through. 
 I was upset by the premise of this (if you don't know, it's not a spoiler, it's right there on the cover, but Bridget is now a single mom). After it taking her two books to really get together with Mark Darcy, Mark is gone and Bridget is trying to hold it all together at 51, with two young children, trying to get back into dating and start a career as a screenwriter, which made me feel like she (and I) had been robbed of her happily ever after. Some of the parts about dating websites, and most of her friends still being single and drunk every night, I was like, REALLY!? REALLY!? At your/their age/s? 
 But then I started to see through that. Of course Bridget isn't living like a J. Crew catalogue model in a gracious home with Mark and two perfectly behaved children! Bridget is a real person, and this is a real life she's having. (Okay, she's fictional, this is fiction, but you know what I mean.) 
 In BRIDGET JONES DIARY, I had nothing in common with Bridget. When I first read that book, I was younger than her, married, and I've still never had a drink or a cigarette in my life. But what hooked me was two things: that it was an update (hilariously, wonderfully) of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, and that underneath it all, Bridget felt just as nutty and insecure as I felt. And that's what drew me in here. Now, as a mother, Bridget is more like me than she ever was before. No, I'm not dating a man young enough to be my son. No, I don't have to keep track of how much nicotine gum I chew every day. But I know what it's like to run in, late and sweaty, for school concerts, and discover that your shirt is rucked up and or your underwear is showing. I have been late every day for picking up my preschooler, and then had the teacher send out a general email saying ""some mothers must be confused about pick up time."" I've had sick kids and still gone out to the movies or gotten a massage and then felt guilty all day the next day. I've sent the kids out with a babysitter so that I could work on a book, and then spent the entire day shopping online for clothes that I don't end up purchasing because the models make me feel fat, and then ""gotten revenge"" on J. Crew by binge eating. Right now, I'm having to learn to say No to a lot of things, and take a break, because I can't hold it all together, and be a mother, and look perfect, and write wonderful books, and when Bridget goes through that, I found myself laugh-crying (at the gym, on a recumbent bike). This is the perfect finish to Bridget's story, frankly. I kind of hope she doesn't do any more. If you haven't read BRIDGET JONES' DIARY, please do yourself a favor and read it!

 BRENNUS 
 Me eyes open ta a high ceiling above; exposed stone beams hold up a barrel-vaulted ceiling, shedding its discolored, crumbling plaster. Light from several half-boarded-over windows dispels da shadows from da room. I bring me hand ta da bridge of me nose, pinching it in an attempt ta ease da ache dere. I feel as if I've slept in da arms of an aingeal, only ta awake in Hell. Me head spins around as me blood jumps tru me. I'm na accustomed ta dat--me blood flowing freely in me veins--liquid and on fire. Me heart does na pump it; it still lies dormant in me chest. Nevertheless, blood is circulating tru out me body now, making me stronger dan ever before. 'Tis just one of da ways I'm different since Genevieve changed me. 
 Rising upon me elbow, it sinks inta da soft mattress. One corner of da clean, linen sheet comes untucked. I ignore it. I wait until da pressure in my head eases, and den I drop me hand ta see Finn eyeing me from his poppy-colored, winged chair in a corner of da spacious bedroom. Finn had located dis defunct seminary in a falling-down part of Detroit--Genevieve's city. 
 ""Any problems?"" I ask Finn, wondering why he's here in me bedroom. 
 ""Plenty, but none pressing,"" he replies, shooting out da white cuffs of his dress shirt from beneath his black suit jacket before smoothing his dark sleeve. 
 ""How far are we wi' da move?"" 
 He smiles. ""Farther dan expected--'tis a sound location--easier ta keep hidden dan our place in Ireland."" I nod. Da six-story Norman Gothic Revival building Finn found for us is spacious, constructed of brown ledge stone. Me room is on the top floor of a corner turret that's capped wi' a pointed, copper roof. Finn chose the location because it has several attached building in da same style. They encompass a few city blocks. At da same time, the structures affords us a great deal of privacy in dis abandoned neighborhood. 
 ""Any complaints?"" I ask. 
 ""Truth be told, dere were a few,"" Finn says with a barely suppressed grin. 
 ""Eh?"" I respond with a raise of me eyebrow. 
 Finn's eyes twinkle. ""Some o' da neighbors took offense at da paleness of me flesh."" 
 Both of me eyebrows rise now. ""Whah did ye say ta dat?"" I smirk despite me aching head. 
 Wi' a cheeky grin, he replies, ""I told dem 'tis difficult ta get a tan when one's undead."" 
 ""How did dey take it?"" 
 ""Och, Brady ate dem before dey could respond. He was leppin' wi' da hunger."" 
 I shake me head slowly. ""Anyting else?"" 
 ""I put Comgan in charge of da renovations. Da roof is sound, jus missing a wee bit o' da slate. In all, 'twas a grand structure at one time: now 'tis a skeleton whose flesh has been ravished by poverty. Dermot has layered spells over da location. I had Erskine aid him. No craitur should be able ta detect our presence here. Since we bought da property straight out, na even da humans will bother us."" 
 I rub me eyes and nod. ""Dat's good, Finn."" 
 Finn studies me before he asks, ""Do ye need anyting, Brenn? Is dere someting I can do for ye?"" 
 ""How long have I been gone?"" I ask. 
 ""Asleep? Na long,"" he responds. ""A few hours."" He leans back in his seat. His calm, regal eyes are missing nuting. 
 ""Ye've been here da whole time?"" I ask, raising me eyebrow. 
 ""I have,"" he nods as if he hasn't had anyting better ta do. His black hair falls forward onto his brow. 
 ""I can take care of meself, Finn,"" I mutter, trying ta clear me head. 
 ""Even so."" Finn shrugs, na at all put off. 
 ""Ye plannin' ta guard me forever, brudder?"" I ask. 
 ""If need be."" 
 ""Ye worried one of da fellas will try ta kill me in me sleep?"" 
 ""Ye do smell delicious--very much like Genevieve at da moment--ye may want ta go and wash off her scent before someone determines ta make ye his queen. And ta yer point, ye resemble such a peaceful craitur when ye're nappin'. 'Tis a wonder I do na end ye meself,"" he says with a grin. His green eyes, so reminiscent of our family's, glow wi' humor. Dere's na a bit o' malice in his voice, jus mirth. In truth, he'd protect me at his own peril, and I'd protect him at moin. 
 ""So ye plan ta be around whenever I close me eyes?"" 
 ""Ye sleep too deeply. Ye're like a wan,"" he says critically. 
 ""Ye try sleepin' lightly after all of dese centuries wi'out--'tis no easy task."" 
 ""Ye're too auld, Brenn"" he teases me. 
 ""I might be at dat."" 
 ""Will ye speak of Genevieve or no? I've a care ta know how our queen fairs."" 
 ""She's grand."" 
 ""Is she now?"" 
 ""Da divine aingeals have her in a wintery, mountain enclave--'tis very Palladian--ye'd approve."" 
 ""So Emil hasn't taken her?"" 
 ""Na for da moment."" 
 ""Shall we go and collect her den?"" Finn asks, but he seems in no hurry ta move from where he is. 
 ""Dere's more ta it. Atwater is dere wi' her,"" I say. Finn's demeanor changes as if I had told him dat a fella had touched his Molly. Quick as a click, he's on his feet by me side wi' a killer-shine is his eyes. 
 ""Ye're sure 'twas him?"" 
 ""I did na see him wi' me own eyes. Genevieve told me he sought her out."" 
 Finn's knuckles stand out on his fists, ready ta be bloodied. ""Whah does da bugger want wi' Genevieve? Does he have a plan for her as well?"" 
 ""He's an aingeal. Dey all have plans, one way or da other,"" I say.

1729,5099602,3,"""The first thing to say about this book is that it was not what I expected at all, and not in a good way. 
 When I read the summary and reviews I expected something like Hunger games but with a lot of fighting, a complicated plot and a little romance but what I got was completely different. 
 The plot was anything but complicated. Actually, it was one of the simplest plots I have ever read, and this is just personal opinion but for me or anyone else like me who has a thirst for complicated plots and twists, this was not good. Though a lot of people might find it refreshing. 
 One weird thing about was that some parts of the story were described with a lot of details like the travels in the first half of the book so based on that you would expect a lot of waiting and investigating when they finally did reach Monsea. But then in two pages suddenly they met the king , he killed her wife and they ran. It was shocking, and then from there the second half of the book began and the change was so sudden it made my head spin for a while. I'm not saying this as a bad point for the book it was actually interesting, if not exactly fun. 
 The first half was filled with romance , friendship, and travel completely, with very little -next to no- action. I can't remember a fantasy book with this quality and I was really surprised. Even the romance wasn't the heart breaking, hot and a bit unbelievable romance it usually is in fantasy books, it was a slow, more realistic romance that took form from friendship. 
 However, instead of being warm and believable, for me, it mostly felt a bit like an educational book about relationships between man and women that got turned into a novel to be more interesting -and failed- 
 and always at the moments that there was finally some heat a little comment was made that sort of ruined the entire mood, so it wasn't the kind of romance that you would die for, and it was more realistic and therefor less exiting. 
 The second half was also very different from any other fantasy books I've encountered. It had more action than the first half but only slightly. It was filled with more travel and trying to survive nature and some heartbreaking moments. 
 So unlike what the cover and the synopsis suggest this book had surprisingly little action , fight or magic. 
 I found it a bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I like romance and I like books with no action. I like twilight and I could handle selection, but this book had a lot of wasted potential. The idea was great and Katsa is a kickass heroine -I like seeing a heroine who knows methods of birth control- and it could've easily been something like Mistborn or at least The Hunger Games and it was disappointing that with so much potential for amazing fights, interesting graces , complicated stories and likable characters the book was instead filled with romance and ideas of marriage and relationships. 
 The idea of graces and different eye colors is very interesting but unfortunately there was very little explanation about it in the book and honestly after a while, you could just easily forget it since it didn't have that much of an effect on the story. Katsa could just easily be a great fighter with good instincts and Po a handsome boy with a lot of muscles. 
 Speaking of him, one of the best points of this book was Po (even though the name was a bit upsetting, can you imagine yourself falling in love with a Po?) He was a great love interest. charming , cocky , strong and sweet. He was the only thing that gave the romance a bit of color and passion. 
 The ending was like the rest of the book, with very very little action, (just a dagger actually), realistic events and a bit of disappointment. 
 Also, the pace of the story was not right, there was so much time and focus on not important and not interesting moments and then the exiting parts in comparison were very small and fast. Some decisions took ages to be made and some were made too quickly to be believable.I think Katsa took more time to think about what to hunt for dinner than to make a decision about defying the king or leaving the court with Po. 
 Also, somethings were just thrown in the book and then there was no explanation for them. For example, at the start of the book it was clear that Katsa has a particuler dislike and hatred for mind readers, she was ready to hurt an innocent little girl just because she might have had the ability to read her mind and she didn't like the person in Randa's court because he/she - I don't remember!- could sense emotions. But then there was no explanation given on why she had such a hatred for them, and she trusted Po way too easy considering this fact. 
 It is clear from the review that this book is not one of my favorites. maybe the reason I was so disappointed was because I had such high hopes for it. Overall, except the little mentions of graces and eyes, the fantasy part of the book lacked originality, while the romance part lacked passion. The plot was simple with no complications and no surprises. There were some very touching and heart breaking moments but they were rare in the whole book.""",2013-05-16 01:34:49,"Graceling (Graceling Realm, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;romance;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Kristin Cashore

 This is one of THOSE books. If you have read fantasy enough, you know what i'm talking about. 
 There are countless fantasy books in the world, most of them worth reading. When you read fantasy enough, there are a few bad ones, a lot of good ones and a ton of great ones.

 The thing is no matter how much you love most books they still fade away from your memory. You re-read some. You dream about some for a while and maybe even obsess over some, but they will eventually fade. 
 Then there are THOSE books. There are some famous ones like lord of the rings and harry potter and then there are the personal ones, every fantasy reader should remember a few. 
 They are the books that make you want to cry out of the sheer amazingness of them. The ones that make you blush . The first one that comes to mind when you think of the world brilliant.

 Protect the Diamonds 
 This talks about the abusive father, the one who rapes his wife and daughter. I think it also pertains to Sophie and the old woman. He protected them all, tok care of them. It was his first ""mission"". 
 Survive the Clubs 
 This one is about Gavin, and his brother. If I remember correctly there were fighting a lot, and it was getting really intense. Ed, the main character, had to be beaten up for the brothers to realize that, well, they are brothers. 
 Dig Deep Through The Spades 
 It started off with the poems, the authors, and the funny incident in the library. This part was the least interesting for me. All I got from reading this part was well, sometimes you have to exert effort if you really want to get what you want. 
 Feel the Hearts 
 This part was really good, wow. First, with Richie. Richie is my favorite character next to Ed, so a part of the novel that talked about him a lot made me happy. His problem was slightly less severe then Marvs, but a lot more than Audrey's. He needed to want something, he had no ambitions in life, and Ed helped him through that. 
 Marvs on the other hand, had a huge problem. He has a son. That had to be the second biggest shock of the novel for me. I didn't expect it, although I had no idea what his problem was before the revelation. I couldn't even guess, cause for me nothing really bad was going on with him aside from the ugly old car. 
 Audrey didn't strike me as attractive. That reason alone lead me to be less concerned of her during the third part of the ""hearts"". And it's crazy that she loves him yet she wants someone else. 
 The Joker 
 The biggest shock or plot twist of the novel! I thought that after the hearts it would be all over, but clearly the author intended to shock everyone with that ending. I was leaning towards the idea of his father planing the whole charade and all, but no. I also thought that maybe it was the bank robber himself, but no, he was just an accessory to it all. They didn't reveal who the man was, and Ed didn't even know who he was, so I guess I didn't really hate on the author for not telling us who he was. 
 The moral of the novel though is clearly amazing. 
 And I quote from the novel, 
 ""If a guy like you can stand up and do what you did, then maybe everyone can. Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of."" 
 It is true though, ordinary people deem to be the most helpful in society. And if no one wants to stand up, then what will happen to the world? Someone must, and will be brave enough to speak up and do something about a certain problem in society perhaps. 
 ""I'm not the messenger at all. 
 I'm the message."" 
 He thought that he was just the messenger, delivering messages to the people ""in need"", but clearly he was something more. I understood this as Ed being an inspiration to all. To man up and deal with problems. If one decides to be a coward, then one will never succeed in life. That person will never get what he wants, or even worse, what he deserves. 
 This may be written for Young-Adults, but clearly the message of the novel applies to all. When a person has a huge problem in life, sometimes they just need someone to help them realize that being a coward wouldn't help at all, or if they don't need someone, then they need the hear the message from somewhere, because once the person realizes that he could do something about it, all he needs it motivation to actually pursue the elimination of that problem. 
  
 The novel for me had a slow start, but clearly everything else made up for it. I've heard that most people stopped from the part where I almost did, but I'm really glad I didn't. This novel was truly good, and I might need to read this again soon, just to relive that amazing plot. Might I add that this novel is fairly original for me. I haven't read anything like this before, and that ending really is the best. I can't say that it was an easy four stars, considering I almost gave it just one, but bear with the first few chapters and you will not regret it.""",2014-04-23 08:13:56,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak

1737,12077902,5,"""I listened to the Bill Johnston's 2011 translation of Solaris because one of my goodreads friends had pointed out an article to me that stated that the old translation was rather poor in comparison. Neither one of us knows enough Polish to check if this is true or not, but I can at least say that this is the first Stanislaw Lem novel that I really like. I had read two others before, and found both a rather heavy read. It was especially true with one of them. When I finished listening to Solaris I started to wonder if that might have had something to do with the translations of those books, but I can't say. 
 Solaris is in some sense a simple story. Some have said it is an version of the well known haunted house story line. A few people trapped in a house (this time a space station) are constantly plagued by ghosts (in this case alien entity), but I think that is simplifying matters too much. Lem manages to create a really alien being, or entity, or what ever one wants to call the ocean in Solaris. And he describes the ocean in such vivid details, the way it moves and behaves, that it feels real, even though I never fully get what it is. It is not human, it is alien. 
 True to the haunted house story line there are only a few characters in this ""house,"" but they are always an interesting group. Their fear, paranoia, sense of loss, and even their curiosity keeps this moving. I mean, this is not an action story. There are no great battles to fight with highly imaginative weapons, but even without all that sort of thing there is a lot happening. The battles in this story are fought on other levels, but they are fought just the same. 
 So all I can really say is that I find this book fascinating, and that is the first time I can really say that about Stanislaw Lem novel, but it mean I think I will have to read some more of his work. Just like to add one more thing, Alessandro Juliani reads this very well.""",2014-05-26 06:32:10,Solaris: The Definitive Edition,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime,Stanislaw Lem;Bill Johnston;Alessandro Juliani

He should really change his passwords once in a while. Anyway, I was underwhelmed, since I'd already read the other one and had heard that John Green tends to be rather repetitive in his work. 
 I was wrong. Remind me never to mistrust the Boy again. 
 The Fault in Our Stars was odd. I enjoyed it greatly, but while enjoying it I could recognize its faults and its efficient-but-annoying ability to push emotional buttons. I was embarassed of my enjoyment. 
 Not the case with Paper Towns. It's much more natural, much more honest. Where whatshername and whatshisname are too purposely intelligent and witty ALL THE TIME, Quentin and his friends are occasionally dumb, scared and confused. And while the story itself is bordering on the unlikely, the characters are entirely believable and relatable. They react exactly how I would act and worry and dream about the same things I still worry and dream about, despite my flimsy pretence of adulthood.

 UPDATE 
 If I could, I would break the rating scale to give Undivided the score it truly deserves. This series, the Unwind series is one of my top 5 favorite series of all time. It is truly fantastic! 
 If you haven't read the other books in this series (Unwind, Unwholly, and Unsouled), I suggest that you start now. 
 The basic premise for this series is that three teenagers are marked for unwinding (a sort of forced organ donation) by their families, and they struggle to escape from the cops and survive. (Click for more).This series puts other Dystopian books to shame. 
 My Review: 
 Many of you may already know this, but I absolutely adore Neal Shusterman's writing style. I tend to be blown away by his books' greatness, and Undivided was no exception. 
 The plot of this book was nonstop action and excitement. Quite a few times, I had to put my copy down and walk away just so that I didn't have a heart attack or something, but I never could keep away for long! I read Undivided in a single day. 
 It was the perfect conclusion to the Unwind series. I had a lot of thoughts on how Shusterman would manage to end this series, but they all fell miles from the actual ending. I was completely shocked by many points of this story. From time to time, I would literally gasp while reading and say, ""The author can't do that! Can he?"", and, for better or worse (definitely better), he could and he did. 
 The characters, as they were in the rest of the series, were perfectly flawed. We have characters like Connor, a martyr who never wanted control who becomes our hero, and Grace, a girl with a mental handicap (low-cortial) who is a brilliant statistician. Even the characters who I started out hated like Cam ended up beings wonderful surprises. 
 I'm not going to give anything away, but you will love it once you read it!

I'm not a picky book reader, just as long as the books gives me emotions whether to cry or to laugh or whatever it is. It is pretty much an automatic favorite of mines. And this book did exactly that. 
 I gave this book a 5 stars, but in reality I would've given it more of a 4.5 stars. Even though there was drama with Ghost, to me there wasn't as much drama there is unlike the first one. It's a fictional love story and even though it was predictable, I wish that she added more drama to the story.Like the guy who hit her, I wish there was more drama there than just having Ghost threaten him and that's it. 
 Ghost's story was devastating and my heart broke a million pieces for his childhood. But that was pretty much the drama of the whole book.

1742,676924,3,"""** spoiler alert ** 
 The book Vampire Academy completely captured my heart and I couldn't like any other book much more, but I gave this book a try. 
 I started the book with a feeling I won't like it. Why? 
 The title was 'Betrayed'- and after reading ""Shadow Kiss"", I'm not sure I could handle something that would hurt- especially when I am deeply attached with a character. 
 When I finished reading this book, I was left wanting for more. 
 What I like about how the author wrote this book is she makes the characters sound very cool. 
 What I mean is: A character with affinity for all 5 elements and adult vampyre marks- could the protagonist be any more cooler? 
 Though despite the cool-ess, there is imperfection. Where there is imperfection, characters sound more real- which is a good thing, of course. But she's just kinda... I dunno, too good to be true? She's a little too perfect-- her powers, I mean. 
 Although in general, I like this book, I was very annoyed with Zoey. 
 Liking 3 guys at once- whoa, that was even worse than Bella in Eclipse. And oh yeah, the constant repetition of ""hag"" ""bitch"" and ""slut"" kinda gets to my nerves. I just don't really like it when words are repeated every so often. 
 This was the book that destroyed all you ever knew and believed about the book. It was one heck of a ride- No, more than that, this was the book that changed everything. And when I say 'changed', I mean it. 
 Aphrodite not being truly evil, Neferet being evil, Zoey liking Heath and her teacher which roughly translates to Zoey not sure whether she loved Erik more than anyone else. Stevie Rae gone. 
 I hated everything that happened... And yet these changes were good. The plot twists improved. I could almost guess it was Neferet who did all the bad things, but what I didn't get was why. How. 
 I hate it when a book ends with questions, especially when you have to wait a year for it and you just have to know or you'd die. In my case, I didn't have to do any waiting at all, but still. Book endings matter, whether the waiting is 1 year or merely 1 hour. 
 A good book. But man, Vampire Academy couldn't get out of my mind.""",2009-03-05 01:51:38,"Betrayed (House of Night, #2)",romance;fiction;young-adult;fantasy;paranormal,P.C. Cast;Kristin Cast

 Arithon S'Ffalenn and Lysaer S'Ilessid are princes of two kingdoms which have been at war for centuries. They are also half-brothers on their mother's side, and each have a gift of elemental magic through her. Lysaer recieved no training in his powers of light and was simply raised a noble of Amroth, Arithon was schooled in his shadow powers before returning to claim heirship to the pirate kingdom of Karthan. 
 When Arithon is captured in battle, the S'Ilessid king decrees his fate to be exile through the worldsend gate. The half-brothers mother has pronounced that whatever the sentence the brothers must share the same fate. And so both Arithon and Lysaer are sent through the portal together. To another world where they are both royal heirs prophecied to destroy the evil mistraith and bring sunlight back to the land. 
 I started this book once before, and abandoned it not quite half way. This time I was determined to make it all the way through, and find out what all the fuss was actually about. In the end I'm not truly sure if it was worth the effort. The book feels extremely slow paced, and while the writing is of a high standard it's often so complex and flowery as to require regular re-reading of entire paragraphs to fully understand whats going on. The first 300 pages were quite a slog to get through, and it wasn't until the second half of the book that I actually felt the plot get moving. 
 I think the main cause of the book's slowness is it's reliance on prophecy. It's almost as if the author decided on a nice tragic plot for her novel, and then tried to force it into play by having one of her mages prophecy it, and then having everyone else repeat it over and over until it became true. Whilst this might work for some people, I really rather prefer a character driven plot, and I prefer my prophecies to remain cryptic and forgettable until the final plot-twist. 
 Another problem I had with the novel was the characters themselves. Arithon and Lysaer being the main characters are obviously the most detailed, and yet they still seemed flat. I believe this is because the author was constantly describing them in terms of their heritage, and not building them as characters in their own rights. There were numerous references to s'Ffalen empathic traits and s'Ilessid sense of justice, but it simply made the characters feel as if they were racial stereotypes rather than people. Granted I did feel like I knew them a little better towards the end of the novel, but thats a very long time to wait. And lesser characters like 'Elaira' were seriously overlooked, we're plastered with indications that she is to be extremely important in the plot, and yet she is barely involved. Even so I felt she was a more real character than either of the brothers, given that all her characterisation came from her actions and not discriptions of her birthright. 
 Wurts has obviously planned the novel as part of a much larger scale story (there are now 11 books in the series), but that leaves much of this novel hanging and unresolved waiting for the next installment. Granted thats always a feature of series work, but it felt that there was just simply not enough plot in this novel to make an enjoyable book. Or maybe it was just that the plot was spread so thinly over 800 pages. 
 In conclusion, I found the novel mildly enjoyable, but not worth the time and effort spent. I probably won't be seeking out the rest of the books unless I find myself in a real drought of reading material.""",2009-03-09 11:38:43,"The Curse of the Mistwraith (Wars of Light and Shadow, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction,Janny Wurts
1745,22041202,4,"""Previously reviewed at 
 This book is intended for an 18+ audience. 
 A copy of this book was provided by the author for an honest review - however I already owned a copy of it....the review will still be honest though! 
 Every now and then I come across a book that I find really difficult to rate and this is one of them. It took me a lot of pondering to decide on a 4 heart review, and I will explain my reasoning for it. 
 You may, or may not know, that very often I don't look at a book's blurb - while I can stay away from handbags and shoes, and happily live in supermarket clothes, I am a compulsive book buyer (notices the nods, you too huh!), well, this was one of those books. The cover is PRETTY, the hype on FB etc good, I had no idea what it was about and purchased it. Then a request came in to the blog and, as I already had it, I thought why not, I'll review it - but I still hadn't a clue what the book was about. In fact I only discovered what the book was about as I was reading it. 
 This book is a mish-mash of romance and erotica and I'm not sure which bit dominates. I'm not against a bit of BDSM in my novels but it certainly isn't the staple of my literary diet. This has BDSM, menage (M/M/F & M/M/M). Now, I'm a romance girl through and through. For some reason I found the M/M/F scene harder to read...maybe I'm just to used to reading about the men at the moment, maybe I have deep-set psychological issues. Who knows. That isn't to say though, that the scene wasn't well written, it was, as were the M/M/M scenes. I think perhaps I have to be in a certain mood for the more erotic end of the romance scale and trying to read it in the holidays with the children asking questions every couple of minutes isn't really the way to set that mood. So I guess that's a convoluted way of saying it wasn't really what I was looking for to read at this moment in time. However it was very well written so I shan't knock of any marks for my own personal hormonal response. 
 The romance though, well that was something that I could get on board with. That first moment between Aiden and Dario, hells bells, now to me, that right there is SUPER hot. I adored the way we saw them fall in love through the obstacles and difficulties. And they really did fall in love. Krylov's writing style is very unique to her, it took me a few pages to get into it but once I did I thoroughly enjoyed the first person narrative, the long poetic sentences and I felt as though I understood Aiden completely. We saw Dario through Aiden's eyes, with Aiden's insecurities, but it was still very easy to understand him as a person, I very much liked both MC's. 
 I found the traumatic event in Dario's past hard, I also found the way he dealt with it hard. That is not just an issue with this book, it's something I've found in other stories of the same nature. Just because I have difficulty understanding the way he deals with his trauma doesn't mean that I think it was written badly or dealt with wrongly. I think when we empathise with characters in books it's often because we recognise our own traits/thoughts in them. In this case Dario is very opposite to me but I could empathise with him because the character was so clear - I just couldn't understand it on a personal level. 
 I think my thoughts on this really are, Varian Krylov is a wonderful writer and I love her writing style - her content though is not my preferred read. It's definitely a case of it's not you, it's me. I will say, if you have any potential triggers, please read the warnings before you choose this book. If BDSM, menage & romance are your things, then this book really could be for you.""",2014-05-20 05:10:22,Dangerously Happy,romance;fiction,Varian Krylov

Ohhhh yeah...that other definition of geek. And in fact, I enjoyed it much more than MIS, but in the world of Goodreads stars, I guess I only think of it as one notch above. It was good enough. The writing was almost where I wanted it to be in relating the extravagant world of carnies--it was descriptive enough, although there were times I wouldn't have minded being completely devoured by sensory overload (which I wouldn't think is too hard to do with this subject matter). I loved the whole notion of deciding what makes a freak and what makes a norm. I often found myself wondering whether I loved or despised Oly...mainly finding the differences relied on whether it was the present (+) or the past (-) (side note--she seems a lot like Claw-claw-Claudius a la I, Claudius during her youth; anyone else think so?).

1749,186074,5,"""Well, I've recovered. 
 I read a little of this book the first day I got it. Only got about a hundred pages thought it before I was content to do something else. It was a slow beginning and slow beginnings tend to make me set aside a book and pick it up occasionally. Well, I didn't have occassion to pick it up again until yesterday. Got through another little boring section and then something happened. Something that was written so well that I couldn't hardly put the book down last night. I woke up early cause I couldn't sleep and I needed to read it. So what does this mean? The character went through something that completely pulled me into his life. Nothing that followed, no matter how boring or mundane, could pull me out of the story after that. 
 There are no spoilers in this review. I will simply say that there will be those who connect with Mr. Rothfuss' writing and are drawn into this story. There will be those who cry, such as myself, because of the way he writes tragedies. On the other hand, there will be those who don't like the writing or 'flashback' type feel of the book or the rather slow parts. I loved it. I loved the hints you got from Mr. Rothfuss when he hopped to current times. They gave me little tastes of what was to come and it made me read on, curious at times, dying at others. As for the slowness, yes it is. However, once that major moment happened for me, I rather enjoyed the slow parts. 
 There's something very quiet about Kvothe that draws me to him, while there's other traits that make me frown. But I still adore him. I'm a character reader who only tends to give five stars when a character suffers so much in their life and somehow pushes through it. Kvothe is that character for me. I loved him. And I loved this book.

 This book was really good. You'll note that I say ""really good,"" but not THE BEST THING EVER EVER like many people do about this book, so let me be clear: I think that this book is entertaining and thoughtful. I think that the characters and world are very well-developed. It lacked, however, that extra something that makes me give a book five stars. It was easy for me to stop reading and I didn't think about it for a long time after finishing. This book is great in a lot of ways, but not extraordinarily exceptional to me. 
 This book is a story within a story. In it, a man named Kvothe who has become a legend tells the story of his life up to approximately 16. It covers the first of three days (each day is a book) that he requires to tell the story of his life thus far and it's really good. 
 SPOILERSSSSSSSSSSSSSS DISCUSSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 So this may be a weird place to start, but I keep a collection of quotes that I MAY want to get tattooed at some point and there were two quotes from this book which is practically unheard of for me. They are: ""More books than I can read? Somehow I doubted that."" and ""She isn't seen as beautiful. She is beautiful, seen."" (That whole paragraph is just the best. Wow.) 
 I found Kvothe to be a super interesting main character and I also loved his narrative voice. Like, he led a super interesting life, obviously, but the way that he tells the story of it, as someone who has had the benefit of time to look back on it, is really great. All of the comments about what he did right or wrong and why it was right or wrong... all of it was just great. And the foreshadowing was CRAZY!!! I analyzed every little comment older-Kvothe said to guess what would happen to younger-Kvothe. 
 I liked younger-Kvothe. I mean, I liked both, but I feel like the Kvothe that we're learning about has so much growing to do, it's lovely to read about it. I mean, even the smallest things like that he has no clue how to read women who he is interested in but he can also break into the super-secret Archives... it's intriguing. I also love his dedication and his love for learning and his inability to not rise to a challenge and his total disregard for rules. Additionally, I find his love of revenge, while off-putting, essential to his identity. Overall, he's a really great protagonist. 
 I'm not entirely buying the Denna plot-line. I get overtired overquickly of the manic pixie dream girl thing, I get that points are trying to be made and that's how girls will appear to guys, but it's just annoying. I've found (unscientifically and possibly falsely) that most books set in the point of view of a girl make her sky, nerdy, and unpopular while most books set in the POV of a guy have a MPDG. THIS IS FRUSTRATING!! BOTH OF THOSE TYPES OF PEOPLE, AND MORE, EXIST SO WRITE ABOUT THEM PLEASE!! MPDGs piss me off way more, though, so Denna just made me angry. I get it, she's a heartbreaker who you will never be able to understand and is always moving and yadda yadda, but I want WAY more from that element of the story. There is a depth to most characters in this book, I see Denna featuring even more prominently as we continue, so let's give her the same curtosy (and no, ""she was hurt in the past and therefore covers it up by moving around and not letting anyone truly know her or love her and she doesn't let herself love anyone because she can't get hurt again"" is NOT the depth I'm looking for.) 
 She can be a badass though. I'll give her that. 
 So, what's up with that ending with Bast? He wants Kvothe to go back to how he used to be, fighting and being a hero and all that? I guess I get it, he thinks that's how Kvothe is going to be happiest, but I also think there was a sliiiiiight overreaction with all the threatening. 
 His childhood was awesome. The whole thing. Everything about traveling around and about the history of his... people, I guess, would be the term and about all of the preforming and everything that he learned about life and how to know people and learn and UGH SO GOOD!! And then all of his learning with Ben, which was incredibly. His parents were cute too (and reminded me of my parents) and I love that they were so in love and that's the example of love and commitment that Kvothe has going forward. 
 AMBROSE MAKES ME WANT TO HIT ALL OF THE THINGS!!! Ineqality is something that I absolutely despise, as well as unfairness, and everything that Ambrose did to Kvothe in this just... IT MADE ME SO FURIOUS!! It was so unfair and he manipulated everything and ARGH I HATE HIM SO MUCH!!! And we know that he's going to get Kvothe kicked out of the University, which is just infuriating. Basically, I hate him. 
 I thought that the lute playing and the pipes and all was really cool. Definitely a great little element and I love how good he is at it and that he has this place where he can disappear to when necessary and it's just great. And I love that he's good enough to earn his pipes and all that... So great. 
 I was hyperaware of all the money in this book. He's so poor and the way that it's written made me constantly like, ""NO! He shouldn't be spending money on that!"" (When Ambrose made him give him a talent. SO MUCH ANGER AOSIGNEOGIHALOI!!!!!!!!) I was fully enveloped in all parts of the story, but that was a part where I was hyperaware. 
 I love Auri. I like that we had this kind of secretive and shy and maybe not-100%-there character that was actually important. Like, if Kvothe had not been kind to her and helped her out she definitely wouldn't've helped him find his way into the Archives. That's an important lesson. 
 The whole dragon scene was cool. And Denna on that drug was kind of hilarious. It was all just totally brilliant. 
 I love Kvothe's friends. Talk about awesome and supportive and hilarious. 
 The world-building is just crazy good. I'm not even sure if that actually needs saying, but it's just so completely brilliant. SO GOOD!!! 
 Overall, this book has everything I SHOULD want in a book, but lacks a little oomph to take one step further. 
 FFFFFFIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 FAKE fiances? 
 The Max we met in Working It is much too level headed to do something so bizarre. Isn't he? 
 Apparently not when it comes to rich boy, semi-celeb Grady. 
 I loved it. I loved getting to know both of these men. Loved watching them fall for each other. It's a low angst, engaging story. It never slowed down or faltered. Although the characters from the previous book appear, this one can be read as a stand alone since it focuses solely on the new relationship between Max and Grady. I'm impressed with Christine d'Abo's writing.

1758,23364895,5,"""Absolutely BEAUTIFUL! I remember when I started reading the previous one, I didn't like Tyler, well, no wonder! He dumps Alec ""without a second thought"". Yet as the story continue and we learn more about Tyler his reasons turn out to be different from what you'd expect and from that point I REALLY wanted to hear his story and see how he find his HEA. 
 Nearing the ending of the previous one, Alec Ty and Noah talk about a fund raiser for Alec and Ty's clinic, I can't remember WHY Memphis who is a famous stuntman got elected as the best possibility for the commercial they have in mind (Noah had something to do with it FOR SURE). Tyler sounds very reluctant to go and speak with him though we don't really know why.. 
 As this book begins, Memphis has already agreed on appearing in the commercial so the reason Tyler has for visiting him is totally different. When they meet for the first time after 10 years, Tyler doesn't know what to expect, neither from Memphis nor from himself. 10 years ago Memphis packed his staff and left without a word, changing his mobile phone and making himself unreachable for Tyler without him even knowing why, what brought this, is it something that he did? or didn't do? and finding out later on that Memphis got married to a WOMAN also didn't make things easier on him (he DID get recently divorced though..). Memphis was his whole world back then, helped him deal with a lot of shit when no one else was around and him leaving him devastated him. 
 First thing Memphis does though, is hug Tyler with warmth. Though he had his reasons for leaving he missed Tyler and with the fund raiser he hoped he would have a chance to maybe get his friend back, even if it's not possible to re-kindle what they had back in college. Memphis is determined to make Tyler forgive him, he wants to confess the truth to him and finally somehow make it right. Though he doesn't regret his reasoning he does regret missing Tyler all those years and now is the right time to put everything where it SHOULD be. 
 Tyler and Memphis together or rather side by side is sex waiting to happen but while Memphis is ALL FOR IT, Tyler is more reserved about it. He made enough mistakes in former relationships to be wary of jumping in bed with his ex. He actually made a promise to himself to NEVER do that again even if Memphis is driving the ""Ice Man"" (Tyler) bat shit crazy with his sexy smile, too sexy body and endless energy. 
 It takes time before the truths begins to unravel. I guess some truths were quite easy to guess, but others not so much. Every secret, every reason, everything that happened in their relationship made Tyler into who he is today and all of it made Memphis live with regret in his heart. 
 Really enjoyed getting to know both Memphis and Tyler in the present as well as in the glimpses into the past that implies how much Tyler changed BECAUSE of what happened between the two of them 10 years ago. Memphis changed as well in a way, though some things remained - his constant movement and activity, but him becoming a stuntman has everything to do with saying ""fuck you"" to destiny and living life and mostly danger to it's fullest after surviving cancer. 
 Highly Recommended as the first one is! I do think it's better you read the first one before this one as you might get confused with the characters that were introduced in the previous one (Alec, Dylan and Noah). Well, maybe confused is a harsh word as they don't appear so much but I do think that knowing who they are makes it easier. 
 I feel kinda sad finishing this review as I KNOW it would take time before the next is published and I don't have anything else by River to read.. so even though I'm excited about the next books I have on my list, I feel reluctant to move on...

 The story contained the 'us against the world' trope which I particularly wanted to read. 
 I must say that Cord is one of my favourite heros. His calm, quiet demeanor and no-fuss attitude to life are characteristics I find attractive. In addition his droll, slightly cynical, sense of humour gives great insight as to how someone in such an unfair circumstance might maintain their sanity and a semblance of good spirit. 
 The story was quite repetitive - at times it felt like one of those PowerPoint presentations where there's a detailed introduction, the content and then a recap of the content - for example, if I bothered to go through the book to count the number of times people told the story of Cord's and Annie's marriage ceremony I'm sure that I would find it excessive.

 Warning: This book presents Blondes discrimination, check your hair color before reading it. 
 Here is the thing: This is NA and we all know what to expect, right? 
 Drama, angst, more drama more angst, sex, angst and happy ever after(if it is a standalone, if it is not, is happy for a while) 
 But the rule is: there need to be something to keep the two lovers apart. 
 I have read it all: they are brothers, they are the fiance of the brother, of the sister, of the best friend, they are stepbrothers, they are emotionally unavailable, she is a stripper, he is a stripper, one of the two is a murderer ( while compiling this list I've started to question seriously the thing I read), but in this book? 
 There is absolutely no reason why the two shouldn't be together from page two. 
 Not one, zero, nada. 
 So it's a case of lack of communication? Nope, they communicate very weel. 
 They can't say the magic three words? No, they do. Several times. 
 They belong to rival families? No. 
 They...? No 
 So I've spent the whole book waiting to understeand what was their problem. 
 At a certain point, since all the girls that Jamie dated were blondes with blue eyes , while the protagonist was of mixed race , I've started to think that he didn't want a black girlfriend (but that was not the case, because I would have given this book one star and a complaint to the publisher) 
 A a certain point of the book I felt like that the Mc loved the idea of loving Jamie, but had no intention of doing something about it(if not for screwing with his head and somethimes him).And that would be ok in another type of book, but in NA I want justified, even if silly ,angst. 
 Not 15 years of back and forth for no reasons. 
 And i've sill haven't understood why he got together with the Mc protagonist if he was in love with Brecks(it's not a spoiler, it's page three). 
 Oh, and I have no idea how they solved the problems career vs family life. 
 But they will will always have the surf. 
 Some things were done really well, for exemple I loved how the whole storied was told in relation to whisky , the types of whisky , how whisky becomes as the years go by and how rehab from alcolism function, each part of the story started with a section dedicated to whisky.

1764,5099602,3,"""Actual rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars. 
 One of the criteria in which I rate books is based on its re-readability. I enjoyed some elements of this and was unsure of many others. Despite liking this book overall, I don't think I'll be rereading it anytime soon. 
 The central thing that appealed to me the most in Graceling was definitely the relationship between our protagonist, Katsa, and Po. For one thing, I adore the slow build between these two characters. Both Katsa and Po are very much fleshed out as characters here and this book makes sure these two characters are friends first before it decides to develop it further into the boundaries of romance. When I mean that Katsa and Po are 'friends' first before lovers, what I mean is that they are actually friends - not long-time crushes (although they did have initial attraction towards one another), not flirty acquaintances. No, I mean they are the fighting partners kind of friends, they are travelling companions, they have that kind of relationship where two people are strong on their own, know that they are strong together and they always trust each other to have each others' backs. Po knows that Katsa doesn't need protecting and Katsa knows that Po doesn't need it as well. It is so rare for me personally to find a relationship like this in the YA I read so I am so glad I get to read about it in this one. 
 Another thing that works for me with regards to Katsa and Po's relationship, it doesn't drag with pages and pages of pining and a will-they-won't-they vibe. Their friendship builds up very gradually and the romance is really subtle (and subtle romances are the things I live for). Even after they 'get together', Katsa and Po don't act that much differently and - thank god - I didn't need to read through pages and pages of their whirlwind love story while I wait for the plot to resume. That romance feels like a side dish instead, an extra addition to their relationship. The plot and story continues on. 
 Unfortunately, this is one of the things I feel that this story lacks a little - A plot. Well, there is an actual plot, yes, but I feel that it is lacking, that the premise is simple and thus, may seem a bit uninteresting - plus, we only realise that there is a plot after like 100 pages. Much of the book focuses on the journey that our characters take to get from one place to another. These segments are long - and I feel they may be too long. The only good thing about this though is that it makes for great opportunities for further character development. Other than that, I feel that that may be it. The book seems chock full of descriptions of which terrain the characters are traipsing through that day, what they did while they hunted, what the weather was like while they travelled, etc. 
 In the end, when we get to the big conflict, uncovered the mystery and discover who the real villain of the story is, I found him less than impressive. Like many other villains who fall for this trope in YA, much of why this character is the villain was due being told that he is the villain, that he is a bad and evil person rather than us seeing for ourselves why. By the time we get to meet said villain, he only appears about 5% of the book before he gets defeated. I felt that the villain's sparse presence in the book made the tension we were supposed to expect to be very little. We don't feel so threatened by him because in the end, when we meet Leck just 90% into the book for the ultimate face-off, Katsa defeats him easily . 
 The other minor characters in the book were alright but I felt they weren't as fleshed out or interesting as the two main leads. The world-building was adequate - since we get loads of description of it from all the travelling the characters had to go through. Unfortunately, there was nothing quite interesting about the world that would distinguish it from ours - other than the addition of Gracelings. The concept of Gracelings were interesting although it isn't delved and explored deeply as I would have liked. 
 Overall, I gave the book 3.5 stars mostly because of Katsa and Po's relationship. I did feel the story tends to drag a lot, especially in the beginning and we get more slow pacing sporadically throughout the book. Other than that, it is the two characters and their relationship that appealed me the most. I may pick up one of the next books of the Graceling series since I am curious to know how Bitterblue turned out, although at this moment, I'd like to take a break from Madam Cashore's world for a while.""",2016-01-02 07:05:50,"Graceling (Graceling Realm, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;romance;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Kristin Cashore

1773,186074,1,"""I picked this book up after hearing great things about it from a friend, and when I started researching it online I'd been told that it was brilliant. I mean it's got a ridiculously high Goodreads rating and I've read some really positive things about it on Reddit. I was hoping to throw myself into a book where I'd just be sucked in by the story, the characters, the world etc. - maybe something like a modern day Lord of the Rings, or an adult version of Harry Potter (both of which I've actually seen this compared to!?) 
 How sorely mistaken I was. 
 The characters are just awful and unbelievable, and the world Routhfuss is trying to create has no historical mystery whatsoever: 
 The protagonist is a smarmy know-it-all (I can't help thinking that he might be losely based on the Routhfuss himself) and his sidekick is a bit of a wimpering suck-up. 
 The first 'demons' we're introduced to (supposedly terrfying mythical beings) are essentially just big spiders that are seemingly killed by anyone who trips over them. Not exactly the kind of thing that would inspire fear in the heart of the reader. 
 On top of that the writing is really dull and unimaginative. There's no cohesion to make it believable. It's like someone has tried to combine modern American English with as many fantasy cliches as possible. No seriously. The first two characters we're introduced to are called 'Graham and Jake' but the protagonist is called Qvothe, and is nicknamed E'lir (The Wise One). Oh and there's a scribe who is meant to be the one writing the story that's being told - his name is 'Chronicler'. Chronicler. Who writes Chronicles. Ugh. 
 But worse than that is the descriptive language. I've literally just read the word 'grin' to describe a smile about 15 times in the space of 3 pages. If you want some more specific examples just have a look at the other scathing reviews that people have written on Goodreads. It may be overly harsh to give this one star but since the overall rating is still over 4.5 it seems appropriate. 
 Basically I just don't know whether it's worth persisting for another 550 pages when I know there are plenty of books out there that I could spend my time on; books that I will actually enjoy. 
 I've never given up on a fiction book before but I'm sorry Mr. Routhfuss this is going to have to be my first.""",2015-08-28 03:00:57,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 There are some annoying things about the way P.C. Cast writes. Sometimes it sounds like she is trying to hard to make Zoey sound cool. I've also noticed that when Zoey is in a stressful situation, like at the end, she almost becomes cocky and too confident. I don't get how when she is getting ready to take care of a situation she never knows what to do, but when she actually gets there she talks like she knows everything and has no questions as to what needs to be done. It just doesn't seem to fit, her character changes, OH and the dialog always goes south too. It sounds like a 3rd grader wrote the dialog. ""I'm going to kill you."" haha I don't know, she lost all creativity when it came to those parts. 
 At the beginning I was really annoyed that Zoey was letting herself get swept up in every boy that crossed her path. I couldn't wait for Erik to come back. But, now I'm torn. When she is with Erik, I think, WHY would she not choose him?! HOW can she even think of anyone else but him, he is so sweet to her. But then when she is with Heath, I start liking them together too. I love how obvious it is that he loves her and is so NOT freaked out about her like her other human friends. In fact he was never freaked out about it, right from the beginning. So I am eager to read the next book to find out how this all going to play out. 
 There were certain things in the book that I thought were predictable. I had a feeling about what was going to happen to Stevie Rae from early on in the book.

It satisfied the purist in me and excited the part that is always looking for logical and rational explanations for the extraordinary. 
 While I enjoyed it immensely, I will admit portions dragged on and on, lacking meaningful story and plot progression. The momentary monotony however, was vastly overshadowed by the grounding conclusion. The point this entire novella is leading up to was both unexpected and hugely thought provoking. 
 This ""moral of the story"" will stick with me for quite some time.""",2014-08-30 18:26:23,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson
1780,186074,5,"""There are parts of me that loved this story and parts of me that were irritated by The Name of the Wind. Eventually the good outweighed the bad... So I settled on 4 stars. 
 Let's begin with The Name of the Wind synopsis. So, our hero Ged starts out with no Mom and basically no Dad and learns from his Aunt that true names of objects allow you to control them with magic. He is arrogant, cocky and soon heads off to the University where he has a rivalry with an older student and uses magic he barely understands way too early in his magical career. Oh and he beats up a dragon randomly? Weird. Wait a sec... This is the wrong book completely! My bad. 
 Ok. Let's try again. Our hero from The Name of the Wind, Harry Potter, learns his parents were murdered and Harry goes off to the university to learn magic. He is arrogant, cocky, and also very poor in the beginning novels. He is constantly wanting to find the murderer of his parents... Wrong book again?! This is getting weird. 
 Alright, I'm sure you get my point. It is very apparent that NotW is a very derivative piece of literature. So you may ask... Why the 4 star rating? And to be honest, I almost gave this 5 stars. The way The Name of the wind is presented is really what sold me. The whole novel reads like you are hearing a grand story on a camping trip from a wise old man. The prose is elegant, yet simple at the same time and I could not put this down. 
 I'll try to sum up how I feel. Was Qvothe a pompous and fortuitous prick most of the book? Yes. Was this book very similar to other fantasy novels? Yes. But at the end of the day, NotW had me captivated from page one with the writing style, prose, and pace. Any author that makes me want to stay up late into the night reading a story I've already read before, with an asshole main character is a pretty spectacular author in my book. 
 Yep... I'm changing this to 5 stars.""",2013-05-29 13:56:56,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 Now that that's aside -- the book. I liked it a lot. It was a solid book that intrigued me and kept me reading. I enjoyed all of the characters (especially the Doorman!) and their interactions with each other. The plot was interesting and most of all, everything was extremely well-written. I really liked this book.

1782,15797848,2,"""First of all, I want to say thank you because I was lucky enough to receive an ARC of this book. This is a completely honest review, and it is spoiler-free. 
 I find it very hard to rate and review this book since it's so different from other things I've read. It's like a cheesy horror movie in book form. 
 I won't lie; the beginning was pretty bleak, and I found myself completely disconnected from the story. It felt like a basic contemporary instead of a murder mystery/horror, and everything was confusing because of that. The writing doesn't seem to suit the overall story and felt awkward at times. Then, in any scene where a murder wasn't taking place, there was a complete lack of ambiance and creepy feels. Although, I must say, when a murder was taking place, I could feel chills going down my back. A success right there. 
 The first 50 or so pages lack a lot of action and basically only serve to set up Makani's relationship with Ollie (they're the two leads). Their relationship felt so awkward to me, at times. I just couldn't jump aboard the ship. 
 Now, the problem with these ""slasher"" stories is that the victims tend to be very stupid. I know I'm probably taking it too seriously, but I was always seriously annoyed. Like, if you hear mysterious noises in your house, find things out of place, and know that a psychotic killer is on the loose, you wouldn't just go about your day all casual. But that's what happens in many of these cases. 
 However, the murders are, in my opinion, quite unique and definitely creepy. They're not your typical murders; they're freaky and chilling and everything that happens beforehand sets them up quite well. Basically, my favourite chapters were when someone was dying. 
 In the end, it's a pretty good story, if all you want is to see creepy deaths. There's no character development, and at times, the plot does not go smoothly at all, but I wouldn't say that I regret reading this. It was fun, in its own way. Definitely an eerie and unique tale of wonderfully gruesome murder.""",2014-08-20 09:42:56,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins

1786,12015809,4,"""A Solid Core of Alpha is an impressive book. It's intense, angsty, drama filled, and sure to make you cry more than once. Even so, once the drama stopped and the inevitable slow glide to a happy ending started, the book started to lose me. The characters definitely deserve a happy ending but when the story lost it's intensity, the characters did as well and ultimately the book ended on a whimper as compared to the explosive beginning. I would still eagerly recommend this story to those who love angst and drama filled stories. This is intense in the best ways and sucks you in right from the start. This is definitely a not miss book. 
 The story is two parts. The first is Anderson alone on his shuttlecraft after his mining planet has been destroyed by a meteor. He's the only survivor and at age 12 he has no idea how to program the ship. He's plunged into a hyperspace that lasts for over 10 years, forcing Anderson to cope with excruciating loneliness by adapting his holodeck. The people Anderson creates become his family, his friends, and his companions. Yet as the holograms become sentient, they change and evolve, sometimes in violent and dangerous ways. The second part is when, despite all the obstacles, Anderson makes it to a space station where he encounters brilliant but lazy engineer CJ. CJ is enamored of Anderson but understands that Anderson is not quite mentally healthy and will need time to recover. It's not easy but it may be worth it. 
 The story starts with a bang, literally. Anderson's world is destroyed before his eyes as he's launched in a shuttle all alone. Right away the story is intense and emotional. This is perhaps some of Lane's best writing as she describes the incredible pain and loneliness Anderson experiences. Reading along as he grows up, changes, and builds a family of holograms is engrossing, captivating, and emotional. In fact I had to take a few breaks because as much as I already adored Anderson, his journey is hard to take and definitely made me cry a couple of times. The description and writing is incredibly fluid and seamless, owing in large part to how absorbing the story is, so it sucks you in right from the beginning and doesn't let you go. 
 The imagination and ideas are really quite good as is the perfect touch of strengths and weaknesses to all the characters, Anderson and the holograms. They become as real to the reader as they do to Anderson. It's really quite a credit to the writing and the story. This intensity continues as Anderson eventually docks at a space station and encounters CJ. Here the story almost recants the first part, as CJ and his sister Cassie watch the recorded footage of what Anderson went through. What makes this work so well is while the first part is seen through an innocent young Anderson's eyes, the second part is seen through more experienced and heartbreaking perspectives. This increases the angst and easily made me cry again for what Anderson experienced. You understand the full scope more with CJ's narration. 
 Now once Anderson starts to get the help he so clearly needs is where the story kind of loses me. I feel bad saying that because the depiction of PTSD and the portrayal of support are very well done. It's a bit overly positive and somewhat easy but considering the wealth of drama and angst already included in the story, the choice is very understandable. My issue is that the time line skips over the hard work of Anderson's therapy and gives brief happy glances at the long distance couple of CJ and Anderson. This isn't bad per se, but the sudden decrease in intensity and gradual movement to a happy, anticlimactic ending just kind of let me down after such an explosive and intense 2/3rds. It's a nice way to end the story as it doesn't make you feel as drained as perhaps the more angst-ridden parts, but it's such a different tone and pace it threw me. 
 However this is a really minor concern in the face of a really stunning book. I'd definitely rate most of this book close to a 5 but the ending pulls down the rating for me. It's easily a book I will read again (maybe even in paperback) as it's incredibly well written and offers a captivating look at mental health in extreme situations. I have a few qualms over CJ's characterization and his interaction with his sister Cassie is beyond annoying but again these are likely to be reader specific. Lane fans that love her angst work will devour this one while those new to the author that appreciate well written drama should definitely pick this up. If you're not into something intense or slightly controversial (PTSD) then this one's not for you.""",2011-09-28 05:09:12,A Solid Core of Alpha,fiction;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Amy Lane
1787,7634439,2,"""Force of Law has been quite a few rave reviews around the 'net as a delightful, fun read with a super alpha hero. Who doesn't love an over the top alpha so of course I had to check it out. Although Force of Law offers nothing especially original, unique, or different to the genre, the nostalgic appeal of such an over the top, exaggerated book will appeal to romance lovers who love classic romance novels from the '80s. In fact, this book could easily have been written with a female mechanic in place of Tom and been exactly the same. Well not exactly as a few explicit scenes would have to be altered by one or two words, but other than that the story is easily the same. 
 The plot truly reminds me of old time romance stories with all the classic stereotype characters. If this had been with a female lead, it could be called The CEO's Dirty Secret or something. Here poor, culturally ignorant Tom is a hard working mechanic trying to get over his richy rich ex-boyfriend that dumped him for the woman he's now marrying. In a particularly contrived twist, the hated cousin Law Castille that runs the family empire as CEO decides to take Tom to the wedding. This doesn't make much sense but like most of the plot, it doesn't really matter and the more modern prose helps keep the story moving from one cliche to the next. After the wedding scenes, which are amusing and fun to read, the story goes into a few side plots with a ridiculous and superfluous blackmail and road rage scenes. Neither of these subplots is well thought out or even important at all to the characters or the purpose of the story and maybe exists to extend the word count. Other than that, I'm not sure why they are there. 
 The characters are amusing and entertaining, likely to appeal to fans that can delight in classic themes. Law is the super alpha to end all alphas, outrageously rich and prone to extravagant gestures such as arriving in a Lamborghini or picking Tom up in a helicopter for a date. This casual use of wealth again reminded me so much of those '80s romance novels where the big, alpha male dominants the tongue-tied virgin (and yes Tom is a virgin) with smooth gestures and an air of cruelty. That is until the handsome, overbearing man admits he's in love with said ingenue and the power shift changes. This is close to what happens in this offering with Law as over the top as he can be while Tom is pretty clueless and submissive, despite all claims to the contrary. The pairing is nice with some electric chemistry but again, nothing especially different. 
 I personally struggled through parts of the book since they felt so familiar with a been there/done that feel. There is a more modern twist to a lot of prose and phrases used and the teenager sister in Roxy is absolutely delightful. I'd recommend this title to those readers who still like the classic romance stories -which are classic and beloved for a reason - but you should read it in that mindset. The super alpha male will definitely appeal to readers and Tom has enough charm not to be overwhelmed. While I didn't hate the book by any means, the lack of anything new or different bored me personally and this reaction will be highly subjective among readers.

I've really pulled back on reading NA but when I saw No Kissing Allowed, I couldn't resist requesting it. It has one of my favourite love trope: forbidden romance. I'm always curious to see how the author gets the characters to hurdle that obstacle. This story had its ups and downs but I definitely found it enjoyable at the end. 
 First off, No Kissing Allowed had one of the most overused trope in NA stories. Yes, it's the serious girl falls for casual guy one. We have Cameron, our girl that only ever has serious relationships and then we have our guy Aidan who has never been in a committed relationship before meeting her. There's mutual attraction which leads to real feelings but obviously Aidan refuses to commit. Cameron secretly holds on hoping she'll be able to change his mind. I saw all of this coming so the book definitely suffered with its predictability. 
 Onto the things I loved about the book. Cameron is a really great NA character. Even though she hopes she can change Aidan's mind, she doesn't blindly hold onto that hope (which was the norm in NA stories). Knowing what was best for her, she had the strength to walk away from him when he couldn't give her what she deserved. I had respect for Cameron because she respected herself. Even when she was in a tough situation, she was able to hold her own. 
 The forbidden romance did not disappoint me. It was full of hesitations but brimming with tension. I didn't fall for Aidan like Cameron did mostly because I couldn't get behind his hot and cold attitude towards her. The way he changed his mind back and forth just wasn't very believable. I did like that when they were at a stalemate, they gave each other time and space to think. 
 ""But sometimes we needed to sort out our thoughts in silence, the quiet giving way to understanding in a way words never could.""

 Ella is a simple girl but she has genius parents. Her mother created a technology where you can relive your happiest memory inside your mind and her dad brought nanotech and robotics to a whole new level. However, with her mother being gravely ill and her father dead, Ella was alone as she was thrust into a world that went beyond her mind. Then she meets Jack and through a series of events, she begins to question everything in her life. How can she not remember this guy who claims to have been the love of her life once? Both Ella and I wanted to know and once she made her decision, she was set on finding out. The romance takes a backseat in this book but Jack was a driving force in Ella's journey. Regardless of their past, he was there for her every step of the way. 
 As the story progressed, a string of mysteries followed. With the aid of a supposed terrorist organization and Ella's ability to see into people's memories, she makes disturbing discoveries about the government and the people close to her. There are people who want to twist her dad's work into something sinister. With the use of her mom's creation, she was being manipulated into helping.  But most startling of all, she uncovers the truth about herself. I definitely didn't imagine that Ella wasn't exactly human anymore . 
 The villain reveal was a bit anticlimactic for me. Maybe because I've watched too much crime dramas but I totally expected Ms. White  to be the bad one. I might have even been chanting for it :P Albeit, that twist at the end where we realize Jack was turned too , did shock me. Ummm excuse me what?! Thinking back now it does make sense because all the signs were there. I just brushed them aside as bigger things happened and needed explanations. So clever.

There's so much but too spoilery to talk about so I won't say anything. Just know that even at the end of the book, my mind was still reeling from some of the answers Ella found.

 Wow this book was intense and sometimes too much (no pun intented). The feelings hit you pretty hard. Even if you can't fully relate, you can still sympathize with what the characters were going through. It focused on healing and moving on from a traumatic past in the most realistic way possible. This book has excellent pacing that allowed the character to develop and the story to make sense. 
 Blythe and Chris were deeply connected even though they themselves didn't know how until the very end of the book. I love that they knew of each other's existence but were unware exactly who each other are and what they mean to each other. The readers were indirectly told in one early chapter of their first meeting (from Blythe's POV) and throughout the book it was killing me that Blythe and Chris didn't know!! Especially when Chris was being a stupid a**hole and running away from Blythe to marry someone else. The shock. I was not ok with how easily Blythe took him back after that. However, I do understand that she loves him and wants to help him cope with his past like he helped her overcome her parent's death. 
 I think Jessica Park really conveys the raw emotions of the characters well. Each of the Shepherd siblings were profoundly affected by their father's abuse. Whether it was Sabin's alocoholism or Eric's inability to commit to a relationship, they were all reeling in different ways. Realistic ways. Nobody's invincible but they can heal with time and with help from their loved ones.

1796,14069,4,"""Great discussion of racial prejudice and civil rights disguised in fantasy metaphors, backed by some tense action scenes and supported by a mystery subplot. However, it holds itself back by including a long and boring middle section. 
 Setting: 
 Early 1800's Europe, during the War of the Third Coalition. Except there are dragons. 
 Plot: 
 Temeraire's newly revealed breath led to victory at the Battle of Dover, but also sparked controversy with the Chinese. It turns out that Temeraire is a rare Celestial Dragon, and Chinese law forbids him from accompanying anyone but royalty. Since Laurence interfered with the plans to gift Temeraire to Napoleon, they now demand that the Celestial be returned to his rightful home in China. Under severe political pressure, Laurence is forced to accompany Temeraire on a diplomatic mission to China, where they are expected to smooth things out and prevent the crisis from escalating into war. However, spies and assassination attempts throw the mission of peace into chaos. 
 Continuing the alternate history path, Throne of Jade ignores the War of the Third Coalition for a bit in order to touch on how different China is in this universe. Given China's cultural link with dragons, Novik has made them into a paradise for the winged reptiles. Notably, the incredible number of dragons and their assimilation into the country's culture has resulted in a much stronger, more independent power than the historic China was at the time. Rather than being dominated by European interests, China is this world's superpower. 
 The story has a lot of political intrigue going for it. At the beginning, there's tension over what will happen to Laurence and Temeraire's partnership in light of the Chinese demands. This continues to build into mystery, battle scenes, and a coup attempt. Lots of action comes in towards the end, and Chinese/European politics are deftly dealt with. 
 This is also the book that introduces the theme of slavery into the series, which will remain a central point of the stories. Temeraire sees chattel slavery of Africans during the voyage and notices the uncomfortable comparisons to how dragons are treated in England. This is brought into sharp relief when they arrive in China only to discover that dragons are treated as normal citizens there - owning houses, running businesses, serving in the army, even being worshipped as royalty. It's a far cry from England, where dragons are considered little more than animals to be trained. This is one of many steps that slowly makes Great Britain into the villain of the series. 
 The main problems with the plot concern the length of the China voyage and the anticlimactic resolution. 
 The first one is simple - the voyage to China simply drags on way too long, wasting a lot of time with spurious scenes of the crew. There's some good stuff in there, sure, but the journey wears out its welcome long before they actually arrive in China. A nice time skip would've been appreciated. 
 The ending is a bit more complicated. There's all this mystery and intrigue slowly building throughout the entire novel, only for it to all be suddenly diffused in a single scene. That sort of conflux is supposed to feel climactic, but something about the execution here makes this one just come up short. I think the problem is that it fails to actually resolve all the different plot lines leading up to it, and instead drops most of them so that it can focus on Temeraire and Lien. The result is that, instead of a massive catharsis, most of the novel's story is more or less pushed aside to set up Lien's future antagonist role. 
 Characters: 
 Temeraire grows a lot during his journey in China. His romance is adorable, his meeting with his mother is sweet, and his interactions with Chinese dragons are what inspire him to become an abolitionist crusader back in England - a defining part of his character in the future. 
 Laurence's complex nature is on full display here - his abolitionist beliefs cause a major row with his best friend, yet he can't bring himself to argue for freedom for dragons. He's shocked by how well dragons get along in Chinese culture, but easily accepts the ""fact"" that it would never work in England. It's striking how he can believe that whites and blacks could live together peacefully when so many other Englishmen don't, but he refuses to believe that humans and dragons could do the same. As well as he gets along with the dragons, Laurence comes across as something of a speciesist - this hypocrisy is a defining trait that will come back to bite Laurence.

 Meet Ada the android 
 An emotionally depressed 27-year-old Alex in a future I, Robot society with Batteries Not Included robot elves receives his grandmother's birthday present - a Tanaka X5, the first human-looking andorid. (Anyone else get confused with Jessica Alba's X5 genetically enhanced generation in Dark Angel?). Alex has no intention of keeping his grandmother's hugely expensive gesture, finding her sexual partnership with an X5 a little creepy. 
 Otto looks remarkably like the Fix-its in Batteries Not Included (1987) 
 For safety, no android is autonomous. Don't bother asking one for an opinion, they have no preferences. Their default is whatever their owner wishes. At least that's what the public's been told, though recent events in the news seem to contradict this. Alex tries to return his X5 but found his conscience couldn't allow it. Her childlike intellect (they learn through experience) leaves her vulnerable. One friend phrased it as ' . . . like getting a girlfriend and a baby at the same time.' No one would treat a baby as property. Instead Alex saw her potential. Loneliness probably also had a hand in his decision to keep the newly named Ada. After all, what's better than having a friend you know won't betray or leave you. 
 In order to help Ada, Alex searches for the truth behind the headlines using Prime Wave-X, which is a way to telepathically connect to a virtual reality internet via a brain implant. Can androids be more than what they are? Can they be freed from the shackles of slavery? Ada's eventually unlocked like a mobile phone - a painful and illegal process androids aren't guaranteed to survive, and should the authorities find out, everyone involved would either be decommissioned or imprisoned. 
 Alex's depression and awkwardness in response to this new responsibility were realistic, although he does come across as monotone and unemotional with his lack of conviction or eagerness about anything in particular, which made it harder to care about him. Strange, because I immediately liked Ada, the one without human feeling. 
 However, the fantastic detailed worldbuilding and illustrations more than made up for it, in my opinion. The technology involved in Alex's morning routine, the news broadcasts reporting on controversial android stories and the virtual reality internet forums have all inspired me to read the next volume. That being said, I've seen I, Robot at least a dozen times and 
 Alex + Ada 
 is very similar in its philosophy. They share themes of slavery, freedom and what it means to be human.

1800,38568,2,"""Shortly after I started reading I realised this wasn't going to be the best book in the world though there were a couple of good jokes, one of them involves a cucumber...in a snack's trousers being used to cover his inability to get it up -the dude was anaemic and was faking everything: fake tan, fake job, fake shoulders (i.e. shoulder pads); the other involves Lissiana, a vampire with haemaphobia (a fear of blood) who faints at the very sight of blood. When I thought about this I couldn't help but wonder how she dealt with her periods, an obvious problem that Sands never addresses. 
 I don't know when this book was first published but it reads like it was written in the early 90s. It was highly predictable and VERY slow. Nothing surprised me. I admit I was looking for a light read with a happy ending, and I guess I got what I wanted I just didn't expect it to be this flimsy. The story was mostly about the Argeneau family, only in the last quarter of the book did you feel that Greg and Lissiana were in any danger, though it was glaringly obvious who had put them there. 
 There were plenty of embarressing moments for the main characters especially Greg who was humiliated a number of times though I think these instances were meant to be funny, they just came off as degrading to me. 
 On the plus side the history and explanation of how vampires came to be and the biological side of them was interesting as was Lissiana's mother's life story. Also the way Greg came into Lissiana's life was different to most of the paranormal romances I've read.

 Mini Review 
 Somewhat confusing at times - I felt sort of lost. 
 Characters were quite good, but still nothing that will blow you away! 
 All in all good, but forgettable. 
 Full Review 
 To begin with, I would like to say that I wasn't too excited to read this book. The reason I picked it up is that I was searching in the library and nothing else seemed to click at that moment, so I thought I might as well take this one. I've heard quite a few good things about it after all, so it should be worth something. 
 After having read the book I am really not sure what I think about it (!) There were moments when I really liked reading it and was very absorbed in it and other moments when I was contemplating giving up on it. The first moments were certainly more, though, so I would say that in general I did like this book! 
 The story started off interesting, but I had a couple of problems with it along the way. Not that it became boring, but it kind of lost me at some points. We had to do with thieves and they were constantly talking about great thefts and using a specific ""thief-slang"" or code words, that had me feeling a little bit lost. I also felt sometimes, that I couldn't keep up with the story. They would all figure something out, but it often took me more time to understand it. I mean, I don't like always being faster than the main characters, but being left behind is also not very nice. I kept reading though, because the story was quite interesting and original, even though I was apparently missing some points. 
 I found the characters of the book very well created and described. I had a clear picture in my heads of who was who, and knew all of their characters and how they would possibly react in certain situations. I also loved the interaction between them all! Because they were all different from each other, they made up the perfect team. We have realistic, witty, sarcastic, funny and bitchy characters, and to have them all interacting together was really lots of fun! 
 As far as main characters (Kat and the love interest, Hale) I also think they were quite interesting, but nothing extremely special. Kat's point of view was comfortable to read from, but I did liked Hale's character more. He kind of had more spunk, while Kat was more quiet and forgettable. Something that I found weird about all characters was that the were around 15 years old, but I kept forgetting that. The way they were all described seemed to fit more for 20-somethings than for 15-year-olds. I don't really think Kat's thoughts or the actions of all of them were that of teenagers, so I basically think their age should have simply been switched to a few years older. 
 So, in general, I cannot say I was blown away by this book in any aspect. It was mostly fun and comfortable to read, but not something I will remember about in a couple of years.

1803,13872,4,"""Well this book really had a lot to offer. It was part horror, part satire, part comedy, and could even be viewed as a psychological study of family dynamics. The story unfolds around a traveling carnival, whose frugal founding family has decided that it is getting to costly to pay all of the griping carnies. To combat this, they decide to breed their own physically and intellectually grotesque creations with the help of various chemicals in order to keep costs down. This sets the stage for the rest of the story, which follows both the carnival and the founding family through the thick and thin. 
 Overall, this is a interesting, if not fascinating, read which held my attention. At times I laughed out loud, at other times I wanted to throw the book across the room; the book will run you through the gamut of emotions. I felt there were some issues with pacing and a devastatingly quick climax, which will let you down. I also wanted to point out that this book holds no punches and includes rape, incest, murder, and even tackles the controversy of abortion.

1804,19057,5,"""Sometimes people are beautiful. 
 Not in looks. 
 Not in what they say. 
 Just in what they are."" 
 So far, I'm loving 2017. Several books in, and not a single below 4-star book yet! (That might change with Aveyard's King's Cage. Oh well.) 
 Needless to say, I love this book. Loved it a million times more than The Book Thief, because really, that one was really dragging and iffy at times. 
 Now, I strongly believe that the best types of books are the ones that make you feel. That make you feel for the characters, the story, the idea, the world and the events. The ones that don't need to get preachy with their messages, and convey emotions through the simplest of phrases. The ones that make even the most typical of lines tug at your heartstrings or make you feel. That's what reading I Am the Messenger was like. I felt while reading this book, I felt a lot. Damn, it was beautiful. And that ending! Props to Markus Zusak. 
 I Am the Messenger is a wonderful gem to read, and I'm so happy I read it. It's a story about someone completely boring and ordinary doing something extraordinary. It's a story about people. It's a story about taking action and taking inaction. Seriously, this book was so good. 
 I'm not sure what else to say about this book, really. It reminded me a bit of We Are the Ants, thematically speaking, as both were about people being forced to make choices. But while the protagonist of the previously mentioned novel had things happen to him, Ed Kennedy made things happen to others. And that's probably my favorite thing about this book. I loved reading about the messages he had to send, and what he had to do, and the people he had to deliver the messages to. Milla was my favorite, followed by Sophie and the Tapatua family. The message to his mother killed me, and Ritchie, and Marv, and Audrey - actually, I think I loved all the messages.  
 Basically - read this book. You have to to understand. Seriously. And when you do, can we just discuss the ending, because oh my god.

1805,14064,3,"""3 post-apocalypse, walking dead stars! 
 Please do not head on to read this as a horror book, because you will be as disappointed as me. 
 I won't say that this book is not good. If you are looking for something psychoanalytical, this book will work for you. Maybe its just me. Vampires never could prompt me to feel scared or horrified. To me, they are nothing but a different species, with fangs and bloodsucking routines, which makes them mysterious maybe, but never scary. 
 This book displays the psychology of a man struggling against the odds, with a fervent desire to survive. That results in him ending up locked within the four walls of his house, perhaps as the lone survivor of the human race. I like the parts which throw light on the Robert Neville's mental efforts to live, oscillating between the two ends of life. And then there were times when he reflects upon his past; cold shivers running down the spine every time he thinks of that devil plague that slowly devoured his family to shreds. All-in-all good character development. 
 I loved the way the idea of ""lost companions in a foreign land"" has been used. Elements like the dog, and the half-living woman have helped in shaping the emotional aspects of the book. 
 However, I found the pathological basis of a man turning into a vampire to be attributed to a ""BACILLI"" very childish. I don't know about others, but being into physiology and body systems for years, this sounded too much primary grade stuff. Even if the author really wanted to implant that theory into the readers' mind, I think that half of it was very bland, and poorly done. It was almost as if the author settled on one idea and then abandoned it on the whole, trying to skip to an entirely new area. There was ample scope to allow that finishing touch for better correlation of biological systems and the human body. 
 I think the book bends more towards psychology than sci-fi or horror. I loved the flow of the language, and the clear-cut scenes that the book flaunted; it made it a gripping and easy 190-pages-read, despite of the lack of terror or suspense.

1807,186074,5,"""The Name of the Wind starts out as a frame story. A mysterious innkeeper is in hiding but is eventually revealed to be Kvothe, a hero straight out of legend. The Chronicler who finds him wants very much to write down Kvothe's true history for posterity. Kvothe says that the story will take 3 days to tell. The Name of the Wind covers Day 1 of this epic storytelling session. Things happen in the present time at the inn as well--dark creatures are attacking and the land is at war--but for the most part the action in this book is in the story that Kvothe tells about his early years. 
 Unravelling a little of the mystery surrounding Kvothe is a lot of the fun of the book, so I don't want to say much about what happened to him as a kid and a teen. That will be something to read for yourself. The book draws you right in, with questions that demand answering. Why is Kvothe hiding? Who is his unusual student Bast, and how did they meet? Kvothe (in his adult guise telling the story) drops a lot of hints about what happens to him down the road. I wish he didn't include some of these things because I don't like knowing anything in advance, but really they are pretty vague hints. Your imagination runs wild trying to figure out this character, and this mystery engages you in the story before the process of worldbuilding begins in earnest. It's an innovative way to start a fantasy saga at a quicker pace, rather than waiting for the scene to be set (not to say that worldbuilding is neglected--not in the slightest--but it happens more gradually and naturally than in some stories). 
 Kvothe is a compelling character, even when you don't know much about him. He is obviously an astonishingly quick learner. He was aware of this from an early age, which gives him a delightfully cocky attitude. I could truly believe in his youth. The way he acts and the problems he faces as a young person made me sympathize with him. He's also the kind of teen that many people would like to slap across the face, for a variety of reasons. He's definitely a memorable character even before he becomes an adult and does some of his most legendary stuff (referring to events that will presumably occur in the other books in the trilogy). 
 This is great epic fantasy. The Name of the Wind and the second book in the trilogy, The Wise Man's Fear, were published with glowing reviews and I can see why. I look forward to seeing how the story will unfold.""",2011-11-05 13:34:46,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
1808,1406395,5,"""This was a quick, engaging read. There wasn't really a weak point to the book, as far as I could see. The characters, writing style, dialogue, action, setting, etc. were all developed enough for the story (only a bit over 300 pages) and it seemed well-balanced. I really liked how the book included scientific concepts that were, for the most part, well thought out, but there were never any tedious explanations. Scientific concepts (real and theoretical) were seamlessly blended into the story. People always say that good fiction should ""show, not tell,"" and this book is an excellent example of that guideline in action. 
 The main character, John Perry, had a unique, slightly sarcastic, tell-it-like-it-is voice when narrating his story. His story is one of new beginnings. On his 75th birthday, John joins the army--specifically, the Colonial Defense Force tasked with protecting Earth's far-flung colony planets and finding new planets to colonize. John, a widower, doesn't have much to lose (besides his home planet, but he's not too worried about that) and he stands to gain a great deal. You see, the CDF has a way to make its elderly recruits young again. 
 So, John gets a fancy new enhanced body, capable of doing things ordinary humans cannot. He trains along with the other recruits, makes friends, and tries to get used to a vastly different life. He's able to think on his feet and learns that he's actually a good soldier. But a certain event creates a link between John's new life and his old one, and his possibilities for the future begin to broaden and multiply. 
 I enjoyed this book. I think most people with even a passing interest in space-related sci-fi would like it, assuming they don't mind some cussing and sex. It provided a unique twist on a classic plot. There were particularly interesting explorations of age and aging, as well as other aspects of life. And the characters (especially John and his friend Alan) were people you could understand and pull for.

 If you can get past the fact that it is going to be a slow one and that you will see more of the background politics of war than the actual battles themselves (although there are a couple of action scenes), you will find that dry humour and a lyrical narrative fill the pages and there's a growing intrigue of a deeply layered and very clever plot. 
 The friendship of Will and Temeraire is featured again and their strong interpersonal bonds and loyalty to each other is a truly beautiful aspect of this series.

 Why I Read this Book: This is one of my auto-read series. I'm usually not one to read series 5+ books long but this is one series I can't stop reading. 
 What I Liked: Gin is still the smart assassin we met in the first book, if not smarter. She's good at using dual-purposed, smart tactics and is very thorough with her work. She's not perfect but she does not make careless mistakes. 
 There was quite a bit of foreshadowing going on, not only for this book but for what's to come in the next book, Black Widow (that title!!) as well. 
 New characters are introduced in Poison Promise, a few of which will definitely be in the next book. Some good, some not so good. There are new villains for Gin, and the residents of Ashland, to worry about. And Gin gains a new employee, which I thought was interesting. I think this person is a good fit, as they have many resources. 
 We finally find out who the mysterious M.M. Monroe is and there is a good backstory associated with this character. And when it rains, it pours! 
 What I Didn't Like: The books are a bit formulaic but the author has a way of holding my interest with intricate plotting and the introduction of new characters. There is a very interesting scene at the end of Poison Promise that leaves me excited for the next book to come. 
 Memorable Moment:

1818,13449677,2,"""I try to have an open mind about what I read, which is why I selected The Collector as my newest reading material. The last time I read YA fiction, aside from reading the first three Mortal Instruments books by Cassandra Clare last summer, was almost eight years ago. After picking up my first Dean Koontz novel, I put YA fiction behind me and pursued the titles that lined the Fiction & Literature aisles at my local Barnes & Noble. 
 Because I read some of The Mortal Instruments last summer, I can say that I ""brushed up"" on how YA fiction has evolved in the last few years. Then again, when I was reading YA fiction, it was Harry Potter and similar novels that focused more on story than on what YA fiction focuses on now: romance. Or rather, paranormal romance. It disheartens me to see that is practically the only thing lining the shelves of the YA Fiction section at Barnes & Nobles, or even at my local library. 
 Nevertheless, I picked up The Collector because the premise, about a soul-collecting Demon from Hell, caught my interest, as things of that sort do. I cannot say that I did not expect it to be a typical YA fiction novel, a formulaic paranormal romance, but a part of me hoped it would be different. I hoped to see a real Angel-Demon conflict over a young girl's human soul, something akin to the CW's Supernatural. 
 Instead, I was given the story of a Demon who falls in love with the human whose soul he is supposed to collect for Lucifer. The story in and of itself is not remarkable, although I will give Victoria Scott credit for crafting likeable characters. Dante, the antihero-ish protagonist, unfortunately, grated on my nerves, although he grew more likeable the further I read along -- not because of his compassion and love for Charlie, the girl whose soul he is tasked to collect (admittedly, those bits made me groan with frustration), but because of his snarky attitude and the banter between him and Annabelle, one of Charlie's quirky friends. I found Annabelle to be the funniest and most likeable out of all the characters in the novel, as well as Max, Dante's fellow Collector and best friend. 
 The romance aspect of the novel was rather formulaic and continually reminded me of The Mortal Instruments, though the premises are different. I understand that paranormal romance is what teens are screaming for nowadays, but I feel that it is not necessary for every currently published YA novel to tout it as their main premise. The chemistry between Dante and Charlie seemed unrealistic to me, as did Dante's eventual love and devotion towards Charlie. It seemed out of character, and although it may be attributed to a dynamic character arc, it still feels like there should be soul-crushing heartbreak for Charlie further down the line. I know every teenage girl who does not believe she is drop-dead gorgeous fervently wants to believe that the hot guy at school will choose her over all the other girls, but indulging in that fantasy seems cruel. Perhaps these novels should focus more on the girls coming into their own beauty and realizing their beauty is within them, rather than have some drool-worthy stud point that out to them in some innocent fashion.  
 Despite this, I also credit Victoria Scott for writing an unforeseen plot twist and a surprising (okay, it rather peeved me, but I was still surprised) climax. I felt, however, that the ending was rushed and seemed rather implausible, considering how the rest of the novel had been constructed. Chalk it up to Dante describing the events in first person, thereby also keeping the reader as oblivious and confused as he was, but I still thought the ending could have been treated differently, and perhaps with more finesse. 
 It is likely, however, that, should I encounter the next novel in the series at my local Barnes & Noble, I will buy the book off the shelf to see where Victoria Scott takes her band of characters to next. I only hope that the realm she has created with Angels and Demons is revealed more in the following novels -- and is unique, too.""",2014-06-16 18:38:02,"The Collector (Dante Walker, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Victoria Scott

Jason Hough writes action sequences that thrill, and plot that intrigues. The problems come in the resolution. There's really no grand finale, no insights into the larger issues, and only a cliffhanger to end the novel. It's like the action sequences just dwindle until you are left wondering ""Why?"" Are the hero and heroine really moral? The plot suggests they are taking the high road, but it's not really clear what their intentions are, other than to blow some more stuff up and gun down some more expendables.

 The book offered an interesting start, with Makani as a girl with secrets, and lineup of characters presented as a more than just diversity placeholders. I liked that the romance introduced in the book felt sweet and sincere, even as terrible things were unfolding elsewhere. I'm always all for stories where authors make it perfectly clear that teenagers have safe, consensual sex is not taboo, so thank you for that Stephanie Perkins! 
 But then the killer is revealed halfway through the book and it becomes more about understanding motives that frankly can't be understood. It feels like Perkins is sometimes trying to point out that atrocities happen all over the world every day, but she never offers a view on how we should feel about that or treat that reality. 
 Once the killer's reason for their spree is revealed it's just...sad, and as much as I hate to put it this way, strangely disappointing. I read a lot of mysteries and thrillers, enjoyed the Scream tv series in both an ironic and unironic way, but there was just something about the way this story was presented that just didn't work for me. It felt a little flat and by the end I wondered where the tension was, what was supposed to keep me turning pages other than curiosity about what the point of the story was, and hours after finishing, I still don't have an answer.""",2017-01-10 13:33:59,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins

 I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. 
 You may have heard of me. 
 The Name of the Wind: an origin story of a man AKA Kvothe AKA Kote who became a legend. A story so long that one book wasn't enough to cover it all. A story which was fun to read, but was neither unique nor mind blowing and also took its necessary time in building up. 
 The book starts with a ""retired"" Kvothe who is in the hiding in a faraway place, working as an innkeeper, when a Chronicler who collects stories finds him and asks him to permission to record his life, to which Kvothe agrees. And so we go back to his childhood and exprience the trauma it brought, through his mid-teens where he picks himself back up and gets admitted to the University. 
 At some parts, this story touched me deep. The things Kvothe went through when he was just a kid had me in tears. His struggles were not ""glamorized"" at all and were kept extremely realistic. Kvothe is presented as a boy who is an extremely good learner, but also makes mistakes, and sometimes serious ones at that too. He is flawed, he is young, but there is also wisdom inside him like no other. He is a determined fella. But the fate is not always with him. He gets knocked down a lot, but always picks himself. And he's poor. Always poor. Oh and he's also a musician. Likes to play lute, that one. A good singer too. All in all, this guy is both Jack and Master of all trades. A bit OP imo, but in a good way. 
 There are also some very deep and thoughtful tidbits sprinkled throughout the novel that I absolutely loved. I even noted some of those down: 
 Expect disaster every seven years. 
 *** 
 She peeled some off with a fingernail and put it in her mouth. She wrinkled her nose. ""Bitter."" 
 ""That how you know its real medicine."" I said. ""If it tasted good it would be candy."" 
 *** 
 ""There's no way we can kill that."" 
 ""We'll lure her over the side of a cliff."" Denna said matter-of-factly. 
 ""She?"" I asked. ""Why do you think it's a she?"" 
 ""Why do you think it's a he?"" 
 There are other quotes too that I forgot to bookmark, but trust me when I say this book is full of wisdom. 
 Plot-wise though, it is a simple tale, and incomplete too at that. It is about a boy who lost everything in his childhood, then got admitted at the University at fifteen, and performed wonders. Yeah... its mostly about the University which ain't no Hogwarts, mind you. It was rather boring. There's also a Draco Malfoy in this book which you'd just love to hate. And a phenomenal woman as a love interest. I loved Kvothe and his lady friend, though their relationship was rather frustrating. 
 All in all, The Name of the Wind is an enjoyable read, albeit extremely overrated one. I enjoyed this book, but I'm not sure if I'll read book 2. I'll probably read it after the last book is out too.""",2015-10-05 05:14:27,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

I've seen all three of the movies based on it numerous times, and I clearly recall seeing it on my uncle's bookshelf back in the 1970s. It's possible I paged through it then. Either way, I would've read it 40 years ago. So I'm counting this as a new read rather than a re-read. 
 This is really quite good. I can see why it's been adapted so many times. Matheson had so many cool ideas which were fundamental to sci-fi and fantasy. He wrote numerous episodes of The Twilight Zone as well as classic books such as The Shrinking Man. 
 This is possibly the first science fictional treatment of vampires. It's been done just as well since, but never better. The Robert Neville here is clearly suffering from PTSD as a result of surviving the plague that turned the rest of humanity into vampires. Unlike the movies, the story is more complicated than just ""man v. vampires."" That aspect was unexpected. The vampire characters run the gamut from monsters to masterminds. The Vncent Price film (The Last Man On Earth), the Charlton Heston movie (The Omega Man) and the Will Smith version (I Am Legend) touch on this, but the book has all of it. Quite an accomplishment for such a short novel. 
 The final scene is especially good, with a terrific last line.

1835,23995290,3,"""Hough manages to overcome some of my bugaboos. I hate the trope of ""woke up without their memories"" because it's been done so often and so badly. But here it works. I haven't enjoyed much steampunk or dieselpunk, but this version of it didn't annoy me. 
 That said, there were a couple things I wasn't crazy about. There's a character who exists purely to offer an infodump about the true nature of the universe who then disappears. There's a lackadaisical alternate Earth that's straight out of Star Trek where things are merely reversed: it's a matriarchy rather than patriarchy, everyone's organs are reversed, most people are left-handed, etc. 
 I honestly didn't even read the jacket when I picked this one up. I needed a book that starts with Z for my annual attempt at reading two books starting with each letter of the alphabet. (52 weeks, 26 x 2...) So I was actually pleasantly surprised when the book shifted from a standard technothriller into a space adventure and then moved on to an alternate Earth. 
 At first I was under the impression was an alternate universe story inspired by Hough playing too much Assassin's Creed, but at the halfway point it becomes much more complicated, with multiple worlds involved in a galactic conspiracy. Unfortunately, the reveal of that information is ridiculously clunky, which kind of taints the coolness of the idea. For such a long book, it seems to me there was plenty of space for the characters to come to this info more organically rather than just be told it. I always find it more satisfying when the characters figure things out for themselves rather than be given the answers. 
 If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, there's plenty of action and a number of twists and turns. Some of them felt a bit forced to me, but I wasn't expecting great art here.""",2015-10-09 00:49:03,Zero World,fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;fantasy;paranormal,Jason M. Hough

1840,59980,4,"""A famous Batman reboot from the 80s. Uses the typical story of Bruce Wayne's parents' murder and Bruce going away for years to train in combat. I loved the complexity of what was going on in Gotham City politics, and how Jim Gordon began to work his way up in the police force by having morals and taking down corruption despite imperfections in his personal life. I almost felt like Gordon was the show-stealer in this story arc. 
 I don't tend to prefer the less-realistic artwork that comics used to sport, but Mazzucchelli is famous in the comic book world. His artwork is excellently composed--it's sparse, but every single line counts. He also has a good point in some material at the end of this version--that sometimes fantastic stories are made even less believable the more realistic the artwork (and subject matter) is. I haven't found that to be the case for me, but I can see how it could happen. Maybe someone who's not as familiar with fantasy could look at a realistically-drawn comic and not be able to enjoy it because they wouldn't expect the fantastic elements, rendering them too outrageous to be taken seriously. 
 That line of thinking also makes me consider that sometimes the impact of violence is easier to absorb in a less-realistically-drawn comic, almost easier to talk about and understand in a deceptively simple medium. It's easier to handle the reality of prostitutes, drug dealers, corrupt politicians, etc., when it's all drawn in a cartoonish way. It allows the reader to focus on the story with all of its darkness rather than getting distracted by the darkness itself. Art Spiegelman's Maus and Keiji Nakazawa's Barefoot Gen have a similar effect. In contrast, when I read the new Batwing recently, probably the thing I remember most about it is seeing David Zavimbe's police precinct lying around covered in blood with most of their heads chopped off.

The plot is quite adventurous and romance is just an element in the plot. For many years, Katsa was used as a weapon by her uncle King Randa but she takes control of her life, it was in her power all along to do so but she was afraid for being so strong. She takes control of her humanity. The story is divided into three main parts. 
 Morals are not always clear cut. Main character that is not always right. Po is world smart and Katsa is stubborn but not too proud. She is strong in her conviction and emotions not just strength. 
 I think it's a very feministic book and there are hints at a gay relationship but not much else (but is explored in Bitterblue). There is discussion of why Katsa does not want any children. I liked how Giddon was rejected and simply because he was a 'nice guy' doesn't mean that Katsa owned him anything. There are descriptions of how women are married off and how their fathers and husbands protect them but in the end Katsa does something about this. Katsa and Po make use of contraceptives before sex. They also discuss why it hurts for females. Bitterblue for being 10 is also very strong emotionally because of her history. 
 Both Po's and Katsa's graces are not what they first seem to be. I liked the relationship between Katsa and Po. I thought it was balanced, they respected each other's freedoms but supported each other. In a way the traditional masculinity and femininity were switched. They also talk about their relationship and try to figure it out. There is no real love triangle either and though there was a connection it was not love at first sight as they were friends first. 
 I liked the relationship between Katsa and her caretaker and Katsa and Raffin, you see how family ties are not just blood or near family. The relationships between Katsa, Po and Bitterblue also show how trust could be built. 
 The world building was good. We were given enough information but not bombarded. There is discussion of grief and disability and seeing not just the bad thing about it.

I believe the Daily Show was only mentioned once in passing, and he only mentions his life after the age of 18 twice. 
 This book is good. Trevor talks about growing up under Apartheid and living what seems like an impossible life. And it feels honest. He's not afraid to tell you things that's aren't flattering, about himself and about his family. I think he did that so you could keep in mind that maybe that troublemaker who's always raising hell might grow up to be someone you really like someday, and maybe the guy down the street who seems extremely nice is harboring unexpected rage, maybe the crazy religious lady who's always causing trouble is an exceptional parent. Nobody is simply what they appear to be. This book is presented as a series of essays and I think that idea comes across again and again. And I think another message that comes through in a lot of these stories is how people are driven by what they believe about the world and about themselves, and what they do or don't tell themselves has a huge impact on their choices and how they behave. 
 I know this isn't fiction, it's real life, so you often aren't left with a ""moral to the story"" but I really appreciate it when people write with the intention of telling you what they understand about the world. And some things Trevor mentions explicitly, like how people get separated into in groups and out groups, and the whole Tower of Babel thing South Africa has going on, but other things are less explicitly stated. I'm kind of disappointed that out of all the books I've been reading for book clubs lately, this isn't one of them because there's a lot to dissect.

1856,15677,4,"""I was surprised to find out how different the original novel is from the excellent Hitchcock film. Hitchcock went for suspense and thrills which necessitated substantial changes to the original story. In Highsmith's equally excellent novel, Bruno remains the quintessential rich spoiled psychopath yet Guy is a much more complex character. He is still naive but more intelligent (he is an architect in the novel and not a tennis bum). He is also not as morally strict and this is where the tension arrives in the novel. Highsmith's characters are never black-and-white and Guy spends much of the novel not only struggling with the presence of a psychopath but also questioning whether he is all that different. One particular turn in the novel surprised me yet also strengthened the novel, making it not just another thriller. For those who don't mind spoilers,  Guy actually goes ahead and murders Bruno's father. In the movie, I guess this was too much for Hitchcock and he changed it to Guy trying to warn Bruno's father rather then killing him.  This demonstrates the strength of Highsmith's novels, whether it is Strangers on a Train or the Ripley series. Highsmith isn't interested in heroes. In fact, she seems to be saying that the villain is only slightly beneath the surface in all of us.""",2011-06-24 17:57:04,Strangers on a Train,fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Patricia Highsmith

 This book was so good! I think this is my third favorite book in the series but Nick comes kind of close to being my favorite guy. He's no Cam but he was such a great guy! 
 Steph and Nick came together pretty quickly in this book but it worked. They spent time together and went through some pretty big experiences in the short time they met each other. It was nice to see so much of them and see their relationship grow throughout the book. 
 Perhaps one of my favorite things about this series is we get to see characters from previous books. It's like a family reunion, except you actually want to see these people! Of course this is Nick and Steph's book but it's so nice seeing characters like Cam and Roxy and Reece playing some minor roles in this book!! 
 This great book is yet another reason why Jennifer L. Armentrout is one of my favorite authors! She doesn't have the typical cliches in books and typical teen or new adult drama. It's focused on real-world problems and always puts the focus on the couple. I absolutely love that about her books! Also, her books are easy to read and you can read them quickly if you want to. That gives you time to read other books or re-read her books again! I've read the Lux series twice in the few years that I've owned the series and I've read Cam and Avery's story twice, both her book and his book! 
 While I'm sad to see this series come to an end, I am excited for how the characters will come together for the finale!

 Did I like it? Yes. Okay so I loved the writing style. It was different which was nice and the whole chapter format was unique also and fit the plot perfectly. And Ed was an amazing character to read about. 
 Now the story did get confusing at time and I didn't always understand what was happening but I understood later on. 
 The supporting characters: 
 Ma. Didn't like her. I mean yeah Ed was still living in his hometown and not really doing anything but he wasn't living a bad life. Yeah he wasn't super successful like his siblings but he wasn't a bad guy. 
 Marv. I guess he was okay. I really came to like him more towards the end where I found out his story. 
 Ritchie. Ehhh. An okay character. I guess slightly worse than Marv simply because I felt like Marv was more present in the book. 
 Audrey. I really didn't care for Audrey too much. I mean I know this isn't a romance and I know from the summary of the book that Ed's in love with her but just the way she treated him did not sit well with me. I mean I wasn't expecting her to just fall in love with him at the beginning or even half-way through but I just didn't like how she treated Ed, as I said before. 
 Anyways I liked the book. Not sure if I'll read anymore from the author but this was enjoyable. It's nice reading from a male in a YA book. And the fact that I suppose this book is a contemporary and a male POV is also cool and refreshing.

 This is my go-to book when someone asks me for a recommendation. Whether it's someone who loves to read or doesn't love to read, someone who reads YA or adult, this is the one I'll usually turn to. Why? Because I Am the Messenger is a captivating story that will inspire and steal the hearts of various audiences. 
 The story this book tells is very unlikely to happen, but Zusak makes you feel like it could happen. You are constantly picturing these things happening in your head, just like you're watching a movie. Plus, Markus Zusak has such a way with words; his writing has to be some of the best I've ever read. The way he describes inanimate objects having emotions and giving abstract nouns concreteness seems like it would be..kind of lame but it creates a vivid understanding for the reader. 
 She was in there on her own, making her dinner and sitting there eating, and drinking tea. 
 I think she ate a salad and some soup. 
 And loneliness. 
 She ate that, too. 
 The characters Zusak has created are so real and some of them I felt like resembled people I know in real life. I'm not surprised in the least because the characters in The Book Thief are just as charismatic and empathetic. We have Ed, who on the outside seems like a character that you won't really care for. He's pretty boring and seems to complain a lot. Throughout the book, though, I began to adore him: his honesty, his courage, and his selflessness. One of the biggest flaws in books is that the secondary characters are weak and/or not needed at all. However, Marv, Richie, and Audrey each have such a colorful personality and they all will stay with me in their own way. I mean, I even felt strong feelings toward the friendship between Ed and his dog. 
 The best thing about this book, in my opinion, is the aspect in general. Ed Kennedy receives playing cards in the mail with addresses, names, or clues on them that he must evaluate and deliver a message personal to that person. You can tell Zusak really invests himself in a story before beginning to write a book. There are so many books nowadays that are not very original or just feel not thought out; this book is not one of them. It is obvious that he had this book mapped out and it really shines through from every page. There isn't a page when I felt bored or that a certain part was unneeded. 
 I can understand how the ending of this book can anger people and make them lower their rating but I thought it was superb and satisfying. It was just too obvious to do it any other way. For Zusak to add this twist and add a strong message at the end is so inspiring and clever, and it just leaves the reader with a good feeling, at least it did for me, both times I read it. 
 I don't know if I love this one as much as The Book Thief, but they both found a place on my all time favorites shelf, which is something I don't give out lightly.

 Things I liked: 
 1) All my favorite couples 
 Everyone I wanted to end up together, ended up together and it made me so so happy! Honestly I was getting kind of worried there at the end of the third book, but everything turned out perfectly. 
 (Page 281 made me cry tears of joy/sadness) 
 2) Was on the edge of my seat 
 There were parts when I was to lay the book down and literally repeat ""No, no, no, Neal Shusterman would not do that, it's okay"" because it seemed so real. 
 3) Hayden, Lev, Connor 
 I feel like Hayden is such an overlooked character, so I'm going to keep mention how much I love him! Hayden opened up the eyes of a lot of people in this book, and I just admire him so much. 
 Lev, too, altered the opinion of many people; he's just so brave and has really grown a lot during this series. 
 Connor will always be one of my favorites, but honestly, my heart honestly stopped on page 289... 
 4) Justice was served! 
 I'll admit when one of the characters died, I was a little sad, even though I told myself I wouldn't be, but the other I was just like haha. 
 5) Risa 
 One of my favorite girl characters is back to the way she used to be, thank goodness. 
 5) Perfect ending 
 Honestly it had such an optimistic ending without coming out and telling you everything that happens after, and I love that. Although there were some deaths that made me upset, you knew there were going to some... 
 Things I didn't like: 
 1) It's over... 
 I'm really sad that this flawless series is over because I honestly feel as if some of the characters are my friends, but I'm also happy that it's all over for Connor, Risa, Lev, and all of the other AWOLs. 
 Overall... 
 This series has to be one of my top three favorites. I really developed a love and attachment to it this last time I read it, not that it will be my last time. I'll most likely read it in a year or so.

1866,59980,3,"""This is one of those books that loses its appeal upon repeat readings. Frank Miller's Batman: Year One is iconic, but Miller's writing isn't nuanced. His Bruce Wayne isn't human. He's an action hero, defying death and physics through the sheer force of his badassery. He has Man Pain and kicks through trees. He takes a bat crashing through his window as he bleeds to death in the floor as a sign from his dead father, and I'm not meant to interpret him as delusional. 
 It's too bad that Year One is so often lauded as a pivotal Batman story, when it's really Jim Gordon's book. Gordon is infinitely more human and compelling here than Bruce. He battles Gotham's criminal underbelly, its corrupt police force, and his own personal demons without even half of the resources that Bruce Wayne has at his disposal. 
 There's also the usual Miller complaints of sexism and racism. There are five women in the story: Selina, a prostitute turned cat burglar --and I think the only black woman, I can't really tell; Holly, a child prostitute that Selina takes in; Barbara Gordon, Jim Gordon's pregnant wife; Detective Sarah Essen, Gordon's mistress; and a nameless woman who is nearly raped by members of Gotham's Finest and who has mastered the lost art of walking in heels. All of these women are defined primarily by their function for men. Selina probably comes the closest to breaking this mold. But her turn toward masked burglary is largely inspired by Batman, and Gotham's media describes her as Batman's assistant. 
 There is one other definitely black character--a pimp, who snorts cocaine.

 I still kept griping about that this was a medieval world using modern language, that the characters acted too childish and spoke like they were reading from textbooks. That the parents acted so blissfully happy that Disney movies were rolling in my head. That the dialogs were awkward. Well, I was reading this after The Brothers Karamazov - the comparison was completely unfair. 
 It took 200 pages. I went from griping to be interested. Then completely immersed in Kvothe's adventures. I started to feel like his classmates - admire him but be annoyed how good he was at everything. Smarter than his masters. Brilliant and fast learner. He could act, give a lecture, embarrass his opponents, save damsels from the fire, slay dragons. Be the best musician on the lute - and finish the most difficult song even after one string was broken... oh come on, that's just too much. Did I mention he was not even sixteen years old? 
 Yet he is human, and Rothfuss is a great storyteller with great timing, who makes us feel for his hero, even while he is annoyingly great at everything. I can't really analyze why, with so many annoyances, I still couldn't put the book down. I just gotta give it to him - man knows how to write a story.

Hough's Dire Earth series so much, I figured I'd like anything he wrote. I also hoped this would continue that story. I was wrong on one account and right on the other. Zero World introduces a new story and universe, but it's just as compelling as Hough's previous novels. 
 Peter Caswell is an assassin. He has a switch in his head, that when flipped, allows him to act almost without conscience, knowing that when he completes his assignment, he will be reset, forgetting any atrocities he may have committed. He begins each job as a rookie - remembering only his training and whatever skills he acquires in between. 
 His latest assignment will be the most interesting one he will ever forget. A lost spaceship has been found. He is sent to investigate and discovers it is full of bodies. But one crew member is missing, as is a landing pod. Caswell's switch is flipped and he's sent after her. In a second lander, he follows a preprogrammed course through a wormhole. On the other side he discovers a planet that looks just like Earth - except for the huge scar of craters across the middle. This duplicate planet only looks like Earth, however. Their culture is heavily influenced by this cratered scar which divides the continents into North and South. They speak English, but with market differences. They dress differently, and he cannot stomach any of their food. 
 Tracking his quarry in this alien landscape is already a test of Caswell's skill and adaptability. He also has a time limit. He will reset in just fourteen days, six of which will be required for the journey back through the wormhole. If he forgets why he's there, he may never get home. 
 This book is divided into four parts. I devoured the first part. Futuristic assassins equipped with techy gadgets set upon intergalactic mysteries? Sign me up. The second part was a little tougher to read. Hough introduces his second principle lead, another spy named Melni Tavan. I liked Melni and through her, formed an appreciation for the thought the author had put into creating the duplicate earth. Everything was just off. A different culture, a different social norm. For instance, women are dominant and men usually wear their hair long. It was like reading a book with 3D glasses. The focus was a little weird. 
 Eventually, Melni and Caswell run into one another, complicating their respective missions. Then, in the third part, THINGS HAPPEN. The truth of it all is revealed and it's pretty cool. In the fourth part, Caswell reverts, forgetting everything, and he has to rely on Melni to complete his mission. What he doesn't realise is that his mission parameters have changed. 
 Overall, I enjoyed Zero World. It was new and different. Caswell and Melni were extremely likeable characters. I did wonder when Melni was going to properly react to all the killing, but I did enjoy her propensity toward planning. A woman after my own heart. Caswell's situation came with a lot of build in sympathy, and when he discovered the truth, I was fully invested in how he'd overcome the lie of his existence. 
 My one issue with Zero World would be with the overwhelming number of action scenes. The book is exciting in that Caswell and Melni are constantly running for their lives. But not a lot of plot elements hinge on these sequences. I got a little bored reading fight scene after fight scene, particularly as the plot is actually fairly simple. The magic lies in the big reveal, which could have come a little sooner, I think. 
 Still, it's an entertaining read that introduces a diverse new universe, and while Zero World does work as a standalone novel, there is a lot of story left to tell.

 I was waiting most of the way through the book for when things would start to get heated up, as I had no idea where any of this was going to go. When that finally happened I was excited and confused as the pieces fell together. I just couldn't believe how things were unfolding. 
 I love Stevie Rae's character. Especially how sweet she is after the first Full Moon Ritual or whatever it was. It was really bittersweet and touching. 
 I also love Zoey. She's a unique girl and she's just so.. right for the main character's position. I love her to pieces. Sometimes her vocabulary stuns me at how .. immature it can be.. but beyond that, I really like her. 
 Also, Erik Night sounds like such a hottie. He wasn't shown very much in this book.. but I still love him to pieces. He's so understanding of Zoey and that's really touching. I hope he has a bigger part in the next book. 
 I cannot wait to read the next book in this series, which is, Chosen.""",2009-08-04 15:14:42,"Betrayed (House of Night, #2)",romance;fiction;young-adult;fantasy;paranormal,P.C. Cast;Kristin Cast
1877,186074,4,"""Although I have read all of the Game of Thrones books, I have not read any other fantasy books, and it is not my favorite genre. I decided to read this book because of a recommendation I saw somewhere (I can't remember where now), and I really liked the idea of following a future wizard as he develops and becomes a wizard; and I did enjoy reading the Game of Thrones books. 
 The biggest thing that I think this book has going for it (compared to Game of Thrones) is that you are not following 80,000 characters, and the fact that it is told from primarily one perspective. This makes things so much easier to follow and to not keep forgetting who everyone is if you don't read the entire book in a week (took me just over two months, but in my defense, I was also reading two other books at the same time). 
 The thing that I didn't enjoy the most (compared to Game of Thrones) was the lack of ""OMG, they killed off so and so!!!"". I REALLY enjoyed that in Game of Thrones. You start to get really attached and love a character, and then BAM! they're dead. It also didn't have as much and as dramatic magic use. It did make the magic some more realistic, and maybe this changes in the future books, but I am fine with less realism if it means more craziness. 
 The story starts out in a pretty confusing manner, and it took me a while to figure out what was going on. It starts off with Kvothe after he has ""retired"" as an innkeeper and eventually he begins to tell his story to Chronicler who is going to write down his true story, and that is where we begin the bulk of the book (Kvothe telling his story to Chronicler). It was interesting how Rothfuss builds up the back-story and also introduces some of the legends behind Kvothe before going into the real story. 
 This book has a very nice pace and keeps you pretty interested throughout the book, amazing considering its length. One critique I have of Kvothe is that he is too perfect, he doesn't have many flaws. He is a great musician, extremely smart, a very quick learner, seems unnaturally strong, well liked by most people. He does off his arch-nemesis Ambrose, and some of the masters at the University he goes to, but it just seems like he's a victim of bad luck and people being jealous of his ability and situation. I guess this is a flaw in and of itself, and he also seems to have an anger problem, but I would quickly accept these flaws compared to the flaws that most people have. 
 The beginning of the book is great because of the introduction of everything, and I really enjoyed the Ben character. The end of the book is also great because things start to heat up, and it leaves you with a cliff hanger at the end of the book, but the middle does drag a little bit. 
 I definitely enjoyed this book however, and would recommend it to fans of the fantasy series and/or Game of Thrones. As I said before, it is a bit easier to read than the Game of Thrones series because you are not following a billion characters.""",2014-10-28 19:32:59,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 Glorious. This book is absolutely glorious. I'm so in love right now, I can barely function. This memoir is unquestionable one of the most engaging books I've ever read, filled with such greatly vivid and riveting anecdotes, made more profound and unforgettable by the fact that they're true. 
 I don't watch The Daily Show, other than a few occasional clips on social media, and I never followed this guy before, so I decided to read this book solely because of the title. I love it. Born a Crime--it just feels meaningful. And, it is meaningful. I'm walking away from this experience knowing now that I love Trevor Noah. I love his writing and I love his wit. He is a fantastic storyteller who told of his childhood, one that was layered heavily with sadness, but for the majority of the time while reading his journey, I felt joyous. 
 This memoir is a compilation of notable anecdotes, mixed in with short passages of African history for context against the very special circumstances of Trevor's birth and childhood. Let me tell you, his childhood is better than any fiction and there are too many humorous and affecting moments to count. Some of my favorites include, the time when a criminal, young Trevor, who was being held prisoner in his Grandmother's house (for his own good), crawled through a hole under a fence to get to freedom. Then, there's the time when his first dog, Fufi, taught him his first lesson in love and betrayal. Or, the time when, after growing up on the kind of creative diet that only the very poor are weaned on, Trevor was left completely unimpressed with high cuisine meals such as bone marrow, which are no different or better than the dog bones he ate at home. For more funny and interesting stories, read this book! 
 Born a Crime begins before his birth, when his impetuous and wise mother convinced her kind, white neighbor to give her a baby, during a time when there were strictly enforced laws that prohibited intercourse between Natives and Europeans. The stories he describe span from that time to the end of Apartheid, and further to a time when blacks and coloreds were free to live the life they could wrangle from the system. 
 Trevor's--I'm calling him Trevor because I feel like I know him now. His thoughts on race and power are spot on and made more impressive because of his ability to use humor to show the illogical and ridiculous nature of the whole enterprise. Trevor is very smart, and a very adept communicator. There isn't a single part of this memoir that doesn't pierce you, wound you with truths, yet it soothes you with humor. I laughed because it was impossible not to. I laughed so hard that I cried, and then I cried because I had to cry. 
 Trevor grew up on a divided country, and the numerous poignant moments show clearly a boy caught between the many cultures of South Africa, which he navigated by becoming a chameleon, fitting in everywhere and nowhere at the same time. He adapted to each new situation as many entertainers do, by being whoever the people want them to be. That's not to say that Trevor is disingenuous in any way; no, he's observant, and his musings on life and relationships make it apparent that he has a damn good understanding of the human condition. 
 What is most lovely about his coming-of-age story is how Trevor speaks about his mother. His mom features largely in his story, and his love and respect for her is obvious, not only in his words, but in the actions he describes. Their bond is a tangible thing, and the most moving pockets of this book are the ones filled with his mom. 
 Honestly, this memoir is so brilliantly insightful that there are many many pages I marked, so many gems and memories I've saved to revisit again and again. I don't read a lot of biographies, preferring fiction to real life, but I'm insanely delighted that I strayed from my norm and read Born a Crime. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, sincerely, because it is truly glorious. 
 Audiobook notes: Just perfect. Trevor Noah pulls you in with his animated voice and more than brings this story to life.""",2017-01-16 10:55:24,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah
1879,31549837,0,"""Let's see if I can get everything down without any whiskey metaphors. 
 My friend, Cezanne, from BCS Reviews told me to read this book after she'd read an ARC. I trust Cezanne, and I hadn't read an angst-filled romance in a while, so I thought, ""Why the hell not?"" She warned me that this was a little, ""drama-llama,"" as we like to say, so I braced myself and began reading last night. Yep, last night. As in, I began reading this less than 24 hours ago, I finished it this morning, and I'm trying to put thoughts together enough to write a review. 
 Cezanne wasn't lying when she warned that this had drama up the yin-yang, but even with the incessant hair pulling, I enjoyed the hell out of this read. A Love Letter to Whiskey is the kind of infuriating love story that has the protagonists missing each other, making crazy decisions, and, in general being their own worst enemies. It's the kind of love story that we love to hate, and one I, personally hate more than I love. This one, though, I more than put up with, actually I devoured it. Why? Because, I loved the characters, the writing (with some exceptions), and the engaging (really, enraging) storyline. 
 A Love Letter to Whiskey follows B and Jamie over a number of years and brutal situations as they experience the kind of intoxicating love that I think we all dream about. I loved that this relationship spanned across a lengthier timeline than we usually see in romances, because it made the heartache more torturous. B and Jamie crash into each other as teenagers and keep on wrecking and loving each other for about a decade after they first meet. Their timing is never right, even though their chemistry is always perfect. This book burned slowly at first as B and Jamie built a strong friendship, and then it scorched after each explosive encounter once they'd realized who they were to each other: the one. 
 I told Cezanne that I thought this book reminded me of the Love Me With Lies series by Tarryn Fisher. The writing styles are different, but the general feel is similar in the sense that the heroines are foolish and flawed af, and the authors put me THROUGH THE FUCKING WRINGER before I felt any kind of satisfaction. And the relief that I was given...I'm starting a petition right now, because I need more. I endured so much thirst and I feel like Kandi Steiner gave me a tablespoon of water. Although, I'm not sure a geyser of cool water would've satisfied. Fortunately, this is a standalone (as I always prefer), so the resolution is relatively immediate, but the fact that so much is packed into one package left me feeling slightly shellshocked when Whiskey was over. In a good way. That thousand-yard stare was a product of a trauma I'd gladly experience again. 
 With Whiskey, Kandi Steiner shows that she has some chops. She's a good writer (though I think she--and everyone else--needs to let the drinking metaphors die) who can clearly produce an irresistible read, and that's impressive. I enjoyed her style, which I thought was clever, emotional, and flowed very well. Yes, there were some plot points that I could've done without, drama I could've skipped if only to get some of my hair back, but I had a blast while reading this book, and I can't ask for anything more. Well, maybe a sequel novella, but I don't want to be too demanding. 
 A Love Letter to Whiskey 
 isn't going to be my last Kandi Steiner read. In fact, it probably won't even be my last Kandi Steiner read this week. I've already downloaded 
 Weightless 
 , which I'm told is another emotional read. I love this feeling of finding a new author! I recommend A Love Letter to Whiskey to those romance readers who like their love stories hot and tumultuous. (I forgot to mention how sexy this book is!) Strap yourself in for a hell of a ride, and say good-bye to life and responsibilities--expect to be lost to the world for a bit. You might even want to get some snacks and liquor, maybe some... Nope, not going to say it!

 ""Ride, Greenie, ride!"" 
 Karigan G'ladheon, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, has been kicked out of school because she beat up the son of a nobleman. On her way home she crosses paths with a Green Rider, one of King Zachary's messengers. The Rider has two black arrows in his back, but before he dies he coerces Karigan into promising to take a sealed message to the king. Reluctantly, Karigan sets out to fulfill her vow. Along the way she meets allies and enemies, fights battles with creatures out of nightmare, makes friends with a horse, and learns a bit about magic, and herself, too. 
 For years I've been planning to read Kristen Britain's Green Rider, which was first published in 1998. I finally decided to take the plunge into this big fantasy epic when Penguin released it in audio a few weeks ago. Pleased with the story and the audio performance, I listened to the entire book in just a couple of days. Penguin Audio's version of Green Rider is read by Ellen Archer, who was new for me. She has a pleasant voice and had no problem with the diversity and range of male and female voices in Green Rider. She is a good narrator for this series. 
 The world of GREEN RIDER feels real. In this first story we learn about some of its history, politics, myths, legendary heroes, and games. This is all done naturally and without extensive infodumps. The characters, too, are mostly well done, though the villains tend to be shallow and overtly evil. Karigan is not always likeable, but she's a willful and spunky heroine who I hope will become less aloof as the series goes on. Karigan is supported by several characters that we can't help but like, such as her father, the batty Berry sisters and their invisible servants, a few other Riders, and King Zachary himself. Oh, and the horse! 
 Britain creates a nice balance of tension and leisure in Green Rider. Though murder, treachery, and political intrigue abound, there are several sweet times, too. I foresaw many of the plot's ""surprises,"" and the end of the magical battle at the climax of the novel was a bit silly, but that didn't bother me. Mostly I enjoyed riding with Karigan and living in her world for a time. I will be happy to read book two, First Rider's Call. 
 Green Rider is a nice choice if you're in the mood for a traditional fantasy epic with some familiar elements used in a refreshing, but not revolutionary, way. Those who like Mercedes Lackey's VALDEMAR series will be especially pleased.""",2011-07-19 20:50:49,"Green Rider (Green Rider, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;fiction;romance;history;historical fiction;biography,Kristen Britain
1886,14064,5,"""ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy Literature. 
 I don't like vampire novels much, so I wasn't planning to read Richard Matheson's classic vampire story I am Legend which was published in 1954, is also known by the title The Omega Man, and is, of course, the basis for the movie I am Legend. 
 But then I recently read and was enthralled by two other books by Matheson: The Incredible Shrinking Man and Steel and Other Stories. I realized that The Incredible Shrinking Man wasn't really so much about a man who was losing his height as it was about a man who was losing his manhood. Likewise, the novella ""Steel,"" the titular piece of Steel and Other Stories and the premise for the movie Real Steal, isn't so much about a fighting robot as it is about a man who, similar to the shrinking man, is fighting to keep his position in life. The psychological aspects of these stories fascinated me and I began to wonder if perhaps I am Legend wasn't really about vampires after all. 
 As I suspected, it's not. Well, on the surface it is. Robert Neville is the last human being on Earth. Everyone else has been infected with a virus that causes vampirism, but for some reason, Robert is immune. He spends his daytime hours securing his house, staking vampires, and trying to discover a cure for the virus. At night he hides indoors while the vampires, some who are his former acquaintances, try to break in. During the story there are flashbacks which show the gradual loss of Robert's family and friends to vampirism. 
 I was fascinated by Robert's preparations and daytime activities, and his studies to find the cause and cure for the virus. The thought, for example, of having free access to anything you want, including cars, jewelry, clothes, houses, art, scientific equipment, and every book in every bookstore and library in the world is exhilarating... until you realize that there's nobody to share it with. All those things are almost meaningless outside of their social context. 
 So, this is Matheson's gut-wrenching focus -- what it means to be the last human on Earth, especially when you're fighting for your life. We all know that humans are social creatures, but none of us has actually experienced a total lack of companionship. What would it mean to rule the entire world alone? And yet, as depressing as that is, why, when there's nothing to live for, do we still cling to life so desperately? Matheson writes so powerfully about these emotions. I ached for Robert Neville and a few of Matheson's scenes had me in tears. 
 The story is called I am Legend because Robert Neville gradually comes to realize that vampires, the creatures he thought were only legend, are real. Now, Robert Neville, the elusive human being who vampires fear, has become the legend. 
 I listened to Blackstone Audio's version of I am Legend which is perfectly read by Robertson Dean. This is one I will listen to again. By the way, I am Legend is not a full-length novel, so some versions include additional stories in a collection called I am Legend and Other Stories.

I'm not holding that against the book though. It wasn't exactly what I thought it would be, but it was a well written story that I felt was a lot of fun. 
 First, I wish Charlie was a bit more of a nerd. Go hard or go home. Still, I thought she was a good attempt at not having a heroine that's obviously pretty, but must act like she isn't for plots sake. Also, I wanted a little more personality from her. I felt like she was lost in the shuffle of character development quite a few times. Dante on the other hand was cocky, entertaining, and pretty funny. He also showcased a bit of vulnerability. The secondary characters were interesting enough. 
 What I really liked about Dante and Charlie for most of the book, in terms of romance, is that the shift in Dante's purpose was actually believable. His struggle with doing what he does and being conflicted about doing it to Charlie was built up by the writing and it made a lot of sense. However, for them to wind up where they do, in terms of feelings, in tens days ...I had a little trouble buying it. Still, I'm rooting for both characters and I feel like there is a lot of potential for the plot, characters, and romance. 
 Writing wise, The Collector was okay. One thing that gave me pause were some of the pop culture references and the way Dante speaks at times. Some things he said just didn't sound like something a guy would say. However, I could totally see my girlfriends saying them though. As for the references, I don't know, I feel if things like that aren't handle with care and moderation, it can sort of impact how well a book is recieved, say, ten years from now. That's just me though. Other than that, the book has a solid plot that keeps a good pace from start to finish.

 Enough about my smarts, I don't have anything bad to say about the actual story. I will say that the summary is kind of misleading. At any rate, the writing was perfect for this story. The pace was great and once I started reading, I couldn't stop. I liked the setting and that the author created a society in which the existence of werewolves isn't a secret to the general public. I also appreciate that these werewolves aren't a total cliche. The characters are well developed, even the secondary characters. I loved the relationship between the four friends. Yes, even the dead one. I think it's great that even though Amy is already gone when the book starts, we do get to know a bit about her over the course of the story. 
 I also really liked Tess and hope to see more of her in the next book. This may be crazy, but I'm kind of rooting for her and Ben. I mean, he seemed to genuinely care for Tess and Mac. Maybe he can get his wolf issues together? I have a feeling he'll be back.  
 There was a triangle in this book. Well, it was more like a quad plus one that turns into a triangle. That doesn't make any sense you say? Well, read the book! I really liked the romance angle though. It was realistic, slow, and sweet.  I was Team Kyle from the beginning. I mean, a girl likes a guy that's stable and considerate. So what if he's a wolf?!  The ending was both sweet and sad. All in all, this was a fun read to pass the time with. I can also honestly say that I am really looking forward to finding out what happens with ALL of the characters next.

 Once the book picks up the threads and begins to spin out a plot and a story it's not bad. It has (as a matter of fact) some great passages.

The problem is (personally) I don't think it was a ""great"" idea when it was new. It's okay and makes for a ""nice"" or ""cute"" twist.

This book is still outstanding...but long, oh so very long for the story it tells. 
 From what I've read publishers are now asking that fantasy/science fiction novels be about 90,000 words. I've seen evidence that in some cases lately that may have caused...stretching. 
 This is a good book. The characters are still here, the plot is still here and my interest held, mostly. The point of view changes were for me sometimes a bit annoying and the story telling itself often bogged down. The conversations that take place around the book's action usually start out germane to plot and character but then wander off to superfluous information and topics. There were times I got hardily tired of it... there came a point of sighing over the side roads we were running down. 
 So, a bit long, maybe the book would have done better to tell they same story in 2/3 the space but not a huge problem. Of course I have the next book ( Blackveil ) on my shelf and it looks even longer...oh well, we'll see.

1903,186074,5,"""I was literally sucked into this book. Rothfuss is a genius at wordsmithing. The stories seemed so tangible and the perspectives so realistic - it definitely is a step above run-of-the-mill fantasy novels. 
 The Name of the Wind is the first part in a trilogy centered around Kvothe/Kote, a magician/musician/warrior hiding in a sleepy village as an innkeeper at the Waystone Inn with his student, Bast. The novel begins with stirrings of trouble in town in the form of demonic creatures attacking a villager. Kote is unwillingly drawn in to rid the area of these creatures, and meets Chronicler, a recorder of stories who recognizes Kote as Kvothe, a legendary wizard who disappeared suddenly and mysteriously. Chronicler convinces Kvothe to tell him his story, in order to set the record straight with the help of Bast, who is actually Fae. The first book is day one in a three-day telling of Kvothe's past. In this first part, we discover Kvothe's childhood brought up in a performing travelling troupe, his parents' murder, his time on the streets as a thief and beggar, his music, and his eventual road to University to train as an arcanist. 
 All I can say is, WOW. I need to read the second one stat. Rothfuss has an excellent way of slowly unravelling the mysteries and characters in this rich narrative. Kvothe's story is entirely first person narration while the present-day events between Kvothe's narrative are startling and suspenseful in third person. The details are fantastic and I think I'm a little in love with Kvothe.

1905,8683812,3,"""This is a compulsively readable book, which is probably why it's been so successful. It's certainly a great beach read. 
 A small confession on my part: I read 'The Sun Also Rises' when I was about 10, and way too young to understand the themes of the book. Naturally, I remember next to nothing about it. I haven't read any other Hemingway, but know enough about him (as a person, if not as an author) to know that he was a total asshole. 
 This is not to say that Hadley is an angel; while she kept mentioning how much older she was than Ernest, she acted like a perpetual teenager. McLain, no doubt, wanted to reinforce how Ernest was Hadley's first (and one true?) love, and she never really got over his ""betrayal"" (he was an asshole). Unfortunately, the second half of the book just devolves into Hadley performing increasingly moronic acts in the name of her ""love"" for Ernest. I wanted to reach through the pages and throttle her. She never seemed to have much of a spine (she spends pages of the first half moaning about how she's not pretty, or talented, blah blah) but she becomes a total wet blanket once she finally realizes that Ernest is having an affair. 
 Moreover, Ernest and Hadley are the worst parents, bested only by the Fitzgeralds. 
 Ultimately, this wasn't a terrible book -- it's just not a very good one. I'd recommend it if you're looking for something that requires minimal brain space, but is a step up from the usual US Weekly masquerading as fiction chick-lit.""",2012-06-13 13:55:29,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain
1906,13872,5,"""I first read this book when I was only 11 -- far too young to really appreciate it. I only had vague memories of gross sex scenes and something about a woman with a pig's tail. I'm really glad I re-visited 'Geek Love'; it is one of the most original books I've ever encountered. 
 'Geek Love' is one of those books that you want to thrust upon everyone you know, but can't really explain why it's so damn good, only that they must read it. On the surface, this is a book about a circus family: the ringmaster father, the former geek-turned-failed-acrobat mother, and their ""engineered"" freak children. But it's also an incredible book about our perceptions of beauty and normalcy, how far we'll go for family, the desperate need to belong, the dangers (and allures?) of obsession, and the dichotomy between the sacred and the profane. It's a book that defies description because it attempts to tackle everything, as viewed through the skewed pink lenses of an albino hunchback dwarf. 
 This is not to say that this is a perfect book. There are passages -- whole pages -- of awkward syntax and odd, strained metaphors. There are a lot of people who really hated the ending. I feel that when Dunn gets it right (""it"" being metaphors, or even simple, lyrical syntax), she gets it really, really right. When it fails, it stands out even more.

This book was basically the amount of gore and horror I can handle, sometimes it pushed me to my limits but for the most part it was fine. Based on my limited knowledge of these kinds of stories, I know the general outline, and this felt quite generic to me. The whole thing was very bare bones horror story, not much to add to it. Romance is a huge thing which I didn't mind. It was a fun read, in the weirdest way. It definitely had flaws (the fact that you find out the killer very early is the main one), but it was a good Halloween read. Quick, gory, creepy.

1909,33572350,1,"""So I've been inspired by another review of this book to give up and not finish. When I read that review, it encompassed so many similar thoughts of mine that at first I thought I wrote the review and had changed my name to Bill without remembering it. I hadn't. But I did decide that enough is ENOUGH with this book and I'm putting it down and never picking it up again. Life is too short to spend hours loathing what you are reading to the point that you fear your eyeballs might roll out of your head. 
 I can't even describe all the things I hated about this book but I'll give it a try. I also want to note that I was super excited for this book. It had wonderful reviews from both writers I adore and reviewers who I tend to see eye to eye on about most books. That just goes to show that reading is such a personal experience and that reviews aren't everything. Which I already knew but it's good to be reminded every so often. I highly doubt I would ever pick up another book from this author. 
 It wasn't the subject matter that did it for me. The subject matter was gross and dark but that's never stopped me from reading something or even rating something highly. (All the Ugly and Wonderful Things and A Little Life come to mind.) 
 What did it for me were other things. Among them... 
 The teenagers in this book talk like they were from the TV Show, ""Dawson's Creek."" Maybe you never watched Dawson's Creek? That's ok. You may be better off. (I watched it faithfully and am still team Pacey, years later. I suppose that's a debate left for another time.) Basically it means, that the teenagers on this show talk like no teenager I've ever encountered in my life. I don't know that I've encountered an adult who talks the way they do but the fact that they are teens drove me crazy. Is this a petty detail to focus on? I don't know. All I know is that every time Turtle met up with Jacob and Brett, I almost laughed with how ridiculous they sounded. I get that not all teenagers are going to talk the same way. But for me personally to connect with characters in books, I need to at least relate to them a little. My teenage years are LONG behind me but I need that connection to actually care about them. There was zero connection here. 
 Second... There are endless descriptions of things that just drag on and on and on. Descriptions of guns. Descriptions of wounds. Descriptions of vegetation. Pages and pages were not a thing actually happens except these descriptions. Nope. Can't do it. Maybe if the descriptions were actually interesting or gave insight into the characters inner thoughts. These didn't. 
 Edited: Third...after reading several negative reviews, I realized they had touched on an issue I hadn't. Not because it hadn't bothered me but perhaps because I couldn't quite put my finger on it or express it completely. Or because I was just so bothered in general by this book that I couldn't begin to describe all the reasons. This book contains graphic sexual abuse. Make no mistake. It is abuse. And yet the descriptions almost make it seem consensual in some spots. I also found it gratuitous and unnecessarily vulgar. (Side note-now I have to try to find out why I loved All the Ugly and Wonderful Things. I feel hypocritical in this view. I'll have to do some thinking about this.) 
 I could rant more and maybe I will at a later point. For now, I'm saying goodbye to this book. I can't remember the last time I've disliked a book so much. It's sad as I anticipated greatness. This just was not for me.""",2017-08-04 19:59:53,My Absolute Darling,fiction;young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime,Gabriel Tallent

 Ready or not...love will find a way 
 Single dad Hogan Guthrie is getting his life back on track, and working as the ""barbecue master"" at a local diner is just a temporary detour. He and restaurant owner Violet Shaw constantly butt heads...until one night they end up mingling other parts instead. Hogan thought he had the recipe for happiness all figured out. But loyal, carefree Violet is daring him to trust his impulses...and see just how sweet small-town living--and loving--can be. 
 Nathan Hawley traded his SWAT team credentials for a sheriff's badge, but a gorgeous new neighbor is shaking up his orderly life. Nathan has a hunch there's more to Brooklin Sweet than meets the eye--but given her caution about getting involved, he has his work cut out for him. Still, there's something about the elusive beauty Nathan can't walk away from--and helping her come to terms with her past might pave the way to the future they both secretly long for. 
 My Thoughts 
 Accountant during the week while also cooking barbecue at Violet Shaws diner on the weekends brings Hogan Guthrie a steady income that allows him to provide at least a roof and food for he and his son Colt. A far cry from their previous lifestyle but one that allows the two to repair rifts between them as they spend more time together than in the past. 
 What happens when he and the boss lady join forces is when the diner takes off and so does their after hours relationship. 
 Nathan Hawley never thought when he left SWAT to become sheriff in a small town his hard won skills would be needed, crime just seemed to have taken a back seat to rescuing elderly ladies cats until the arrival of newcomer Brooklin Sweet. 
 Brooklin just so happens to be Nathan's newest next door neighbor, having her living so close makes it easy for him to become aware of her as a very attractive woman he has every intention of getting closer to despite both their reservations. 
 Two romances take place within the pages of this book. Both are sexy and both are about couples whose past issues rear their ugly heads. The thing is though, with this type of story you know right off the bat those issues will be worked out and each pair get their HEA or HFN at least. 
 Good thing is that young Colt Guthrie at almost 18 seems to have found his own special someone to begin a budding romance with so looking forward to seeing how that develops hopefully in the next book.

1912,13872,5,"""Mild spoilers contained herein: 
 Truly one of my all-time favorite books. Possibly THE all-time favorite. I read it at least once a year and have lost count of my total reads. It's not one of those where I ""find something new every time."" It's one where I feel I'm slipping completely into another world that I know, fear, and adore; at once comforting and fascinatingly uncomfortable. 
 Olympia's voice is singular and mesmerizing, whether she's detailing the bizarre, almost unfathomable appeal of Arty, the shame of her lustful, vengeful feelings, or her pride in (and fear of) her own daughter. She doesn't shy away from detailing the despicable things she's done, is doing, or plans to do. She's honest. She's amazing. She's human. 
 The story is, on the surface, about ""freaks."" But at the heart of it, it's just about a family. Granted, it's a hyper-dysfunctional one, but still, just a family, complete with love, hate, loyalty, rivalry, and plenty of darkness, loss, pain, and yes, hilarity. 
 The story touches many facets of the human experience, from the above stated familial issues to the greater societal mores that define, defy, and challenge us all. 
 It's maybe not to everyone's taste, but I find it remarkable. Every time I read it, I find it remarkable. Aside from the completely original story and characters, the writing itself is simply gorgeous. Sumptuous and evocative and beautiful and brutal. 
 I always find myself falling in love with Oly. She's so strong yet vulnerable, so intelligent but bone-headedly human and stupid. So hard on herself but with the strongest survival instinct imaginable. 
 The story is twisted and twisting, always surprising. Once you think you've got a handle on what's going on; once you think you have an idea of what's to come, a violent u-turn takes your feet from you and you're pulled along in a completely different, darker, more fascinating direction.

We are introduced to an extremely likeable protagonist; Kvothe is unrelentingly funny and ambitious, a child prodigy whose wild personality balanced his natural talent and keeps him from becoming overly Gary Sue. 
 Along the way, we meet his good friends who are loyal and funny, if a little one dimensional. The story itself is good, and quickly veers away from the typical ""child prodigy mage goes to magic academy, saves world, the end"" sort of story. 
 Kvothe's failings and his subsequent attempts to rectify them are amusing and engaging, and the world becomes wide and real as he goes off to ""find himself"". I love that we are given an idea of the size of the country.

 Though it seems simple, the book has many layers worth to be explored. Needless to say, the title itself and the overall conclusion of the story, are grayish; which, from Vida's interview, is exactly what she wanted. 'To create explorative self-conclusion', she said.

 My problem was not with the plot - I liked the plot for what it was and I did want to know what would happen. However, I feel like Toibin rushed through the story and that his writing was disconnected to Eilis at best. His writing sounded very matter of fact and I felt like it was almost wooden and didn't flow very well. I think that if he had taken his time with the story just a little bit I would have liked it more. I wanted to like the characters, but I found myself not invested in the characters and I wanted to know what would happen for the sake of knowing and not for the characters. I think if it had felt just a little less rushed I would probably felt a little more engaged. Maybe if he built up his characters a little more and spread out his story.... It is supposed to traverse two years and the book is less than 300 pages. While I know this can be done, I feel like more time should have been spent on the story. The falling in love part of the story is probably the part needing more time. I found myself not feeling the love story as much as I think I was meant to feel.

 Sorry to sound so teenage girl but, OMG. I don't know if I love this more because I saw the movie first, or just that this story is so amazing. 
 The whole story is just Robert dealing with being the last human alive. Not like in the movie where he has the goal of curing it disease.....Robert just has to survive. Can you imagine surviving with no goals? Just living with your neighbor, which I think was close friend, ""haunting"" you every night? No wonder he succumbs to alcohol and dark thoughts. Robert does try and figure out the cure the best he can, but he's just a normal guy, and he still has to live in the world were there is no one but him.

 I listened to the audio book, like most stories I get to ""read"" now a days. The narrator did a great job, he really captured the feeling of the era. 
 I don't know what it is about the story, it's really not that noteworthy when listening to it, but it just all worked together beautifully. Maybe it's that it was written so long before major dystopian stories, or maybe even that with all it's misogynist views, it's still so similar to what could happen today.

Kind of hard to have sexual tension when every single scene leads to another sex scene. The dirty talk was cheesy...I never understand why an author writes sex dialogue in words that would never, ever actually be said by a guy. It's no less goofy to read on paper as it would be to hear it out loud. Example: 
 ""Your pussy's drenched with sleek wetness that I created. Soaking fucking wet, for me."" He moved his hands, holding my feet as he pushed them further apart and went deeper inside me. 
 ""Oh, God! Yes, more, give me more!"" I cried... 
 Come on...is this a porno? Or a soap opera? Maybe just somewhere in between. Slick wetness, really? 
 My BIGGEST ISSUE with this series is the lack of editing. What makes it so aggravating is that this could be an absolutely phenomenal series, a stand out above my other favorite Urban Fantasy/PNR series. I'm putting it out there and saying that it could absolutely top my favorites, for real, yo. :/ Instead, I read and read and grow more and more frustrated. An editor could catch the grammatical issues, yes. (honestly, the grammar here wasn't NEARLY as atrocious as book one) but even more than that, a content editor would catch weird phrases, continuity issues, cut out some odd irregularities slash unrealistic actions of the characters. I don't know how many times I read a paragraph only to reread it two more times because it didn't feel like it fit with the current situation. Or something would happen that I felt was a huge turning point or revelation, but the characters would just move on as if something big didn't just happen. 
 If only a publisher would snatch this series and put it through a team of professionals, like all my other favorites have, I think I could live and breathe in Amelia Hutchins world here. As it is, I will still move on because I'm really enjoying the world and I'm really enjoying the characters and convoluted plot. It's full of action and forbidden romance, the ""hero"" is more of an anti-hero (my favorite), and the heroine is mysteriously kick ass yet also girl enough to cry sometimes. I also love the band of men that surround the mysterious Ryder...they crack me up, and I adore them for their loyalty to him and their growing admiration of Synthia.

 I seriously love this author. Natalie's inner dialogue cracks me the hell up. Here's my Nat: 
 She's got the same kind of potty humor going on in her head that my husband and I have...slightly immature but fun as hell and funny as hell, too. Here are a nice list of my favorite Nat'isms... 
 ** ""I wouldn't say I'm a slut. I'm just in touch with my inner slut. And let me tell you, she rocks."" 
 ** ""Okay, so either my heart is breaking or someone spabbed me in the boob..."" 
 ** ""Turns out I know yoga...""...(after having car sex, bahaha!) 
 ** ""I'm so happy I could shit rainbows!!"" 
 ** ""Lola looks at me as if I just told her that ice cream actually has crack in it..."" 
 So this was freaking hilarious. Natalie has this love/hate thing going on with Ghost, and the sexual tension is so palpable, it's bleeding from the pages. I don't remember Nic and Tina's story being quite this freaking HOT. I'm telling you, when these two finally get down to business...well, here is a little taste of yum... 
 ""By the time Ash was ready to blow, I was ready to blow myself. Through a groan, he said ""It's coming, girl. Where do you want it?""

 An almost cruel smile corsses his face. He utters, ""Fuck yeah""... 
 And then it got a tiny bit kinky....

 After reading so many great prods, I finally started this last night. Aside from a bit of confusion by an odd writing style, it's actually really fabulous. Cord is one of those heroes with a secretive sort of past that is challenging to get to know. And all the while, you're hurting for him, wanting him to open up to Annie. The plot is fairly fast paced. The H/h meet each other on page two, and Annie is already bleeding and bruised. Not a dull moment in sight! Cord is half Indian, which sets the stage, of course, in late 1800s America, for haters to put in their two cents. And boy, do they ever! Even his family sees him as dangerous, and he is shunned by townsfolk to the extent that he has become extremely reclusive. But Annie has always been fairly unaware of the whys of hating. Because of her stubborn nature Cord is able to be, if not completely relaxed, at least comfortable with Annie. They are thrown together through a twist of fate, (and thank goodness for fate!) and a truly beautiful relationship builds. 
 Annie is no shy lady, though she was raised by a rich, proper family. She quickly proves that she is a match for not only Cord, but all of the busybodies and cruel people that surround them. She says this while defending herself and Cord to her gutless brother. ""Make up your mind, Rob, you can't be furious because I'm a shameless hussy living in sin and furious because I'm a respectable married woman too. Pick a mad."" Love that line! There are little quotes throughout the book that Cord and Annie have as their sort of 'couple talk.' You don't often find this type of thing in a book, but I think with most couples in fiction, the reader isn't comfortable enough with them to understand their lingo. Somehow, these little quips become commonplace, and I began to notice them more and more. Cord's 'soup stuff' comments made me laugh, but at the same time, seemed to reinforce the bond that is growing between he and Annie. Things like that were what made me realize that he was finally beginning to find his comfort zone. And when he finally gives in to his feelings, I felt as if I was on top of the world, though all I did was sit on my couch and read this line: ""As he finally stopped fighting sleep, he wondered if maybe just occasionally the gods designed a woman fit for a king or a prince and then gave her to an ordinary man. Maybe they did such a thing once in a while, knowing an ordinary man would treasure her more, love her better. Maybe they even let him keep her - for awhile.""",2011-11-01 20:47:54,"Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold (Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold, #1)",history;historical fiction;biography;romance;fiction,Ellen O'Connell

 I just love Rachel and Jenks. Their friendship and complete and utter loyalty to each other make this series for me. 
 What about Ivy, you ask? That vampy chick pisses me right the hell OFF! I rant about Ivy in every review, but I'll do it again here. She is so freaking doom and gloom, whiny, bitchy, and grumpy. She STILL hasn't come to terms with the fact that her so-called best friend Rachel doesn't want to sleep with her or give her blood, or both. She STILL makes Rachel feel bad about it, and still can't control her bloodlust. I think Rachel is one hell of an admirable friend to put up with her, and I think Ivy is selfish. Moving on... 
 Rachel is still lonely, even with the myriad variety of creatures around who are friendly. She doesn't have anyone of her very own aside from Marshall, and they are trying to keep their relationship platonic and actually doing a very good job with it. Al the demon is now getting Rachel's assistance in the ever after every Saturday...and believe it or not, I actually really like Al. He's a demon, sure. But he makes no apologies and doesn't pretend to be someone that he's not. That's a quality that most of Rachel's other acquaintances are sorely lacking. 
 Trent makes a bit of a cameo (sigh!) but not much comes from it. He's still peeved at Rachel and wrongly crucifying her for circumstances that he MUST know, deep down, were completely out of her control. I love me some Trent, but he's also a selfish bastard sometimes! 
 This installment to the Hollows didn't do much in the way of moving the story in the way that I WANT it to go, but I think I'm okay with the fact that events never unfold the way I expect OR want them to when it comes to Rachel Mariana Morgan. It keeps me on my toes, for sure, and I'm really stoked to know that I don't have the slightest clue as to how the next book will play out!""",2011-04-25 14:31:49,"White Witch, Black Curse (The Hollows, #7)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;history;historical fiction;biography,Kim Harrison

 At its heart, I am the Messenger is a simple story about the capacity for ordinary people to do good. The simplicity is what makes it so moving and beautiful.

Artie is the Aqua Boy and also the leader of a cult obsessed with enlightenment-through-amputation; Iphy and Elly are the beautiful conjoined twins; Chick looks normal but possesses the most impressive mutation of all; and Oly is the albino midget hunchback and also our narrator. 
 Reading other reviews of this book, people kept mentioning how difficult this book was to read, how descriptions of the physical mutations and the detailed accounts of medical and sexual practices made them physically ill. Maybe I need to check my sociopath-o-meter, because I didn't have that reaction. Instead, it was the emotion manipulation and fear and abuse that really tore at me. Artie was one of the most complete villains I've encountered in a long time - he's diabolical, smart, and ego-maniacal but still made vulnerable by the love for his family that he just can't poison out of himself. Artie struck me as a parallel to the character of Heathcliff in Wuthering HeightsWuthering Heights. 
 Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the framing device - the novel is really Oly's confession and explanation to her secret daughter Miranda. We also see contemporary scenes, where Oly spends time with Miranda and tries to protect her from the machinations of Mary Lick. 
 The end of both stories - the Binewski family and Oly's trials with Mary Lick - end the same way: with an apocalypse and the certainty that love really means death. 
 My biggest problem with the book was the way the climax was written. It was quick, abrupt and confusing.

 While the plot of this book did better at moving away from the lotr influence that really showed in the first two books, I was really hoping that this book would finish off the series and find myself disappointed. Instead, I got a lot of unnecessary scenes (those scenes at the wall were unbearable), and a exceedingly dull and easy to figure out plot. 
 The strength of this series is not in its plots or world building which are fairly standard for fantasy. It's strength is that it's a world where women can and have held some of the most important roles in the kingdom and where they are interchangeable with men in traditionally male professions. Because of this, the series is filled with strong female characters, who generally outshine their male counterparts. (Karigan a bit too much, but she's the hero so eh.) It's other strength is in characterization. For example, in this book, it was lovely to see Karigan growing as a person while she taught Fergal. 
 So, it was good to see these characters again, but I wish things were over. That I didn't have to put up with a stupid love square, or that there weren't the exact same threat hanging over them at the end of this book as there was at the end of the last.

From there, it kept my interest very well and was fun to boot, up until Kvothe found his boring and cliche lady love, and suddenly the book cycled quickly from brilliance into mediocrity again, especially with the dull dragon side plot, and then it wound up with a promise of more, but I'm not sure if I care at this point. 
 I liked the magic and how the university worked in this universe, but I don't particularly like Kvothe, and the lack of strong female characters who aren't cliches or there just for the plot is annoying.

 I picked it up and immediately started reading. While I was still wandering the store. With my date. (He got distracted looking at programming books, so it was okay.) 
 I burned through this book on my lunch breaks and in my spare moments this week, and I love it. I bought it just on the name of the author alone, and I wasn't let down.

1940,31213312,3,"""Ouch. Trust me when I say that it pains me to give this the lowest rating of all the other Melissa Brayden books I've read. This isn't bad, but Brayen isn't the most popular writers amongst lesbian romance readers for writing ""decent"" books. She writes the kind of book that you never want to put down and they leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy afterwards. So this was a little disappointing, especially coming after a killer like First Position. 
 Brayden tends to follow a similar formula in all of her books. Because of the whole flashback thing, this one deviates a little from that formula, but that made it more similar to Brayden's debut novel, Waiting in the Wings. That was unfortunate, because I happen to love Waiting In The Wings a little too much, flaws and all, and I just didn't love this one. 
 In WITW, the time jump is unexpected. They have a short-term relationship and then suddenly it's over and a lot of time passed and the book focuses on them meeting again and rebuilding that relationship after so long. Here, from the first chapter we already know things ended badly between Maggie and Courtney, but then the book spends a whole lot of time telling us their story from the beginning. This format is tricky because it's hard to get too invested in that story when we're always waiting for the tragic breakup to happen, and this is what really ruined the book for me. 
 This was also told in first-person, which I didn't mind at all in WITW, and that brings me to my biggest problem with this book: I found Maggie boring. Not because she's a small town farm girl or whatever. I think the worst was her narration. The girls were in high school when they met, which means Brayden ventured into YA territory here, and... it could've been better. Maggie kept saying (and/or thinking) over and over again that she's ""so boring"", that she'd rather stay on her own than hang out with the popular kids (whom she blatantly misjudged without even giving them the benefit of the doubt), that her life is ""pathetic"". I'm admittedly not a fan of small town romances in general but Brayden did that too in How Sweet It Is and Molly wasn't like this. 
 The similarities between this and WITW don't end there. Courtney, like Adrienne, had family issues and therefore expected her love interest to prioritize her and show her that she mattered. The major breakup reason in both books was pretty much the same. I didn't mean to keep comparing this to WITW as I read it, but it was hard not to notice. 
 There were still some really great scenes, but overall, the truth is I was unimpressed. I hate to sound so harsh, but as someone who loves Brayden's work, I just expected better.

1941,18602871,5,"""This book was surprisingly amazing. I'll be honest, I didn't really expect much -- I'm not the biggest fan of YA stories, especially set in high school, and this didn't initially sound like the most interesting thing ever to me, but now I'm so very glad I read it. 
 I wish it had been longer, not because I felt things were rushed at all, just because I would love to read much more about these characters. 
 If there's one thing Dirty London reminded me of, it's that high school is hell and straight teenage boys are the devil. Oh, and girls are freaking incredible. The main character is a serious badass, and it clearly runs in her family -- London, Jasmine and their mom were such fantastic characters. The sisters's character development was so interesting, both individually and in regards to their relationship. At first I was mad at Jasmine for how she treated London regarding school, but god, I can't hold it against a teenage girl for how she deals with the nightmare that high school can be. 
 And London was so damn brave and ridiculously selfless. I loved how feminist her character was; her thoughts about what was going on with her, how she reacted to invasions of her privacy and men harassing her and knew that none of it was ever her fault, her fierce defensiveness and appreciation of her mother, her determination to keep her head high when awful people were throwing slurs at her; even when girls were literally attacking her for things she didn't do, she immediately felt bad for them because of how they were treated by the boys they liked . 
 Amber was just delightful. I liked how natural the beginning of her relationship with London felt; there was no typical love-at-first-sight stuff, London had a crush on someone else when they met, and slowly fell for her as they got to know one another and the quiet girl from drama club turned out to be the one who saw London for who she truly was more easily than anyone else at school. 
 I could talk for hours about how much I liked every single character who wasn't an asshole. I'm also glad that, despite the relatively dark topics, this book never really felt hard for me to read -- as in, emotionally draining or upsetting. That was probably because of how great London's narration was. She was so damn determined to just get through everything that was happening to her. And she was straight up hilarious in lighter moments (""God, I have to get my head on straight. (Hahaha...ha.)""). 
 Frankly, I have no complaints. This was a pretty great read.""",2015-12-29 15:28:17,Dirty London,young-adult;romance;fiction,Kelley York

 Huh. Where to start. This series is just... a big waste of potential. The idea is so original but the realization (the bad writing included) is just gOD DAMN AWFUL. 
 Yet, I have to say that a part of it was quite enjoyable for me. 
 The characters were really flat. Zoey non-stop talks about how special she is and how there has never been anyone as strong as herself. The only thing I got to know about Damien is that he is gay. The way the Twins talk made me want to stab myself. The only character I really liked was Aphrodite. You go girl! 
 There were too many curse words in this book. I just couldn't go with that. They call everyone a slut and/or bitch and usually without any real reason. The only slut in the book was Zoey with her 3 boyfriends. 
 The dialog was just...no. They were trying waaaay too much to sound hip. So much that in some parts it was just disturbingly wrong (yes, I mean the scene when the Twins worry more about the fact that a really 'fiiiiine' guy went missing than the fact that someone went missing. I mean, what if he wasn't 'fiiiiine'? Would they even notice it?). 
 Anyway, the plot twist was good and I quite enjoyed the end. 
 I will continue with the series even though the writing kills me.""",2013-07-16 04:14:56,"Betrayed (House of Night, #2)",romance;fiction;young-adult;fantasy;paranormal,P.C. Cast;Kristin Cast

1955,186074,4,"""This was a reread for me since I'm hoping to read the next in the trilogy soon. It was just as good as I remember, so the 4 stars I gave it before still stands. It came really close to 5 stars, but fell just a bit short. 
 I really liked the pacing of this book. The main storyline occured in the past, and is broken up by a chapter here and there of the present. This could easily be the downfall of a book, but it works really well here. I wouldn't say this book is fast-paced, but it definintely isn't slow. It sits right in that goldilocks zone of being just right. I also like Kvothe; he's really nothing special as characters go, but I like him. I feel everything he's going through, and I truly care what happens to him. It's been awhile since I've experienced a character like that. 
 My only gripe: Rothfuss gets stuck on some things and becomes a bit repetitious. The biggest example would be how poor Kvothe is, especially while he is at the University. We know how poor Kvothe is and has been, we experienced it with him during his time in Tarbean. I don't need to be reminded of it constantly after that. Once in awhile sure, I have no problem with that. But the reader is constantly being reminded of this and it detracted from the story a bit (and made Kvothe seem a bit whiny at times). 
 That is what kept me from giving it 5 stars. I really liked this book, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. I'm definitely looking forward to The Wise Man's Fear.""",2009-04-20 12:02:02,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

The novel has the basic premise of ""exchanging murders"" but goes in an entirely different direction with a much darker denouement. The film always struck me as having some plot holes regarding the actions of the Guy Haines character...........the book, with a different focus, fills in those inconsistencies. 
 It is a very disturbing and twisted story of two men, caught up in a complex relationship, which leads to two murders and much deceit. This is Ms. Highsmith's first novel and set the stage for her popular ""Ripley"" stories which are equally as dark and downbeat.

I was really worried after reading the prologue, it was brutal and I didn't know if I wanted to read the rest of the book if it was like that. So color me surprised when the book sucked me in very quickly and I hated to stop at our stopping spot. 
 I liked Helen/Keller right from the start. Even as a kid she was sassy and feisty and knew the way of things in her world. The last fact was something that I hated that she had to learn. I liked that Hold was a safe place for her, but could see how things weren't going to end well there. Even as kids he had more romantic feelings for Helen that she did for him. I hated that Hold's parents were basically threatened Helen with Hold. Worse was that Hold knew what Helen wanted, knew that his feelings were going to kill her dream. 
 I liked that with Diamond Helen had someone to talk to about some things. I even thought that Diamond gave Helen some good advice, but she was still trapped. 
 I hated the MC, they were so wrong and so evil and at every turn beat Helen down, sometimes in reality, but often because of the way that they worked. 
 The part of the book in the present broke my heart. I liked that Keller got a sense of freedom, but it made it all the worse when her past came back to haunt her. I was a bit stunned with all the ways that they past came back. I did like how finally Hold did something for the girl who was his friend, did something that caused him to loose what he held precious, but it was the least he could do.

1963,59980,4,"""A good friend recommended Batman: Year One to me after I read (and LOVED) Batman: Hush, and although it is very different in several ways, I really enjoyed it all the same. 
 At first I felt slightly frustrated with this book because it starts off, again, with Bruce Wayne's backstory...which by now I've seen in so many different mediums and books that it's started to wear on me. However as I progressed through the book I came to accept that since this story takes place during Batman's first year under the cowl it was necessary to include the mugging and subsequent murder of the elder members of the Wayne family. 
 A strength about Year One is its alternating points of view. As someone who has read many a story that concentrates almost solely on Bruce Wayne's viewpoint, I found it a welcome change to have a younger Jim Gordon narrating parts as well. Both this Jim Gordon and this Batman are new at this game in Year One - they make fundamental mistakes, but they are quick to learn from them. 
 I found it to be an interesting stylistic choice to change the font between the narration portions of Gordon and Wayne...not so much because they changed the font, but because of the font that was used to Batman's internal dialogue. It was almost amusing to have a frame of a bloodied Batman...but with the narration written in a neat cursive font. While it does make the distinction that Bruce Wayne is of a more posh upbringing, it was also a bit ridiculous at times. 
 The art style of Year One is a bit rougher and simpler then that of Hush, but in many ways the way that Mazzucchelli chose to conserve his detail is even more impressive then if he has made every panel fully rendered. There are fewer lines on the faces to show expressions, yet with just a few marks, Mazzucchelli is able to convey the emotion and actions of the figures. 
 Thanks to the minimal inking style of Year One, the coloring job of this book very clearly shines through. The Richmond Lewis, the colorist of this story arc knew what he was doing when it comes to a limited palette, because most of the panels in this book were contained to two to four main colors per scene. This simple device has an immense impact on the atmosphere and mood of the various scenes. What I loved most about the coloring, and art in general, of this book was the texture that was present in almost every scene. The imperfect nature of the dry brushstrokes added an extra layer of energy to the already strong pencils of Mazzucchelli. 
 So my final verdict? Batman: Year One is a fantastic story with very high quality art that I would indeed recommend to most to read.""",2013-01-11 19:52:39,Batman: Year One,comics;graphic;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;fantasy;paranormal;young-adult,Frank Miller;David Mazzucchelli;Richmond Lewis;Dennis O'Neil

 There are somethings that happen at the end of book where I'll feel like screaming at Zoey, ""Stop acting so clueless! You already know what to do! You've done it before!"".

1966,59980,3,"""This week I've read Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Rises and Batman: Year One. I didn't especially enjoy either one, though that probably has as much to do with how I'm generally tired of superhero stories generally. There are graphic novels that I still enjoy--Ultimate Spider-Man, for example--but for the most part I'm weary of the constant barrage of superhero stories that pop culture currently throws at me. It's interesting to see the seeds of the current craze in Miller's stories, but I can't imagine ever reading either of these Batman stories again. My weariness of the current comics craze is explained in part by Year One illustrator David Mazzucchelli's comment (from the Afterword): 
 Once a depiction veers toward realism, each new detail releases a torrent of questions that exposes the absurdity at the heart of the genre. The more ""realistic"" superheroes become, the less believable they are. 
 I guess with all the recent movies that attempt to show superheroes as realistic, I'm just too tired of it all to invest much in Miller's stories. 
 Of the two books--Dark Knight and Year One--I enjoyed Year One much more. This is primarily because of the art style, which is much closer to the bold, vivid illustration that I prefer in graphic novels. Year One still uses the small TV screens, but only occasionally, and it doesn't become the annoying gimmick it is in Dark Knight. In fact, my enjoyment of Year One was enhanced after reading Mazzucchelli's Afterword, which I found quite thoughtful. Seeing his first comic page, drawn when he was a child, reminded me very much of my own kids and their developing art and storytelling skills. 
 Year One is a Batman origin story, but it's as much about Jim Gordon's story, which I liked. In this story, Gordon is a lieutenant, recently transferred to Gotham, and he has to navigate the corruption within the police department, as well as fight his own personal weaknesses. I was glad to see him making (eventually) wise choices. The story is a great set-up to the character. 
 As for Batman/Bruce's origin, there is less detail than I'd expected. Perhaps that's because the film Batman Begins has filled in those details so effectively (despite the film's occasional reliance on mindless action-movie scenes). At the end of Year One, there is still a lot of mystery about Bruce and his motivations, and where he is headed. But I suppose with a character like Batman, that's as it should be. 
 I found several of the villains difficult to distinguish, which was sometimes a problem. And though Catwoman/Selina appears, I wasn't quite sure why (but I don't know much about the classic Batman story, so I don't know what role she's required to play early on). If The Dark Knight Returns suffered slightly from having too many villains (and what actually happened to Harvey Dent, anyway?), Year One may have suffered from not having just one strong villain throughout. 
 I'm glad that I've now read two of the most popular Batman stories, but I think the world of Batman may not be the place for me.""",2014-06-18 22:29:25,Batman: Year One,comics;graphic;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;fantasy;paranormal;young-adult,Frank Miller;David Mazzucchelli;Richmond Lewis;Dennis O'Neil

 What is it with John Green and his masterpieces? How can one write books such as this, Looking for Alaska & The Fault in Our Stars.. What is the secret to writing books that aim for the heart of the person, and then shoot it down, not once, not twice, but endlessly. 
 This is probably the only John Green book with kind-of-a-happy-ending. No spoilers here. Just trying to make this more of a great ride for you because since I started reading this I kept waiting for the death part to come and steal my soul away. 
 The ending is sort of ambivalent. It's like a Christopher Nolan movie, the ending fucks you up. I choose to believe in the better version. I choose to believe that there was a happy ending, even if it was all in my head. I don't know how it's possible for me to want a happy ending when I'm a person who despises happy endings? That's something only John Green brings out in me. He makes me a happy-ending kind of person and that scares the hell out of me. 
 This was an amazing ride. I loved reading about Quentin & Margo. I loved that this had so much mystery, it was so unlike any other John Green novel. I loved it. The entire book was a mystery, up until the last pages. Even the last page is a mystery. Goddamn it, I just realized that & I want to strangle John Green. 
 This book is certainly strange. Quentin has always been crushing on Margo since they were little children and experienced something that was altogether horrid and scarring-for-life. I'm not going to say to you what has been haunting the both of them since they were little children. Figure it out on your own (I just let the John Green come out in me). 
 When Margo one day barges into his room, dressed as a ninja (yes, don't look at this twice, I said ninja) after years of not talking to him and tells him that she needs him to help her take revenge from everyone who's ever hurt her. One night, & then she'll never ever again bother him. She'll disappear. Quentin helps her (this is amazing by the way) and while he all finds it very strange he didn't think for a second that she'd stand true by her words and disappear. But disappeared she did and then he started discovering the clues that she had left for him to find her.

1974,14064,3,"""It's astonishing what Richard Matheson was able to do with mainly just one character in I Am Legend. Initially when I first picked up this novel, I attempted to remember Will Smith's 'I Am Legend' but failed to really remember anything and from what I've read it may just be my brain subconsciously blocking my memories of the sub-par movie. At first I pictured more of a zombie apocalypse, but I Am Legend follows Robert Neville, an army veteran, attempting to survive a vampire pandemic that has wiped out the world's population. 
 Neville is forced into a basic instinct survival mode of this crude world, while having to live with all of his loved ones being gone. Neville is a sympathetic protagonist who is torn between his emotions throughout the novel. Neville makes major advancements in protection from the vampires and their virus, but also seems to take leaps and bounds scientifically in an unrealistic amount of time. 
 As the book progresses, Neville sees that the roles have been reversed in the world and recognizes that he was the outsider, or as the title would incline, he was a legend of sorts. 
  When Robert Neville eventually meets Ruth, who Neville eventually finds out is infected with the vampire bacteria and was sent to spy on him, it is written perfectly by Matheson to lead you along with Neville and questions whether she is a living human or not. Matheson lures you in to sympathize with Ruth and become comfortable with her character until she knocks out Neville and runs away. Ruth is a part of a new society of living vampires who sought out Robert as he did to so many of his kind. Neville is then captured by this society and realizes that he was now the minority.  
 If it was not for Robert Neville's character carrying this novel, the story seemed a little weak to me. Once a sub-plot was introduced into the book, such as Neville's attempt to attract a canine companion, it was cut out of the story too soon. Notwithstanding the criticism, this is a classic science fiction novel to pick up for those who love post-apocalyptic stories.""",2013-07-28 18:45:28,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson

 First off, I want to say that I wanted to love this book, but I just didn't end up feeling that way. I love J. Daniels' books and I was excited for a new series from her, but Four Letter Word just didn't do it for me. It was well written but I had a hard time connecting with the characters. Initially, the storyline was interesting, but the way it played out and how the characters acted, it just didn't keep me engrossed. 
 Brian and Sydney ""meet"" when they are both in a crappy place in their lives. A phone call to the wrong number ends up with them talking to each other and sparking an interest to keeping talking to each other after the call has ended. The part that interested me the most in this book was the anticipation created before they met, knowing that they will meet soon and waiting for the meeting to happen. 
 Once Brian and Sydney finally met, I lost interest. While there were a couple things I was waiting to unfold, the storyline didn't play out in a way I enjoyed. I felt as if the book dragged on a bit more than I wanted. 
 Overall, I didn't love this book, but I hate it either--I'm in the middle. I did feel that this book was emotional and I felt for these characters with the situations that happened with them. I just wanted so much more from these characters. 
 I really ended up enjoying the side characters in this book, they were really interesting and they made me want to keep reading to see what they would do. Even though Four Letter Word didn't end up being my cup of tea, I'm intrigued by the characters that will be in Hit the Spot so I will be giving that a chance when it releases. ~ Leah, 3 Stars""",2016-10-01 18:24:26,"Four Letter Word (Dirty Deeds, #1)",romance;fiction,J.

 Stig Wyvern has plans--plans to chain himself up in his isolation chamber. He's about to enter the mating heat and he cannot be out in the open where his scent may be picked up by the Knights of St. George. Said plans do not include his dead best friend's sister showing up on his doorstep, needing a safe place to stay for the night. Because she is not safe--she's Stig's mate and damn, his Dragon is dying to escape and claim her. 
 Cora Cardenas has nowhere to go--nowhere to run, nowhere to hide other than with Stig. Stig made her promise to come to him when and if she ever needed him. Well, she's here now--and wow, Stig is just as hot and gorgeous as she remembers. 
 Stig knows he can't turn Cora away, but is he strong enough to protect her and himself during his heat cycle? How long until his Dragon breaks free and claims their mate? Unsuspecting Cora; will she turn and run when she finds out the truth, or will she be strong enough when push comes to shove and claim her place by Stig's side?

 Liking a book has a lot to do with the person reading it. The time, state of mind, and the experiences of the reader matters a lot. 
 And right now I think the romance genre might be dying for me. 
 This is by far not the fault of the book, and I totally only have myself to blame for picking this up when I know I am just not in the right mood for romance at the moment. 
 Objectively, it wasn't a bad book. It was heartwarming, it was bittersweet, it was sad and it was beautiful. The writing was solid, the characters were lovely and sweet and complex and not annoying. 
 But emotionally I just wasn't that invested. 
 Again, totally my fault. And three stars isn't necessarily bad, I just think younger me would have enjoyed this a bit more. Which is funny since this book is new adult, but it's a solid read for any lovers of the new adult genre!

1989,17950614,5,"""Neal Shusterman, thank you so much for blowing mind away. Let me start by saying that I recommend this series 100%. There are times where the books can seem slow, especially in UnSouled, but trust me it's totally worth it. Everything builds up to that one mind-shattering moment. Everything is just a side part to this bigger picture. The parts that may seem slow are actually paving the way for the story. 
 These books make you question your humanity, it gives you the large question of: Is unwinding all that bad? 
 At first I would have answered, yes completely. Those kids don't deserve what they got. And I still strongly believe that. Neal Shusterman provides you with the POV of both the unwinds and also the people who support unwinding. Which was genius because it's because of that that made second guess myself. I know it's crazy, but if I'm being completely honest, I don't know what I'd do. If I were in that life or death situation where I knew the only way to save myself was to accept an unwound part, would I accept? Would I, even knowing that that part came from a living human being who didn't deserve to be unwound. Would I still accept it? I'd still like to say no, that I wouldn't accept it, but there's a part of me that doesn't know, and won't know until I truly experience it. 
 You're constantly wondering if these events were to happen in real life whose side would you be on? If you were put into someone else's shoes, what would you do? And although it scared me, I loved every minute of it. There's a part in Undivided that makes me want to become a vegetarian because of what one character says, but I know I couldn't do it and that's what sickens me the most. 
 These books are haunting and always had me at the edge of my seat. Always had me questioning everything. There are like a hundred different villains in this series, some play a bigger part than others, but all of them are important. You never know who you can trust in this big bad world. You never know if you can even trust yourself. Good guys can turn bad. Bad guys can turn good. People you thought you could trust turn against you. I went into the last book thinking I knew who all the bad guys were, but oh was I so wrong. 
 Some of the bad character though truly believed that they were doing good (if that makes sense) and that's one of the main reasons that had me hating them even more. They were so selfish and twisted, but I loved every minute with their characters when I didn't want to strangle them. The villains were so brilliantly written and the multiple POV's helped you to understand their motives and what was going through their minds. And although I hated most of them I couldn't help but also feel sorry for them. 
 Connor, Risa, and Lev go through so much character development throughout the series. That's one of the reason why I all them so much, it feels like you're watching them grow up and you can't help but feel so proud of all their accomplishments or heartbroken when something bad happens to them. I connected with the characters so much that sometimes it was hard for me to continue reading because I knew something bad was going to happen to them and I couldn't do anything to stop it or help them. I could only read on. 
 My favorite character is Hayden, he brought the humor in all the dire situations. In one POV, we'll have someone in a drastic situation which will leave me nervous and scared for that characters life and then we'll switch to Hayden and he'll make me laugh, even when I don't want to laugh. My emotions were all over the place with these books. 
 There are multiple point of views in the Unwind series, Connor, Risa, and Lev are probably the main ones, but they most definitely are not the only ones. Every persons POV that Neal Shusterman adds has a purpose. They're all important and they all add to the story. The story wouldn't have been as good as it was without them. All of the characters were so different from each other, different personalities and they came from different backgrounds. And I applaud him for that because it's hard to create so many point of views and make all of them important while also making the characters different from one another. It's another reason why I love the Unwind series so much. Connor, Risa, Lev, Cam, they are all such different characters who come from different family backgrounds, but they were also so similar in many ways. All of them were fighting for that one goal: to get rid of unwinding. 
 I love all of the character so much, it's going to be so hard to let them go. But I'm so proud of each and every one of them. 
 Literally one of the best series I've read in such a long time. I love it so much. Amazing job Neal Shusterman, you are a genius and you seriously deserve a medal for this masterpiece. These books seriously need more hype and more people need to read it! This series is the kind that will stay with me for a very long time. I doubt there will be anything like it, it's truly one of a kind. 
 Amazing ending as well, it ties up most loose ends, however I still wish we got a little bit more. But amazing overall.

For whatever reason -- and this isn't really covered in depth, which actually kind of makes sense to me -- Alex decides that he wants to free her intelligence and make her truly sentience. He hasn't really thought about it before, even though he's all wired up to his house, but it just feels right, so he goes through with it. 
 And that's... pretty much it. It's an intriguing enough set-up, but it's barely the start of a story. I wish the library had the next book; I'd rather just go straight onto that, and hope that it picks up straight away. As it is, I'm not sure when I'll get to read the second volume.

 I did find it interesting that despite the medieval-ish setting, the main character, Katsa, is allowed so much agency. Then again, it's not a thing she's accorded as a right. Just because she's strong and can fight doesn't mean she can escape from being prettied up, from having people insist on her getting married, etc. Thankfully, the book isn't unaware of this, but it feels like it focuses mainly on the point of marriage, as if marriage can never be an equal partnership and is to be avoided at all costs. I didn't like the handling of marriage at all in the book. It's just fine with me if someone doesn't want their fantasy heroine to get married, but if there's going to be so much of a point made of it, I'd prefer there was actually a good reason. The idea of loss of freedom was barely explored, it was just played as A Bad Thing. In one way I'm glad there's a fantasy book out there where the main character is female and has a relationship without it ending up in stereotypical marriage and happily ever after. In another, it just felt like it was, well, to borrow internets vocab, ""pastede on yay"". 
 That's partially because I didn't feel the characters that much, either. I never felt all that invested in the characters, so even when one of them goes blind, which is normally one of my big buttons, I didn't really care. Katsa should be an interesting character, hopefully a likeable one, and Po definitely both. But I couldn't muster up much care, I think because we kept being told how awesome they both are. I'd rather form that opinion myself, thanks. I don't like it when people write by checklist, bolting on faults, but did Katsa have any faults? I suppose that she was blunt, perhaps that she was unfeminine if that's a fault from your perspective. Inclined to not thinking things through. But we don't see any consequences of her faults -- everything turns out just fine for her. And Po... I guess his conceit is a fault, but again. Everything turns out fine. Bitterblue is a strange character: she's meant to be ten years old, but she doesn't act it. There are reasons for that, but it's still a thing that bugged me while reading. 
 There were definitely bits of it that I liked. Katsa's dislike of mindreading was something I identified with. The idea of mindreading creeps the hell out of me, actually. The way she dealt with it irritated me a little, but it was still interesting and a good idea. I liked the idea of Graces, and that the two main characters' Graces were not straight forward. That's another two-edged sword, though, because Katsa and Po just get more and more special as the book goes on. Katsa's indestructible -- the one thing that counters her Grace, the one thing that might beat her, and she manages to beat it anyway. Bad things happen to Po, but it doesn't matter, he has his Grace. 
 It was quite fun, for a single read, and I might give it to my sister because I'm pretty sure she'd enjoy the kickass heroine. If you want a fantasy heroine who kicks ass and takes names, Katsa's definitely a good choice, and I doubt the things that bugged me about it would bug everyone -- far from it. I can definitely see the appeal for teenage girls. I don't think I'll be reading the prequel or the sequel, unless I spot them in the library or something.""",2009-05-24 02:24:15,"Graceling (Graceling Realm, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;romance;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Kristin Cashore
1992,14975,3,"""I enjoyed reading Kate Mosse's Labyrinth quite a lot. It reminded me rather of The Da Vinci Code, but it was somewhat better researched, and rich with detail. Normally the two story threads separated by time would annoy me, but I did find it interesting in this case. I preferred the thirteenth century thread, with Alais, to be honest: the modern part was what reminded me most of The Da Vinci Code, with the secret society chasing her down and murders/sacrifices happening and... The thirteenth century part seemed, well, more realistic. 
 I felt that the writing/editing was better at the beginning of the book. Toward the end, you had massive sections of time filled in by another character telling the story. Boooring. 
 The end is not surprising, in the slightest. The epilogue feels rather tacked on and rushed: wrapping things up without really caring for telling more story.

 This. Was. INSANE! By the end, I was feeling ALL of the feelings! 
 I do have a couple small complaints though. There was a lot going on. We went back and forth through a lot of different perspectives. It didn't really affect me in any of the other books but in this one it was a bit much for me. Next issue, a few relationships. Specifically  Lev and Miracolina and Cam and Una. We had some build up for Lev and Miracolina in UnWholly but we got NOTHING from her in UnSouled and then BAM, she's back after Lev wakes up after being shot? And their reunion was like three pages long. Admittedly, her giving him a kidney definitely solidifies their bond but I wanted MORE. And when asked if they are actually in a relationship Lev is like yeah, I guess. It's long distance, it's complicated. As for Cam and Una, their obvious connection is Wil's hands but other then that? I don't ship them. Sorry not sorry! I feel like they are both trying to fill holes that Risa and Wil left in them.  
 Other than those gripes, this was a great conclusion to the series. Full of twists and turns and surprises and FEELS. Though I think this was a good end and it wrapped up the majority of the character's stories, I still have a few questions.  Why didn't Grace reunite with them? What happened to Bam and the rest of the storks? What does Cam do with all the rewinds?  These aren't huge issues but I'm curious enough to want a novella or something maybe a few months later?""",2015-06-18 21:10:28,"UnDivided (Unwind, #4)",young-adult;fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime;romance,Neal Shusterman

 I liked reading about a world where people knew werewolves existed and consider ""lupine syndrome"" a disease. I'm really curious to know what the camps they send them to are like. 
 The first half of this book was pretty slow, the rest of it was good. Secrets were flying out left and right and soooo many werewolves are revealed!

 I found the characters slightly annoying as well. Kvothe goes from ""Oh, woe is me"" one minute to being arrogant the next. I get that my be intentional, but so annoying. Denna.. Oh Denna, she is so self involved it made me a bit mad. Lastly Ambrose, can someone please punch him in the face?

1998,8262550,5,"""Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold was completely unexpected. It's one of those stories that touches your heart, and has you thinking about the characters for days to come. 
 I really didn't think this author was gonna be able to pull it off, being that they both agree to a marriage and are amicable to each other before twenty percent, and this was a long book. I can't stay invested in an everyday relationship--there has to be tension between the characters, not just plot-wise. But I was so wrong. I absolutely loved this story. 
 I think I fell in love with the hero the moment he opened his mouth and said, ""Mornin'."" Seriously. He was a dark-edged character who's vitality literally radiated off the pages. And he's definitely made it to my Hero Hall of Fame list. 
 The moment I started this book, I couldn't stop reading. It begins right away with Anne the heroine on the run from her father who's trying to force her to marry some despicable man. It so happens to be the hero's hay she's sleeping in. She didn't know Cord lived there, but she's known him vaguely for being the half-Indian man with a violent streak. 
 So while they get on amicably pretty soon, there is so much more to this story than that. Their relationship built over time was heart-warming and so true to a budding romance. I loved every minute of it. 
 My heart hurt so much for Cord and the prejudice he went through being a half-breed in a white man's world. The cool thing about him, though, was that he was a man in every sense of the word. He handled the hate without a care in the world. He was true to himself, and while he thought Anne could do better than him, it wasn't because of the color of his skin, but because of the backlash she'd receive from society. It was great to see how tough someone could remain with all that hate thrown at them. 
 Anne was a white woman, and while she was looked down on for marrying Cord, she never let the hate get to her. I was rooting for her often when she'd call someone out or stand up for Cord. And I was so emotionally invested in this story that I'd feel offended myself; it sucked me in completely. 
 The plot was perfection; it kept me invested over FOUR HUNDRED pages. And while the story could use a good editor, it didn't detract me much from the story. 
 Ellen O'Connell wrote a story about a forbidden love in an already hateful world. Full of human relationships, that true kind of love that exists beyond infatuation, and life in the 1800's, Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold was a fabulous tale that I won't soon forget.""",2017-02-27 17:33:40,"Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold (Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold, #1)",history;historical fiction;biography;romance;fiction,Ellen O'Connell

 By any other name would smell as sweet."" 
 Romeo and Juliet, Act 2 Scene 2 
 By Any Other Name is a fantastic mafia rendition of Romeo & Juliet. The vibe of the story was the perfect feel of a forbidden love, and a family who wants nothing more than their rival dead. 
 The heat between Matty and Genny was palpable, and the tension of them being found out had my stomach in knots. 
 While it felt on the edge of insta, I was still really invested. And I didn't mind so much because this was based on Romeo & Juliet, who are the definition of insta. I mean, didn't they get married the day after they met? The conflict of Matty and Genny being found out kept me completely entranced, even if I craved some stronger push and pull. They jumped into their relationship just like Romeo & Juliet--well, minus the marriage. 
 The Galantes and the Barsantis are two of the five mafia families in New York. In the prologue, there's the death of one Galante son, and the feud begins. 
 ""The only good Barsanti is a dead Barsanti,"" he'd said. ""You see one, you run the other way."" 
 I think the thing I loved about this story was that my heart hurt for both sides. I sympathized with both of them, and didn't want either to lose. The conflict of their families finding out and the suspense of what would happen, had my heart racing more than once. 
 But with a feud, there are deaths. And there were. No family got out unscathed. 
 Oh, Matty. Don't get me started on him. I'm not a lover of sweet heroes. God, but there was just something about him that I LOVED. He wasn't too sweet and a pushover. No, he was perfectly made. 
 ""I risk coming here, because one of us has to take that risk. One of us has to be willing to take the chance."" 
 He was one-hundred percent real. He could exist in this human world where us romance lovers want to believe there are 6'4 perfectly sculpted men roaming around. He was courageous, devoted to the women in his life, charismatic, and so in love with Genny. 
 The relationship between the characters was one of my favorites. Especially the two families' rivalry. I don't know why, maybe this is a cavewoman thing, but I kinda love to see two men fight. Or maybe that's a psychotic thing? Don't know. 
 ""If she were a delicate ice sculpture, this stunning man was a strong marble statue."" 
 Yes, I did feel there was a little insta. But they were off the charts together. Their chemistry flew off the pages, and their first moment was damn hot. I loved them as a couple and thought they complimented each other nicely. 
 I'm not a lover of third person, and the story was written that way. It felt a little distant, and it was often annoying as I was reading. I kept getting confused on who ""he"" was and which ""she"" they were talking about. A personal preference for me, and a slight thing that I didn't enjoy. 
 The chemistry between the characters was spot on, the family rivalry was suspenseful and nerve-wracking, and the emotions flew off the pages. I loved the forbidden Romeo & Juliet theme, and the passion between Matty and Genny. If you like mafia, forbidden love, and sweet heroes, then definitely give this one a try.""",2016-09-08 05:51:13,"By Any Other Name (Forbidden, #1)",romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,J.M.

2000,186074,4,"""I enjoyed every individual moment of reading this book. The writing is exceptional, striking the right balance between beauty and clarity. The magic system stands out from typical vague fantasy handwaving, and has a few moments of being nicely woven into the story. The setting has interesting aspects; I even liked some of the nerdy tangents that explore the everyday systems--debt, academia politics, library filing systems--that are rarely touched on, but should be a part of any realistic fantasy world. Best of all is the painfully relatable portrayal of awkward first-time teenage love, riddled with doubt and confusion. 
 Where it falls apart a bit is when taking a step back and looking at the story as a whole. Individual scenes have arcs and tension, but rarely contribute to an overall story. Similarly, the main character starts as an infallible child prodigy and becomes a slightly older infallible child prodigy. It's partly intentional, but a cocky character who can do no wrong doesn't always make the best protagonist to root for. Other characters come and go with little rhyme or reason other than to briefly bounce off Kvothe. The one exception doesn't show up until halfway through the book. That's also when a plot seems to start revealing itself, but even then it's a false start, causing the whole book to feel like a series of unresolved prologues rather than a complete story. Which is annoying for a book that is so damn long. 
 Maybe some of the hanging plot threads will be resolved in the sequels. I'm just not sure I can spend months (shut up, I read slow) reading another book to find out. 
 Still, I can't give less than 4 stars to a book that is so beautifully written and with so many moments of brilliance.""",2015-02-11 16:03:50,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 In the novella, Robert is a southern California factory worker. I was living (at the time Matheson wrote the book) in a neighborhood like this, and people really did think that gaining an education (enough to cure a disease that had baffled a world of scientists) was something any tough-minded factory worker might take on with reasonable expectations of success. What I liked most about the book (you see a little in Omega Man, but none in the Will Smith version) is the ambiguity of the vampire/zombie as a moral agent/patient. 
 It's hard to sustain a long narrative--even a novella like this--with a single, fleshed-out character; some of the inner dialog and parts of the plotline (trying to tame the stray dog) become tedious.

2004,21853680,3,"""I have a lot of feelings about this collection of essays. I knew going in that I would probably disagree with some/many of the contentions, but that's also why I read it. I have wanted to be a mom for so long that not wanting it is unfathomable. But I wanted to try to understand. 
 I really appreciated the authors that took a sober, clear-eyed (and often gut-wrenching) look at their choices. I can appreciate someone who has made a hard choice- the one that is best for them even though it hurts. I can sympathize with someone who suffers from depression and feels unable to add the reponsibility of a child to their life. 
 But I was frankly frustrated and (sometimes disgusted) by the authors that approached their essays flippantly. The author who casually had her third abortion because she didn't want to cart a baby with her on the train to visit her partner who was currently living in a different city. The author who wrote off all mothers as followers and celebrated her own liberation from society's tyranny. And the authors who just didn't want to be bothered with the mess and endless, inane conversations that small children require. Obviously, these are all reasons not to have a child, but they are the ""selfish and self-absorbed"" ones of the title. I was hoping for deeper philosophy. 
 But perhaps even that expectation is unfair. The decision to have children isn't always a well-rationalized choice (or even a pre-arranged decision). Each author is entitled to whatever reason (or lack thereof) they want for the state of their life. I just felt sad for those who didn't want to have kids because it seemed too hard or too much of an inconvenience. What a shallow life we would all lead if every choice was made with the priority of maximizing our current happiness.""",2015-06-13 11:41:22,"Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on The Decision Not To Have Kids",non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;children,Meghan Daum;Kate Christensen;Tim Kreider;Paul Lisicky;M.G.

The main character is the Mary Sue-ingest Mary Sue that ever Mary Sue-d, and even when he does speak critically of himself it's transparent humble-braggery, so that was tough at times. BUT, I have not read a lot of fantasy, and the coworker who recommended this to me positioned this quality as a really smart send-up of traditional fantasy/heroic narratives, so maybe it's that. I was also put off by the dearth of female characters, and how much the physical appearance of female characters is lingered on. Seriously, I think the first time Denna is introduced the narrator spends like 5 pages in this ""how do I describe her beauty?"" swamp while poor Denna waits on the pedestal. My coworker argues that is also part of the genre-satire Rothfuss is engaging in, though, and she's definitely smarter about it than I.

2011,22642971,3,"""* Originally posted on Books and Starlight * 
 * This book was given to me from the author as part of the blog tour in an exchange of an honest review. * 
 God help me, green is my least favorite color on the whole world, but somehow I love this cover. It actually captures the book's dreamlike feeling, and the actual dreams that are a big part of Ella's life. I love those butterflies and the silhouette is so beautiful. 
 First of all, this was my first book I read from Beth Revis, since I haven't had a chance to meet with her Across The Universe series, even though that one is on my tbr since forever probably. So I was a Beth Revis virgin until The Body Electric. 
 I found it a bit hard in the beginning to get into this story. There were a lot of world descriptions that I found really long and maybe half of it would have been enough. But the world actually was really nice and I loved the essence of it. The world building was really nice, little details at a time, so we didn't get overwhelmed with it. I loved the technology and all these futuristic nanobots and androids and everything else this dystopian world came with. I always wonder when I read a book like this or watch movies with upper technology, that if they can imagine, why can't they make it real? I would totally love to live in a futuristic city. 
 The storyline actually wasn't the most original, because you know, corrupt government, rebels and whatnot.. we've seen this before but it doesn't mean the book was any less enjoyable. There was quite an action in it, which I love in books. 
 I loved the writing style too - except those long descriptions - it was very easy to read and follow through. There weren't any metaphors or poetic style writing, or words I didn't understand or had to look up in the dictionary, so this was really positive for me. 
 What I had most of my problem were the characters. The main characters I couldn't connect with and the minor ones weren't really that big part of the book. Ella was a bit distant for me and somehow, seemed indifferent, yet she was more real than the characters I've read lately and that was what I found the main reason I kept reading it. Jack was another story, I think I just couldn't get to know him at all. I found their romance a bit lacking too and for me, romance is very important in books, otherwise I can't enjoy them as much. 
 While it didn't become a favorite of mine, I think I am going to do a re-read when I finally get to read Across The Universe, because I've heard there are quite some Easter Eggs in it from that series. And if you didn't know before: I LOVE EASTER EGGS. Those are my favorite EVERYWHERE. I live for them. So yeah, I am definitely going to read The Body Electric again. 
 I would recommend this book to lovers of science fiction, who doesn't mind that all of it is summed up in one book - since this is a stand-alone novel - and doesn't mind a focus being more on the world that on romance.""",2014-11-30 15:17:40,The Body Electric,young-adult;fiction;romance;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Beth Revis

If you don't have the ""Mark"" you can't get a job or buy stuff, and people can't help you either, so you're pretty much guaranteed to be homeless and live a life of crime in order to survive.

Like Bruno and Guy's sick relationship, it was hard to stay away even though I knew I had to. When I restarted, I only stopped when I reached the last page. What a journey.

 I feel like the character of Scarlett wasn't as much developed as I'd like. Her personality is full, but it's harder to get into her mind and heart and understand. 
 I hated Juliet. Plain and simple. She was just annoying and selfish. I just couldn't tolerate her. 
 Hayden was a great character. He was funny, light, and just a well rounded character. He was one of the most developed characters in this book, but I didn't feel like I liked him with Scarlett OR Juliet. 
 Jesse was completely one dimensional. He felt more like a shadow, than a real person. And so was the rest of the characters. 
 Overall I feel like the characters in this book were a little on the see-through side, personality wise (if that makes any sense..sorry..), but the plot has plenty of potential to be even more poignant and inspiring. This book definitely was enjoyable, somewhat light, and warm. I recommend this to people who like Sarah Dessen.

 I really liked the circumstances of how he grew up. His family  of troupers were great people, and his mentor Abenathy was such an interesting guy. I do wonder what happened to Abenathy, and whether or not he was killed (he heard the song of Lanre as well)! The whole story of how Kvothe grew up in a loving family of troupers but ended up stuck in Tarbean was so tragic. His struggles to stay in University were quite compelling, and I liked that he had to work for it. 
 His love of music was so tangible. The part where he spent weeks/months just after his family's death just playing the lute was so sad. I was so happy for him when he got his talent pipes (which is an interesting tidbit to have in the story imo). 
 One of my favourite parts was when the people from village at the inn start to talk about Kvothe, and the stories they tell are wildly different from what actually happened. It's great. Although I found these parts, where they are in the ""present"" to be the weakest parts of the story. Stop trying to explain stuff to Chronicler (and thus us).

 This was a solid 4 until the story started giving scientific explanations for the vampirism that I'm sure sounded more solid in 1954 (""body glue"" and ""I'm immune because I was bitten by a vampire bat"" in particular ) and jumped ahead in time and began relying on exposition to explain what happened during the gap. I really would have preferred to have seen those discoveries fleshed out, though I suppose that might have run the risk of becoming redundant. (Or would greater detail of Neville's experiments have been too perverse for the 50s? The major character development points had already been achieved with his ventures outside of the house, visiting his wife's tomb, the dog, his stormy start into educating himself. So I can see why a year of cold scientific experimentation might have been an unpopular and grotesque prospect. ) 
 I felt the story was executed solidly until that point and was able to recoup some lost points from its ending. Robert Neville is a troubled man who is very hard to like and I appreciate that approach, particularly from an era where I'm sure antiheroes were far from the norm. Moments used to highlight his (faltering) grasp on his humanity were spot-on (notably: the dog ). 
 The perspective twist is absolutely brilliant, even going into the story knowing what ""I am legend"" means. 
 Save for that wacky bit of mid-20th century science, I Am Legend is vey good and worthy of the legacy it has spawned. It's always a pleasure to read one of these cornerstone pieces of fiction and, from my modern perch, recognize themes and elements that are now ubiquitous in literature and movies, and still be impressed.""",2014-09-20 17:30:34,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson

 So I had some problems getting into this book. I read around the first third and then set it down for 2 weeks. I don't know why I just wasn't in the mood for the story. But then I picked it back up and finished it in one night. I love it. I think the story is beautiful. Ed, the man who starts receiving these cards, starts to see the beauty in others and in life. 
 My favorite was the family he gave new lights to. It shows just how simply you can impact others. And that is the same case with the ice cream cone. Ed did such simple acts, but they had such an impact on those people. I think it just shows how important being good to each is. 
  The ending was interesting. I am unsure if I wanted him to leave the cards a surprise or say who was sending the cards. It is revealed that is is Markus Zusak who is the one sending him the cards. I think it plays along into the theme. Like Ed not only impacted these people but he impacted us, he left something with the reader. That his story was the message meant for us. I like it because that is reading. Reading is ending a book with gaining something, and that is always different. But at the end of every story there is message and the book is the messenger.

Going into this I was expecting something like the excellent The Devil You Know or The Dead List what I got instead was just a big disappointment. This felt like two separate books; one being the horror/thriller part and the other being the contemporary/romance part. 
 The Thriller The first two killings were good. It was creepy and I loved being in the victims heads however, this was the only bright spot. The victims had no connection to the main character so it's hard to care about their deaths. We find out the killer is halfway through, not in a it's so obvious way but in the we are told way. There was nothing creepy or scary about a killer who has been identified killing characters who mean nothing in over gory ways. 
 The Romance This also fell flat for me. Makani is an interesting character. She's bi racial and her divorcing parents shipped her off to Nebraska from her native Hawaii. I wished Perkins has spent time delving into Makani's culture shock and her residual anger at her parents and friends from Hawaii. Instead we spend the majority of this book reading about make out sessions between her and Ollie, the mysterious boy with pink hair and piercings. Their was zero chemistry with this couple. They have previously hooked up and had sex before the start of the book and at the beginning of the book they aren't speaking to each other because each thinks the other is ignoring them. They quickly work past it and get together. Maybe the problem was that there was no angst or tension in regards to them getting together.

2026,18745159,5,"""The Elemental Assassin series is an Urban Fantasy set in the fictional town of Ashland where corruption runs rampant and vampires, dwarfs, giants, and elemental magic wielders are all common place. In Poison Promise, Gin Blanco, main character and certified badass elemental assassin wielding the powers of stone and ice, is trying to get things back to normal after her latest bout of assassinating (I don't want to say straight up murder, because these people kind of had it comin'- but yeah, she kills a lot of people. Be warned) and struggling to get over the recent loss of a loved one. But there's no rest for the wicked; even though Gin killed the old Big Bad Bosswoman of Ashland's underworld, ten more crime lords are standing in line to take her place and they all seem to be gunning for Gin. One of these is vampire drug lord Beauregard Benson (I love that name) who's willing to do anything to cement his bid for the throne - including releasing a potent new drug called ""Burn"" onto the streets and coming after people Gin cares about. 
 Poison Promise is the 11th book in the Elemental Assassin series and the first one I've read. Stepping into this universe at the eleventh hour, so to speak, one would think I'd be completely lost - but I wasn't at all. From fairly early on the author does a fabulous job of letting the reader know the key events that have gone down in the series so far and who all the important players are (including physical descriptions and how they're connected to the main character). This ""catching up"" was well done and didn't feel heavy handed to me at all and I really appreciated the effort. 
 The first part of the book is pretty much establishing the who's and what's of the series so far and setting up to the main meat of the story. When the important stuff goes down (around the halfway point) everything comes together and events hit hard and fast, an exhilarating, action-packed ride culminating in the requisite showdown. The last part of the book basically sets up for the next book (Black Widow coming out November 2014). 
 I loved the main character in this (but we all know about my love of badass chicks, so of course I loved her). The thing that made Gin Blanco such a standout character to me was that she isn't just an assassin. She's a sister, a friend, a business owner/ restaurateur (She owns and operates the Pork Pit - a barbecue joint that sounds delicious), and a fantastic cook (there's a scene where she makes sloppy joes that can pretty much be used as a step-by-step how to recipe). The secondary characters are pretty interesting as well - they had great names and unique traits, like her foster brother Finnegan Lane, an investment banker who's also a very talented sniper. 
 With great characters and an addictive storyline I'll be sure to catch the next book in the series - I may check out some of the older books as well if I come across them since after reading this one I'm pretty confident I could pick up any book in the series and dive right in.

2027,38568,1,"""I start this book thinking maybe it will be cute. The description of the book describes the main character Lissianna as a vampire with a tendency to faint at the site of blood. Silly, but not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Dr. Gregory Hewitt is a psychiatrist who wakes up in Lissianna's bedroom tied up and she wants a bite. Interesting enough to be put on my to-be-read pile anyways. 
 So I start reading it. Lissianna comes from a family of vampires. Her parents, siblings, and friends are all vampires too. It's also her 202nd birthday. She's had some bad luck finding some good food, and arrives early at her mothers for her birthday party. Vampire birthday party. That was strike number one. So she goes up to her room and finds Dr. Gregory all tied up and sexy and decides to open up her present early. She gets interrupted by her mother explaining that the present wasn't for eating, but for curing her phobia with blood. Lissianna sulks and heads back down to the party like a chastised child. That was strike two. The party winds down later and Lissianna and her friends and family are downstairs. All of the females are described as in pastel colored baby doll outfits. Oooookay. The vampires then all gather around asking what do you do at a pajama party. When someone explains they all try to decide which to do first. Should they tell scary stories? Gossip about boys? Riiiiiight. So that would be strike three. 
 I don't require vampires in stories to be full of angst or anything like that but a vampire pajama party sorta crosses the line for me. She's supposed to be 202 years old for goodness sake.

2031,4507203,3,"""Ravenous is the epitome of a middle-of-the-road book. It's an entertaining read, but not one I'd jump to recommend. 
 Classified as paranormal romance, Ravenous follows the structure of that genre, but also includes plenty of urban fantasy elements and will probably appeal to readers on that side of the subgenre divide. The central characters, Holly (a witch) and Alessandro (a vampire), fall in love while trying to prevent a demon from wreaking havoc in their city. Sharon Ashwood tells the story in third person, with the point of view alternating between Holly, Alessandro, and occasional others. 
 Ashwood's best touch is probably the witch houses. In this universe, when a witch family lives in a house, the building absorbs a great deal of power and becomes partially sentient. We see two examples in the novel: one benevolent and one gone horribly wrong. Another fun aspect is the snarky humor: 
 Eternal life didn't make a person anything besides old. The real value lay in what you did with all that time. As far as he could tell, most immortals wasted that opportunity on internal politics and fashion crimes. 
 On the other hand, the characters could have used more fleshing-out, as could the relationship between the leads. Holly and Alessandro initially meet and establish a friendship offscreen, before Ravenous begins, so we don't get to see the formation of that bond. Instead, most of the development is sexual. One terrific exception is the scene where Holly calls Alessandro for comfort after dispatching a human-sized mouse, and he comes to her rescue even though he thinks she means a garden-variety rodent. This is one moment when the emotional connection between the characters really comes through. I'd have loved to see more moments like that. In addition, everything seems to fall into place a little too easily at the end. 
 Also disappointing is the revelation of the bad guy who orchestrated the demon summoning. This character, who had previously appeared complex, reveals himself as a one-note zealot willing to sacrifice anyone for his cause. He's much more interesting, though, as he first appears -- a well-meaning but weak man who lets his fears get the better of him.

 (Brain: No one's askin' you, Pri! 
 Me: ... 
 Me: Shut up, Brain!) 
 Leave it to Hitchcock to find such little gems, especially in their obscurity, while others deemed it to be ""just a silly story"". (Raymond Chandler's words, not mine!) 
 Now, why am I talking about Hitchcock? It's because of him that I found this perfect embodiment of- what is popularly known as- psychological thrillers. Simply put- it contains everything you expect in this genre. A villain with little or no sense of normalcy? Check!; An actual crime? Check! Conflict of guilt? Double check! A turning point? CHECK CHECK all the fuckin' CHECKS!! 
 *takes deep breaths* 
 *drinks water* 
 Sorry, got a li'l excited back there! 
 Anyway, let's get to the story. 
 Bruno and Guy meet on a train, and Guy reluctantly shares about his dislike for his wife who- although, separated- is refusing to divorce him. And Bruno, with an ardor for crime fiction, divulges how much he dislikes his father, and he further imparts one of his schemes for a perfect murder(where, both swipe their respective victims so that no one will suspect their motive to the crime, and hence cannot be linked). Guy, who bears all the world's morals on his shoulders (Oh, Guy!), refuses to be pulled into it and leaves. And so the drama ensues. 
 Well, you know how inevitable it is, that the morally rigid are the one who always break easily. 
 You must dissect the characters when it comes to psychological dramas 
 When you look at Bruno and Guy, you really begin to appreciate how- for the lack of a better word- jumbled Highsmith's characters are. 
 Bruno has the emotional maturity of a five-year-old and criminal mentality of fifty. One who thinks everyone not in favor with his thoughts are the enemies(just like an adorable five year old), and yet, plans to murder them all the same. He hates his father, but there never is specific reason as to why. He claims his mother hates him, too, but, she never expresses her hate anywhere in the book. Clearly, it's all in his head. 
 About Guy, now you might say, Guy?? Why Guy?? Guy is perfectly innocent!! But, is he, though? Do you think Guy's affinity towards Bruno- even though, he knows Bruno is a sociopath- is out of ""innocence""?? Do you think his reason for his ""deed"" as self-defense is justified?? He is just as bad as Bruno. All that conflicts he faces when Bruno murders Miriam, do you think he kept quiet because he was afraid of Bruno?? Everything Bruno feels towards Guy, Guy feels it towards Bruno, too. This book is the mother of all homo-erotic subtexts(don't you get me started on that!!). He was equally selfish, he just didn't want to reciprocate! 
 Not just the story 
 There were some bits woven into the story that I found very amusing. 
 For example, when Bruno muses over how he should ""take a rocket to moon"". This book was written in 1950, whereas, the Apollo 11 mission(the first time man landed on moon) happened in 1969(umm, if I'm not wrong). 
 And the casual mention of Abortion. I liked how Guy didn't make a big fuss on when Miriam had her abortion. Neither did Bruno, when he found out. 
 I liked how Guy is an architect, unlike in movie where he was a Tennis player. More believable.

2043,10806009,4,"""Where to start? This book was really nothing like I thought it would be, especially with an ending that totally surprised me. I was not expecting that heartbreak to happen. The author did a stellar job as to keeping me in the dark about how the big mystery was finally solved. 
 So, Anna Leemann plays the flute and is a senior. She's a smart and quiet young girl that's very inexperienced with boys. But, Abel Tannatek piques her interest. The boy with the black knit cap always covering his blonde hair waits every day outside school by the bikerack. The rumor swirling around is that he is a drug dealer - ""the Polish Peddler"". But, unsuspecting behind those ice-blue eyes, is a dark and disturbing past that will have devastating results to those that dare to try to mess with Abel's will to protect his younger sister, Misha. Misha is a six year-old girl that is just so sweet and trusting. And, most of all, she trusts Abel to take care of her and provide for her even though he's only seventeen. She thinks that when he becomes eighteen on March 13th, everything will be ""okay"". But, before that time approaches, Abel's life has spun so far out of control that there is only one solution to protect Misha, and then his obligation to provide for her will be fulfilled. 
 It's a sad and dark novel filled with tragedy, mystery, and love. I really didn't know where the author was leading me - oftentimes down a deeply painful scene. The setting, which took place in Germany, was very dismal and depressing during the winter season. A perfect setting during a sinister and gothic-like novel. The supporting characters, which were somewhat shady and questionable, had me guessing as to where their true loyalties lay. 
 Along with the actual present story being told, is Abel's ability to create a fairytale that mystically depicts the current storyline. He tells this tale to young Misha, and Anna listens as well. The story is riddled with imaginitive make-believe characters that both mesmerizes and surprises the two girls - Misha because she is so infatuated with her older brother and Anna because she is so attracted and intrigued by the blonde-haired blue-eyed ruffian. 
 As the mystery to who is killing people that have had some tie to Abel and Misha comes to its climax, Anna doesn't want to believe that Abel has anything to do with it. But, everything seems to point to him, and he's also so protective of his little sister - just trying to keep her with him so he knows that she'll always be taken care of. This was a novel of tragedy and hopelessness that inflicted pain and suffering on young innocent children who were just trying to make sense of a cruel and heartbreaking world. Both main characters were courageous and smart while putting the ones they loved first before themselves.

 What is geek love? 
 I entered this book with no idea what I was getting myself into. Only that I'd heard so much about it and that it was oh so good, I thought I might as well get in on it. Although it was written in 1989, it found itself back in the limelight after Dunn's death back in May. Might as well find out what this book has to offer. 
 First thing's first: there were many issues that I had with the book, that I still do now. I enjoyed the story of the Binewskis and their tale as spoken from our main character, Oly. But the parts of story that bookend at the beginning and end (and somewhere in the middle too?) were a little confusing. I had to reread certain sections because I was not sure what time period I was in. Alas, after some finagling, I figured it out. Unfortunately, I was uninterested in that part of the story, and found the ending to be a little flat. I felt a little removed from the experience at the end with the death of Oly and Miss Lick because of the writing itself. Maybe it's supposed to be creative and experimental with the way some of it was edited? I don't know. But if I have to reread a death scene to understand it, that may not always be a good thing. With that said, the final chapter was poignant and concise with a great sense of depth. It's the ending that I think would make this book club worthy. 
 One aspect about Geek Love that I really loved were the characters. Many of them, I loved to hate. Two of them (Oly and Chick), I hated that I loved them. Contrasting feelings in the reader makes for a really great read and a good sense of the book hangover. They are complicated characters who are much more than their physical features, which is the fascinating part. Here you have Dunn who goes over the features of what the characters look like, what makes them special and unique. Then, it's their personalities that really define who they are. 
 Overall, I found that I enjoyed this book. It had great characters and an intriguing story. However, I doubt that I'll ever enjoy it as much as it's probably due. If you like dark and twisted stories with sprinkles of levity throughout, then check this one out.""",2014-10-08 21:44:26,Geek Love,fiction;fantasy;paranormal,Katherine Dunn

2055,186074,1,"""The Me from one year ago became pretty excited when he'd read this book's description, especially when he'd seen that The Name of the Wind had one of the highest ratings on the site (even after so many people had given their scores). 
 And now I am yet again sore and sad after finally finishing it (I should have listened to Keely and the other 1 star reviews...). Recently, I watched an interview of Patrick R.'s, in which the man claimed to have read nothing but fantasy for a very long span of childhood, and thereafter called upon the vastness of the knowledge gained on the dos and don'ts of the genre when he became spurred on to write a fantasy of his own design (or so I'd assumed with hope). While I do share his view that a lot of fantasy out there doesn't step out of the popular comfort zone (which is certainly a tough undertaking), it seems--and this is simply an educated guess--that Rothfuss, having read so much of the sameness he wanted to stray from, ended up including a trove of recycled concepts in spite of himself, or maybe some purposefully, but just in a more altered formula. 
 Rothfuss points out that you need investment in characters, which I also agree with (although it is a situational thing--a book may be able to make up for lacking character development in different ways). But worst of all that was included in The Name of the Wind is certainly the red-headed main character, Rand al'Thor's long-lost foil-brother from Wheel of Time. One of Rothfuss's major blunders is having the pompous and too-good-to-be-true main character named Kvothe--or Kote, or Reshi, or Kingkiller, Bloodless, etc.--may his names never end-- tell his story and build himself up right from the outset as this incredible person who is amazing at everything they do and must constantly inform you that they are, assuming you're extremely forgetful or unable to figure out such things on your own. Frankly, the main character is the main killer of the experience in such a character-centric story--if he hasn't a flaw to overcome (well, perhaps his downfall is the lack of humility), then why should I be invested in him? And the problem with starting at the end of the story is that none of the great accomplishments established feel deserved. We haven't struggled with the character(s), and even when struggles begin, the main character is hanging over your head, saying, ""Hey, I'm a perfect! Look at me be perfect!"" 
 Still going off of that somewhat old interview (8 years ago, yikes), Rothfuss mentions having revised the novel endlessly, but the product does not shine like the river stone he envisioned. There is nothing noteworthy or pleasantly surprising about the writing style, but simple styles that don't go deep into language are successful, and work rather well depending on how the collective word choice is handled. But quite clearly from my opener, Patrick R. is not the beneficiary of a simple style--rather, his blunt and clumsy use of English serves only to harm this expansive novel. A handful of lines were actually somewhat nice, I will say. But that's just like one polished river stone buried underneath its family of mud and roughness--it cannot cause the others to shine just by being sparkly, and may even be fooling itself with assumed radiance. ""Written with a poet's hand,"" says the book's description. ""Define 'poet',"" says I. 
 I believe that, like a lot of epic fantasy, this could have done with a sizeable compacting of length. And then, perhaps, I might've enjoyed it somewhat more, at the very least. And, well, here we have arrived at the true Name of the Wind: Passed.

2057,3475268,2,"""Boy, was this a drag for most it! So very little happened! It was such an obvious filler book, it was annoying. What annoyed me even more were the references to the short stories (in anthologies, not the freebies) that pretty much made you feel like you were missing information. It wasn't really vital information, but it was bothersome nonetheless. 
 In White Witch Black Curse Rachel needs to track down a banshee, find Kisten's killer (the search and the mourning was pretty much skipped in last book) and deal with a new friend/posible HEA (hey: if it walks, Rachel will do it). 
 I liked the banshee story line, but the Kisten's killer plot ended very anticlimactic and Rachel got on my nerves again despite seeming to better herself last book. I thought she had finally figured out that her life is what she makes of it, that she has a say in what happens to her. Apparently I was mistaken: she was back to externalizing, making stupid decisions and being really self centered in the process. 
 There were also some bits that lacked reason:  I didn't understand the shunning. And I didn't understand Marshall's reaction to it (""you let me down"") because, really: the shunning wasn't based on anything new that Rachel did. It was an accumulation of past events. Also: it happened before she made out with Marshall, so him bowing out over her not keeping 'a promise'? Did I miss anything?  
 Anyway, all in all, this could have been much better if there was actual meat to the plot. And if the Kisten story line was better developed. And if Pierce didn't exist. 
 I did really like Ford (how I wish Harrison would hook him up with Ivy), Al was fabulous as always and Trent totally shined in the (very) few scenes he was in. I can never get enough of Rachel/Trent banter. Ever.

 Caught Up In You has a lot of great characters from the leads, Brantley and Myles, to every single secondary character (my favorites were Tom and Wyatt, Brantley's dad though not so much). They all contribute well to the story, and even though there's a lot of them I don't think the story would feel the same without them. Myles is wonderful, though doesn't necessarily make a smart decision hiding something from Brantley. The two of them together have great chemistry, even if they do clash from the start. 
 The story itself shows the importance of being up front and truthful when you're in a relationship (or trying to be in one), and is told from both Myles and Brantley's points of view. I always like having both the lead characters' POVs as you get so much more to the story that way. While the story does flow well and seems to move quickly, it did feel a bit drawn out at times...but overall it was a nice, dramatic read showing how Brantley and Myles overcome their own pasts as well as their own self-made stumbling blocks to finally find their way back to each other.

2060,186074,4,"""** spoiler alert ** 
 A great read overall, despite a few stumbling blocks. 
 'The Name of the Wind' has a lot of interesting stories to tell, and fascinating places to describe, but the world is so wide and the story so long that we are only given glimpses of the fascinating while Rothfuss dwells on the ordinary. There are monsters that appear and die too quickly. Rothfuss dwells on homeless life in a city. Murder and moments of magic happen for a few pages, but Rothfuss dwells on university life and school friends and chatting about girls. The interesting bits are here one minute and gone the next, to make room for Kvothe playing a lute in taverns. 
 And I have to tackle the female characters. Because the way Rothfuss wrote women is one of the biggest problems that kept me from loving this book. 
 There are some great female characters introduced! One brings back her husband from the dead by calling his name! (he gets the credit. Seriously, she called his name, the lady with magic Naming powers, and he woke, and HE's the amazing one) It doesn't really matter because she's instantly fridged so his character can progress, and get her amazing Naming power (somehow), and turn evil. Not to mention the hints that SOMETHING bad will happen to Denna for the same reason. It's hard to grow attached to Denna, and Rothfuss' descriptions don't help. He doesn't treat her like a person, but like a thing. A wild thing, a hind, a cruel, confusing force of nature. He rarely describes her like a person. 
 There's another girl in the university, Fela, who Kvothe saves from certain death. Thereafter she buys him things, and opens doors for him half naked, and skips class for him. 
 All I can say is, thank goodness for Devi. I have no problems with Devi. She alone is perfect. 
 Overall, the story is interesting and well-thought out, so I can forgive Rothfuss for his female characters. If I couldn't forgive some bad writing where women are concerned I couldn't read anything. 
 I will be reading the next book. If the action picks up, and he writes women more like people, then I will definitely love it.""",2017-01-04 17:09:56,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

2062,77604,4,"""I'm not a fan of WWI-WWII era fiction, and I picked this book up with trepidation, based on a friend's recommendation. It was a little bit better than I expected. The dialogue stands out as genuine and fun, complete with 1930s New York City jargon. It reminds me of the more modern ""Alex Delaware"" series by Jonathan Kellerman. 
 The 1930s era entails weirdness, such as police procedure that's backwards by today's standards, the joys of male chauvinism, and unselfconscious ethnic slurs. This would normally annoy me enough to stop reading. But the first person narration is so honest and genuine, I took it as a capture of the time period--as if I was reading a well researched historical setting. 
 I didn't enjoy Nero Wolfe so much as his interaction with other characters. He lies with elegance, in a way that reminds me of Agent Pendergast in the series by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. 
 Other readers have compared this series to Sherlock Holmes, with the narrator, Archie, in the role of Watson. This is accurate, but Archie has a completely different personality than Watson, which I found refreshing. He's plucky, energetic, and impertinent. His genius detective boss hardly ever moves, whereas Archie hardly ever sits still. His youth comes across well. One thing I loved: Archie's intelligence is shown through actions, not through any praise or statements or inner monologue. He thinks of himself as the dumb muscle, and Nero Wolfe treats him as an subordinate. Yet he's clearly entrusted with the most intelligent tasks, and he considers problems from all angles, working them out on his own. Despite his 1930s attitude, I do like his character.

 I have some serious mixed feelings about this book. When I first started reading, the writing really bugged me. I honestly didn't think I was going to finish it but I kept going and either I got used to it, or it got better, not sure which. 
 The more I read, the more interested I got and the more I connected with Vic. I think a lot of us have been there, in a relationship, where they are your world, everything is better, and more exciting. Maybe they even encourage you to do things you normally would never do but its fun because they are there to support you. So when the relationship gets taken away, it is really devastating. I think this book really brings all these emotions to life and it's not always fun but in my opinion, it was really the heart of the story. 
 The end is where I really have a hard time...which is difficult to talk about without spoiling anything.

 It might sound odd, given that the Harry Potter books are amongst my favourites in the whole world, and I absolutely love the writing of Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, but I'm actually not the hugest fan of fantasy. But to me, those books don't actually feel like fantasy, whereas this really did. Nothing felt real in this book - the characters, the world, the dialogue. Harry Potter & the Discworld, despite clearly being fantasy, so much of it felt real & relatable. Neil Gaiman's characters - they feel real. 
 My main problem was with the main character, Kvothe. I just didn't like him. He was too perfect, too smug. Too much focus on ""Woe is me, I'm poor ... and if you've never been poor I don't expect you to understand."" ... too much ""Everyone took years to accomplish this ... it took me 4 seconds."". I get it. You're brilliant. And, according to him, not even run of the mill brilliant, but extraordinarily brilliant. It got tiring. Quickly. I also found Denna tiresome & unappealing, despite her very manufactured air of mystery. None of the characters felt like they had any depth at all. I don't feel invested in any of them.

 'Left Drowning' features characters who are flawed, very deeply in some aspects. These people have had terrible things happen to them, and they haven't dealt with their situations in very healthy ways, or even at all. I feel like it's common in New Adult books to read about broken characters finding each other and reluctantly giving in to love and healing each other. Technically this book has that, but it didn't feel like a plot device to me. The emotions in this book definitely feel very real, and to me it was like reading about real people with painful pasts. 
 This book is tough to read at times. There are moments when you will hate one character in particular, and will feel your heart break with the other. There are multiple times your heart might ache, but there was also a big emphasis on the strength of love and of family.

 I'm always so impressed with the way Madeleine L'Engle so beautifully incorporates science fiction with the real world. It's so seamless it makes one wonder if such things could truly happen? I'm a believer. 
 We're back with the Austins who are staying on their small family island with Grandpa, who is sick from leukemia. Vicky is on the cusp of becoming an adult and death seems to be all around. Adam Eddington (from The Arm of the Starfish -- which, btw, is an amazing book) is working down at the beach with his dolphins and invites Vicky to join. There is a special connection between Vicky and the dolphins. Something that can't quite be explained, just felt. It's kind of awesome. 
 As life moves on for the Austins, things keep changing. And that's the way it goes. Time doesn't really stop, so one has to cherish each day and remember the good and the bad and appreciate everything. The change is what makes one value what they have.

2077,1122023,3,"""It was a dark and stormy night. (No, really--very dark and lots of storms.) Five college students gather in the common room of their empty dormitory, students who have little character development but who easily fall into the the sacrificial archetypes of horror fiction, as described by the awesome movie The Cabin in the Woods: Robin (the virgin), Lisa (the whore), Patrick (the athlete), Martin (the scholar) and Cain (the fool--well, sorta, as he's a musician.) Bored, they decide to pass the time by playing with a Ouija board. Of course, bad things start to happen. 
 Yes, this book was a terrible hodge-podge of horror cliches. But there's a reason these are all cliches, which is that they are actually entertaining. Even as the thunder crashes, the lights go out, and the stereotypical characters pull out the cursed ""talking board,"" we might groan a bit inside, but we still want to know what comes next. All in all, The Harrowing is a quick read, and it's not badly written. (Besides, Sokoloff went on to write a much better book, The Unseen, and this is her first novel.) 
 I give a few bonus points for an unexpected twist. The spirit is a creature out of Jewish mysticism.

 In a lot of ways, The Body Electric delivered exactly what I was expecting. The futuristic technologies, like the reverie machines, the digital ID wristcuffs, and the whole freaking AWESOME re-invention of Malta kept me so excited to read more. The book was filled with little Easter eggs; references to Phillip K. Dick and other science fiction authors/stories from the past, as well as references to technologies and things present in Revis's Across the Universe series. It was so much fun to notice these and recognize them for what they were. 
 The plot was a bit predictable, but it was fast-paced and kept me guessing at the same time, so I never got tired of reading it. I really adored the main character, Ella, and her determination to find out the truth and not just take the easy way out of things. It was interesting to watch her journey of self discovery, full of revelations both personal and monumental. 
 One thing I always appreciate about Revis's books -- and any good science fiction novel, I think -- is that she fills them with questions. Questions about what could be, questions about what should be. Questions about humanity and morality and the essence of life and death and nature. Where do we draw the line between life and simulation? Is an android alive? I absolutely ate up these aspects of the book, and was pleased to find so much of it present here, especially toward the end. 
 It's not my favorite Revis book (I think Shades of Earth will long hold that position), but it was still a satisfying read in so many ways.

2082,14069,5,"""I started Throne of Jade prepared to be disappointed; the first in the Temeraire series, His Majesty's Dragon, has been one of my favorite books of this year. I am so glad to say, instead, that Throne of Jade was more of the same stuff I loved in the first: more completely lovable protagonist, more character growth from the same man, and more outstanding dragons. 
 (Warning: spoilers for His Majesty's Dragon ahead.) 
 His Majesty's Dragon was Temeraire's origin story, and Throne of Jade is a fitting maturation for the dragon. At the end of His Majesty's Dragon it is revealed that Temeraire is a type of dragon kept exclusively for the imperial Chinese family. Since the Chinese are a much-coveted ally against Napoleon's army, Lawrence, Temeraire, and the rest of their crew have been required to travel to China and meet with the emperor. Lawrence hopes to then take Temeraire back home, but the English ambassador to China intends to leave the dragon in China as a peace offering. 
 I accidentally listened to this book at the same time I was reading Blood of Dragons, the conclusion of Hobb's most dragon-y series so far, and I found it frustratingly impossible to separate the two in my mind. The dragons in the two books are similar in temperament (90% cat), but Temeraire is a gracious, loyal friend while Hobb's dragons are domineering and haughty. Hobb's writing, which I believe is technically better, is just so damn depressing that it's hard to go read her novel when I know the feel-good lovey-dovey warm-fuzzies relationship between Lawrence and Temeraire is waiting on my phone three taps away. I won't make the mistake of reading these two authors side-by-side again - they both deserve better. 
 I absolutely adore the way Novik writes her main characters. In contrast to Hobb - who I feel writes her characters as realistically as possible, flaws and ugliness and all - Novik seems to choose one character flaw and then gently reveal it, challenge it, and then correct it. In His Majesty's Dragon, Lawrence confronts his sexism throughout the book, making a natural and lifelike maturation. In Throne of Jade, the examined flaw is significantly more interesting and more influential to both Lawrence and Temeraire, and it is beautifully relevant today, ten years after the book's publication.

 This book would have been a whole star higher if it wasn't for one main plot point.

The group has also suppressed technology that would render unwinding obsolete. Connor, Risa, Lev, and Cam struggle to stop unwinding and Proactive Citizenry while bringing the suppressed technology to the surface. 
 UnDivided was a satisfying conclusion to the Unwind dystology. It kept me in a nervous excited state that compelled me to keep reading until I finished it. The overall blind heartlessness of the world surprisingly still shocked me. It's terrifying to fathom that people could care so little about the atrocities going on around them, but it's unfortunately all too similar to the world today. 
 One of my favorite parts of this book and the series as a whole was the thick sense of desperation I felt when reading the book. Clearly it's easy to see why teens would be so desperate when almost the entire world wants them for their body parts. I still can't imagine in a normal setting how a parent could sign their child's life away. I can't even imagine any person being willing to sign a child away that they raised in the case of the storked children. Now for the poor kids who are wards of the state it's not at all difficult to fathom them simply being viewed as unfortunate budget cuts. 
 One part I disliked in UnDivided is it transformed itself into more and more of a dystopia as it took on more tropes like the evil corporation responsible for practically everyone's misery. I enjoyed it more in Unwind when the thought was the world was terrified of teenagers and found a brutally efficient way of dealing with them. That felt more genuine and less like an evil business man, sitting in dim light, at a desk with his fingers steepled, and waiting to laugh maniacally. 
 The other thing that bugged me was Camus Comprix's motives. The character's actions really don't make much sense for the majority of the series and UnDivided isn't really an exception. At this point I almost wish he didn't exist. He didn't really add anything to the story overall outside of showing Proactive Citizenry's lack of ethics, but that had already been firmly established and didn't need further bolstering. 
 UnDivided was a thrilling story of a world I hope never approaches becoming a reality.""",2015-09-26 10:28:26,"UnDivided (Unwind, #4)",young-adult;fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime;romance,Neal Shusterman

Due to the raving reviews of a friend I picked The Name of the Wind again vowing to finish it no matter how bored I felt. There was certainly more boredom, but there were a lot of solid moments with a few really good ones tied in. 
 Much of the story was bereft of action unfortunately, but Patrick Rothfuss did an excellent job showing Kvothe's relationship with his romantic interest Deanna  and his enemy Ambrose . Those relationships helped keep things moving through much of the boredom. 
 All in all the story was largely a coming of age tale told in a flashback. Coming of age tales aren't bad, but adding that to a flashback isn't my favorite thing. The flashback format let's people know that whatever happened to the character in the story that the character survives. If the author provides a good physical description of the character it also lets the reader know if the character was or was not maimed or physically harmed to the point they couldn't recover. When such a large portion of a story is told in flashback it always feels like its stealing from the story.

What made me finally pick it up is a Barnes and Noble blog list about the best 10 fantasy titles of the year. I thought, 'I really need to read some adult fantasy if I'm going to try to publish one.' So, this was the blogger's most favorite book and one of the only ones I'd actually heard of on the list. 
 I admit it took me a few pages to get used to the writing, which is a tiny bit denser than your typical YA book. Once I got used to Rothfuss' style, though, I was hooked. I really like the idea of a frame story like this. I read this book nearly every night for a couple weeks, and I enjoyed almost all of it. It has a very Harry Potter like feel because of the Academy and precocious orphan youngster. But it's also different, too, because you know something will happen to Kvothe to bring him down. It takes on a darker feel because of the frame story. You just know that his story probably won't have a happy ending. 
 I liked most of these characters. Kvothe was close to too perfect but there were some times when he was so arrogant I was like, 'What. . .did he just say/think that??' So he had his flaws, too. His friends are good, supportive friends, and I really hope nothing bad happens to them. I like Denna. At first she seemed kind of one dimensional, but I like how the author treated her and their relationship. She surprised me a lot, which is a good thing. The characters in the frame story are intriguing, too. It's less, 'I like these characters!' and more 'I'm intrigued by these characters.' Especially Bast. Not sure whether to trust him or not. 
 The story was great. Had me wondering what was going to happen. Rooting for Kvothe of course, hoping for the best for him. Towards the end, I felt like it started to drag. And it just kind of ended. No real climax or anything. I know that the frame story probably makes it harder for the author to write the typical ""Rising Action/Climax/Falling Action"" thing, but I'm 100 pages into The Wise Man's Fear, and I'm kind of wondering what the point of all this is. Like how does this stuff at the Academy move the plot along? What really happened to Kvothe? Why is he called the Kingkiller? Who are the Chandrian? 
 BUT I'm writing about The Name of the Wind. Overall, it was a great story. I liked the storytelling, the conflicts, the characters. Kept me on the edge of my seat, for sure!

2096,21522102,2,"""Review originally published at Love Literature Art and Reason book review blog. 
 Basically, Kyra spent all of her time in The Replaced trying to find Tyler, who was rumored to have Returned after she gave him up to save his life. Through her adventures with other Returned, she was able to find out more about why she and the others were different and what it was about them that made them so different. 
 I did not like The Replaced at all and I'm very glad that I was able to borrow it from the library and not spend money on it because I would have been super mad about it. While Kyra was definitely doing everything she could to find Tyler, she was also letting Simon play this whole game where he was so obviously trying to be important to her and slide his way into her good graces. It was awful. And she just kept letting him. I was totally on board with the quick romance between Tyler and Kyra and I was committed to that, but the story just lost me with Tyler being ripped out of it and Kyra spending time distracted. I don't have time for love triangles or other teenage nonsense. Give me insta-love and I'll deal if that couple can hack it and just be the thing I'm rooting for, but I can't get on board with a bunch of other awful YA tropes and plot devices thrown in. No. 
 The Replaced was like The Maze Runner/The Scorch Trials with a bunch of betrayals and teenage camps and other eye roll inducing scenarios that just totally lost me. The first book wasn't so much of an action packed story and was more focused on Kyra's emotions and her fitting into a life that moved on without her and exploring her feelings for Tyler and I loved all of that, while the sequel was just more over the top alien abduction research plots that were always a tad far fetched, but at least that wasn't the main focus of book one. I just couldn't do it. I finished, but it was grueling and not satisfying. And to top it off, the eventual return of Tyler was even MORE frustrating and now I'm just mad I ever decided to read book two.

2097,17325147,4,"""Left Drowning was a wonderful book. I saw a handful of negative reviews just after I requested the book, so I was really hesitant to read it. Now that I've finished, I wish I could remember what on earth people didn't like about the book. It is classified as a New Adult Contemporary, but it was a lot different from the New Adult romances I've been reading lately. It was a heart warming story about love, fate, friendship, and getting through tough issues, but it also wasn't afraid to be steamy when the moment called for it. 
 I feel as if lately the New Adult genre has been leaning heavily to the steamy romance and insta-lust kind of direction, the actual storytelling has taken a backseat to the romance, or most of the storytelling is about the romance. Left Drowning had the kind of character growth that a YA contemporary would have, but with added grit and steam, instead of doing away with a lot of the character building in order to make room for the steam, if that makes sense. 
 Blythe was difficult to like at first, but her personal growth skyrocketed due to her making connections with new people. I loved how the personalities of the Shepherd family helped get her out of her own shell and I loved how her growth wasn't just due to her meeting a hot guy. It was due to her meeting his family and forming friendships at the same time. And each of the Shepherd family members had their own distinct personalities, which I enjoyed. No one was a placeholder or a cookie cutter character. I loved her friendship with Chris and the way their relationship blossomed and had it's rocky moments. I never knew what would happen next with them. The two of them together was like a first aid kit.. they healed each other, but it also kind of hurt and didn't feel all that great, even if it helped tremendously overall, like pouring peroxide over a wound. 
 I liked the slowness of Left Drowning and the length. I felt like I got to really know the characters and see them grow both with and without each other in different ways. There was a ton of conflict, but none of it felt forced or done for the sake of drama. The characters had issues that made them a little broken, but the idea of having issues wasn't overdone or over emphasized like many novels I've read. I believed their story, so every bend in the road took me by surprise. I needed a book that gave me something more than a direct route from boy meets girl to steamy connection happens to conflict to resolution. This book had the same map, it just didn't take such a direct and predictable route. 
 The thing I really appreciated about Left Drowning was the way it tackled fate and belief. Blythe and Chris were both absolutely nonreligious. I loved that aspect because I don't often see characters in contemporary romance who don't believe in a God and have that not be a plot point where they'll eventually believe. If a contemporary involves religion, it is typically because one or more of the characters are religious. I am not religious myself, so I really enjoyed seeing two characters who weren't, either, and that wasn't a problem. I was nervous, however, because I wasn't sure if it would later end up being a plot device where they would realize the error of their ways. It isn't that I don't enjoy reading that, but for some reason, I just wanted it to be okay for them to not believe. 
 The story dealt with the idea of fate and I loved that Chris and Blythe were connected, were drawn to each other, and how there was a reason for that. I also loved that the story didn't end with their fate or connection that was due to a higher power, but it wasn't necessarily NOT due to one, either. The story left that decision or option open to a degree. Again, I just loved this for personal reasons, because I felt connected and fated to be with my husband, but neither of us are religious and that's okay. I have never read a romance that dealt with fate, mentioned religion, and yet let the idea of fate remain open and not tied to religion. They either don't mention religion or they tie the two ideas together. I just loved the message that it's okay to believe in God, not believe in God, or believe in other things like fate. 
 A lot of negative reviews have been mentioning the graphicness of the sex scenes and the frequency of them. I'm not really sure if I've just been reading too many New Adult books or if those reviewers haven't been reading enough. Left Drowning had a ton of sex scenes, but I didn't feel bombarded by them and the most important part to me was that the book wasn't just a giant excuse to have sex scenes, which is sort of what's been happening with New Adult books. The fact that there is even a plot with well fleshed out characters in the midst of all the sex is a relief to me, so I don't understand why negative reviews have called this book out in particular. 
 In fact, many of the negative reviews I'm seeing are bringing up all sorts of things like Blythe having issues, Chris not wanting a relationship, the way they sort of hook up and try not to add strings, the insta-love, etc. The only thing I can say is that these issues are no different from any other New Adult title I've read and Left Drowning would certainly not be THE book I'd pick to discuss issues in the category. I am gathering that these reviewers just don't read New Adult romances typically, because I definitely wouldn't call out Left Drowning as a bad example at all. 
 I think Left Drowning is a good example of New Adult Contemporary Romance and has a lot less of the kind of unhealthy things we have been seeing in the genre (but some of us are still loving anyway), like bad boys and dependent heroines. 
 Bottom Line: Left Drowning is a great New Adult Contemporary Romance with likeable characters, a well written and executed plot, and a romance I can root for. I definitely recommend it, but not to anyone who doesn't enjoy romance, sex scenes, or swearing.

2098,12985143,5,"""Hemlock was such fun and engaging book. A world where werewolves exist and have no rights? They were sent to camps to protect the population. I loved the politics. In a lot of ways, it reminded me of a werewolf version of The Coldest Girl in Coldtown by Holly Black, which was great: a little romance, an awesome heroine, and a scary and thrilling plot! 
 I liked Mac a lot and I cared about the people in her life. Her best friend, Amy, died as a result of a werewolf attack. Everyone had secrets and the town was getting pretty crazy after the attack. Mac was curious, but she discovered maybe she didn't know what was going on in her best friend's life at all. There were secrets, betrayal, love, and drama with all of the characters. 
 The town turned into kind of a police state with werewolf trackers and the politics of werewolf rights intrigued me. I loved the parallels with regular society. Hemlock was a town where nothing and nowhere was safe, but the narration and some of the characters made it fun to read as opposed to just action packed and scary. It was funny and sweet when it needed to be and Mac was pretty spunky, tough, and a little naive. I liked her so much. 
 Books like Hemlock are some of my favorites. I like when fantasy and paranormal plots use the element of danger and ignore the secrecy. There are so many plots where the mythical creatures are secret, enchanting, and the characters involved are enamored by them. I enjoy that, but I love the other side, where the existence of the creatures is known and they ARE dangerous. It leaves so many doors open for real life parallels, such as the werewolf rights politics of Hemlock. 
 And what is a YA paranormal without a decent love story? Sure, it's kind of a triangle, but it's actually one of those good ones. And it's kind of awesome that as soon as the triangle formed, the main character made fun of herself and compared her experience to a teen angst drama that would probably air on the CW, which made me laugh out loud. I love it when a book can do that and be fun while also being romantic or dramatic or scary. It's so refreshing. 
 I really enjoyed Hemlock. So much that I bought Thornhill without a second thought immediately after finishing. Not because it's one of THOSE books where you're left totally hanging and you realize how much you actually hate series, but because I really wanted to know what happens next because I love the characters and their adventure. So, of course, I definitely recommend the book.

2099,186074,5,"""I really enjoyed it. It didn't follow the typical fantasy guidelines. Instead of being focused on the quest and the main adventure, like most fantasies, it was focused on a character. We begin the story knowing the man Kovthe is an innkeeper. The first question I had (and still don't have an answer to) is why is Kovthe disguised as an innkeeper in a tiny village? What on earth would possess a hero of his time to tend a bar? 
 I enjoy character based literature, so this book captivated me. 
 I did not purchase the rest of the series since I didn't know if I'd like this one, but now I wish I had because the story ended so soon. If I paid more attention, I would have notice this was entitled Day One of the Kingkiller Chronicles. This means it was Day One of Kovthe telling his story. 
 Another thing I really enjoyed was the prologue and epilogue. I don't want to give too much away, but it was perfect. I recommend this book, even to those who aren't huge fans of fantasy.

 The writing is atrocious; the characters are over-the-top god-beings who have such unbelievable stories that make me really just not care.

Overuse of be verbs, ridiculous description, and repeating information over and over and over and over again killed any desire I have to finish this novel.

 ""If I seem to wander, if I seem to stray, remember that true stories seldom take the straightest way."" -The Name of the Wind 
 And maybe the straightest way isn't the right one. The straightest way may not have connected me as it did. I may not of cried or laughed as much, both of which I did often. 
 I can't describe this book without saying it was full. Full and heavy and bitter-sweet. It took me by surprise how little wonderful things could feel like the equivalent of parting an ocean. Patrick Rothfuss set the story just right, the horrid childhood of Kvothe nearly breaking me before showing me the light at the end of the tunnel. What was better? It was Kvothe that made that light, his choice to change his luck and take a chance. I've never met a more driven, and kind character than Kvothe but he is more than a character. His life is so full and as a reader you experience so much of it that he can only be considered as real. 
 The best part about this book: the world building is phenomenal. I have no doubt that this world was thought about so continuously that it became real to Rothfuss because you can not write such a world without knowing every part of it. I felt like nothing was missing. The magical aspects weren't far fetched, they were described and executed in such a way that I found them very believable. 
 All in all, I have no complaints. I would change nothing.

 3.5/5 
 Geek Love is a strange story, and it's definitely not for everyone. If the description sounds odd, believe me when I say it gets quite weird. There are a lot of disturbing things that happen within this novel such as cults, taking drugs while pregnant to get ""special"" children, sketchy doctors, and mutilation. This is a unique story with quite a few subplots, and it's easy to see that a lot of time and research went into creating this novel, which is admirable. The characters are not exactly likeable and they have plenty of flaws, but they're distinct and add their own dimension to the story. They're intriguing and make you want to find out what happens to the family. I didn't particularly like the parts of the story where there was a focus on Oly when she's older. These moments seemed to drag the story down and make it a little boring. I wanted the story to stay with the Binewskis when Oly is younger because I feel like the book would have had more of an impact. If the book ended with Chick's final act, it could have been more powerful with a more drawn out scene. I ended up having to read that section twice to confirm what actually happened and that moment could have been more epic if that were the official ending. This book is worth reading but be warned that this novel takes disturbing to a new level.

2112,29780253,5,"""Before I start my review, I want to take a minute to praise Trevor Noah's stand up shows because they're one of the few that don't rely on being ignorant. His shows are one of the enlighten ones focusing on race, white-privilege, police brutality, hate speech, prejudice, and so much more. 
 I'd highly recommend watching a few before reading this riveting memoir. 
 In Born a Crime, Trevor Noah takes us on a journey from his childhood being born a crime in apartheid South Africa. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. This memoir is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man's relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother: his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. 
 Side note: Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah - his mother - was a powerhouse, a strong woman in every sense. She's a warrior and I only wish I could be a half of the person she is. Also, I love the advice she gave her son--I even wrote a few pieces down to remember: 
 ""Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He's attracted to independent women. ""He's like an exotic bird collector,"" she said. ""He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage."" 
 This passage had pretty much changed the way I think, the way I precept the world. 
 ""She'd tell me not to worry. She always came back to the phrase she lived by: ""If God is with me, who can be against me?"" She was never scared. Even when she should have been."" 
 The piece stuck with me. 
 Truly though, this memoir was enlighten, brimming with emotion, and I love it when children pay tribute to their hard-working mothers. 
 ""There was no stepfather in the picture yet, no baby brother crying in the night. It was me and her, alone. There was this sense of the two of us embarking on a grand adventure. She'd say things to me like, ""It's you and me against the world."" I understood even from an early age that we weren't just mother and son. We were a team."" 
 My mind and heart were fully transported while reading everything Trevor went through to get to where he is today and everyone that took part of that journey. 
 And even though some of the stories kind of broke my heart, Trevor Noah always managed to bring in his gold humor to ease the tension. There are a couple of chapters that have taken a hold of my soul and won't let go because either they were extremely hilarious (TREVOR, PRAY & LOOPHOLES) or entirely heart-shattering (MY MOTHER'S LIFE)... or both. 
 Slowly and surely, I came to admire Trevor Noah's character and honesty even more than I did before. And I'm pretty sure that I'll end up watching and rewatching his stand-up shows so that I can stop tearing up at the mention of his name.

 These robots are there to help in any way to make life easier for humans. 
 We read only from Alex's perspective, which I found to be really disappointing. He felt like a very bland character and I didn't like that his facial expressions almost never changed. 
 But when he did feel something (mostly sadness), he started to remind me of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character in (500) Days of Summer. Meaning that he's very selfish and not a romantic role model. Maybe that was the goal?

2118,186074,4,"""The Kingkiller Chronicle represents exciting news for fantasy lovers, with weaknesses due only to its first-installment status in the (already written) trilogy. The complexity just hasn't been achieved, yet. Since Rothfuss has already long since completed the three books, there is an assurance to readers that the series shan't drag on in unseemly fashion for decades. 
 Rothfuss's strength is in strong characters, even though they are shallow (as yet) by the ordinary standards of epic fantasy. We know a wealth about our narrator, Kvothe, from a musical acting family, his story laden with heavy doses of heartache and tragedy. He is a boy who turns out to be a meta-savant. Thin. Good at everything. Attractive, athletic, curious. Faults - perhaps he antagonizes his powerful antagonists a bit too thoroughly. All other personages in The Name of the Wind are a tad two-dimensional. His love, Denna, is strikingly beautiful and has a light, haunting, ""cruel"" air about her. But little in her description or dialogue sets her apart from Fela, the beauty who works at the library, except that they are, technically, two different people. Kvothe's friends at the university are the usual ribbing, chortling boys who enjoy a good ale and a good woman, yet largely absent are any specifics about their families, backgrounds, places of birth, motivations, etc. I often lost track of which one was which or from where they might hail. 
 Granted, the world is not fully developed in this first volume. The University and the city of Imre abut, for example. Yet aside from a typical ""other side of the tracks"" mentality, the two have little in the way of appreciable differences. The large city of Tarbean has no personality. We know there is a ghetto and therein the urchins have it rough, as urchins do. Character names too are seemingly haphazard. Kvothe, I actually find fresh. Lanre? Siletos? Skarpi? Abenthy? Geography and cultural descent seem to play no part in the timbre of the names - they appear to be a random arrangement of sounds. People from the rural villages and pulsating cities have few apparent differences, especially in the melting pot of the University, and incursions by new characters from faraway lands involve no culture shock whatsoever. All of this detracts from a feeling of size and scope. It feels as if everyone is from Jersey, just a few bus stops apart. 
 To its credit, NOTW has a robust and interesting magic system. To be fresh in this area is an achievement indeed. It is not overused and while abstract does remain consistent throughout (i.e. there is no cheating). And Kvothe's story does crescendo to an intriguing climax foreshadowing of a massive story to come. The entire novel is actually a biographical tale recounted by Kvothe to Devan Lochees, The Chronicler, at an inn, with the past and present seemingly on a collision course. To be furthered at the next installment, which - to be taken as a recommendation - I will be reading.""",2011-02-06 21:50:25,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

2120,4954833,3,"""Brooklyn is the story of a young girl, Eilis (pronounced ""Eye-lish""), who lives in a small Irish town in the early 1950s and immigrates to America to improve her condition. The story switches between Enniscorthy and Brooklyn while Eilis tries to figure out where she really belongs. 
 It's a quick, pleasant read; the descriptions are beautifully written, and the contrasts and parallels between the two settings are vivid and powerful. The author brings up the subjects of social prejudice and discrimination in a subtle, realistic way, through Eilis' naive eyes and through the almost satirical portraits of obtuse women like Miss Kelly and Mrs Kehoe, who make you cringe almost every time they speak. 
 The author explores a female mind in a very convincing way, with a rather refined sensibility - sometimes I wondered if a man really wrote this book, especially in the description of Eilis' first time. 
 That said, I couldn't quite sympathize with the protagonist: Eilis is completely passive, she lets other people determine her fate and she just watches her life as it passes her by. Although the story is told by her point of view, I can never understand what she really wants: her feelings and desires change according to the environment and the people she is with, and she just doesn't seem able to make up her mind about anything. Her introvert, obedient nature is due to many factors: her Catholic upbringing, the conservative environment she was raised in, gender expectations - she is under a lot of pressures simultaneously. 
 The problem is, she remains static throughout the novel, and that is why the ending was really disappointing to me: the lack of character development just left a bitter taste in my mouth. """,2015-07-10 05:55:17,Brooklyn,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance,Colm Toibin

2122,17345218,4,"""I re-read Bridget Jones's Diary this year and was startled to see how much I still related to her. (In quite a few unappealing ways, I might add.) 
 I'm surprised to see how much I relate to fifty-one-year-old Bridge, too, although perhaps that is because she hasn't changed as much in fourteen years as I have in a month. But, as the book asks, does anyone ever truly change? 
 After the death of her husband, Bridget raises her two kids, tries to date again, lose weight (with Zumba!), and regain her inner poise and Zen thought. She's still witty and laugh-out-loud funny and, yes, sometimes completely hopeless, but there's a nice emotional undercurrent of sadness and loss here that gives the book a nice resonance. 
 This book mirrors the first in many ways. Bridget learns to like someone she formerly despised. The first man she dates isn't exactly the right for her. And she ends up with someone in the end who you totally see coming a mile away (although this one didn't actually make me like him). 
 I definitely plan on adding this into the rotation of my yearly Bridget Jones re-read, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it holds up.""",2014-01-05 18:44:56,"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy (Bridget Jones, #3)",fiction;romance,Helen Fielding
2123,9471965,3,"""A fast-paced globetrotting adventure, Heist Society is good page-turning fun. It's a bit like an Ocean's Eleven (or seven, in this case) for teens. 
 Katarina Bishop is your typical young-adult heroine, i.e. she's atypically smart, observant, witty, and a babe who doesn't yet think she is attractive. She's surrounded by a motley crew of other young thieves--lifelong friend Hale, her busty cousin Gabrielle, a pair of brothers, a computer expert, and a hot young newcomer whom she might have reason not to trust. 
 The story itself is fairly straightforward. Tidy prose makes the pages flip by. There's some good humor in here too. While the plot may be fairly simple, the heist isn't, and there are some neat twists and tricks along the way. 
 As an adult reader, I knew everything would turn out okay in the end. And it does, wrapped up in a tidy package. The danger the kids face along the way is never quite dangerous. Everything feels safe, slick and polished. It's a fun ride while it lasts, though.

2124,147842,4,"""I feel like I need to point out up front that this is actually a positive review of this book and series. It's just that there are some relatively minor things that bug me. 
 So, my local public library finally picked up the paperback of this third-of-four volumes and put it on the ""NEW"" shelf. Well, at least that means I found it. 
 I've been patiently following this series since Green Rider was published way back in (checks author's website) 1998. Patience has been required, because the sequel First Rider's Call did not appear until 2003, this third volume came out (in hardcover) in 2007, and the fourth volume, Blackveil, was issued in hardcover and ebook formats in February of 2011. 
 Am I going to say it's been worth the wait for this third volume? Yes. Am I in raptures over the series? Not quite. It's good, solid high fantasy, with good, solid writing (language, characterization, plotting, the works). There are good, creative ideas in it, and some derivative ones. I'm not, I have to admit, completely convinced that the basic story really needed four volumes to tell, but that's more in the nature of a quibble (and one that I've felt more strongly about with regard to some other series). 
 About the story: The country of Sacoridia has spent centuries recovering from a devastating war. In that time, the use of magic has been abandoned by everyone except the elite corps of ""Green Riders,"" the monarch's messenger service (their uniforms are green), and even they don't ""use"" magic as such; they think they have ""talents"" granted by the magical brooches they wear. Oh, and they're ""called"" by magic. 
 Sound vaguely familiar yet? They also have unusually intelligent horses; the secret of these is finally revealed in High King's Tomb, and I have to admit it wasn't anything I was expecting. That's the way the whole series has been for me: various vaguely familiar elements that usually turn out to be new models. I know it's asking a lot to suggest that any high fantasy be composed of all new ideas, but there's enough of this in the series that it keeps me from enjoying it without reservation. 
 At any rate, despite its rejection of magic in a world where it actually does work, Sacoridia has not been ravaged by foreign magic-users ... because the remnants of the Arcosian invaders who might be using it were locked in the Blackveil Forest behind a physical/magical wall (called the D'Yer Wall). Garth Nix's Sabriel, whose Old Kingdom is hemmed in by a magical wall, was published in 1995. These two walls are in no way identical, except for being walls that keep evil at bay. (I'm not clear, in either case, on why the evil doesn't just go around, but oceans may have something to do with it.) 
 So. Our main protagonist is Karigan, a merchant's daughter who is drafted into the Green Riders. By Volume 3, she's settled into the life (which is not at all what she had in mind), helped to prevent the overthrow of the rightful monarch by his brother (and fallen in love with him), and managed to keep a breach in the D'Yer Wall from leading to the total destruction of Sacoridia. Alton Deyer, descendant of the D'Yers who have forgotten their ancient magical building skills, is trying to figure out how to repair the breach and, as the book goes on, how to keep the wall from failing entirely. Also, the book tracks the activities of the survivors of Sacoridia's fifth column, descendants of the Arcosians who call themselves Second Empire and expect to take over Sacoridia any day now. Their leader has magic - and she, by the way, seems to be a completely original (and chilling) character. 
 So, seriously, the historical background mostly makes sense, especially with the various reveals that finally turn up in this volume. The plot actually zooms right along, making these elements I'm complaining about recede into the background most of the time (though the way horsemaster Damian Frost and his wife Lady reminded me of Tom Bombadil and Goldberry was a bit painful). Did I mention the Eletians? Tolkienish elves, with variations. They and some of the other characters can traverse another dimension, which looks like an endless plain, which I think I recall from the early volumes of the Wheel of Time series (I only read the first two or three). 
 I think, as with the Wheel of Time series, that it's not the presence of these familiar elements that bugs me; it's the number of them (there are a few others that I haven't mentioned). I bet if the series were shorter, there would be fewer and I'd notice them less. And I do have to say, the burial customs of the Sacoridian kings were a most unexpected and interesting touch. I'm not sure they make sense in the larger cultural context, but they're definitely different - and the tombs are the setting of the book's climax, which features a revelation that I was definitely not expecting. 
 So, the story is sweeping, political, magical, sometimes military, and in this volume it's clear that at least one god is getting involved. There are vanishingly few instances of characters being stupid for the sake of the plot; in a couple of cases there are characters being more intelligent than I expected, which is a very nice thing. There is only one thing that actually bugs me enough to nearly make me put the books down: Karigan's main character quirk seems to be getting into embarrassing - even humiliating - minor scrapes. In this volume, for example, she's talked into going out with a young merchant's son and winds up trying to fight in a fancy, restricting dress (humiliating) and later gets knocked off her horse by a porch roof (don't ask). I can easily see Karigan being played by Anne Hathaway in the movie. But it undercuts her overall competence and, frankly, I personally hate embarrassment and hate seeing it repeatedly in a book (or a movie, for that matter). 
 Still. The books are enjoyable reads, despite these things that bug me, and I hope my library gets the fourth volume soon, so I can read it.""",2011-05-30 08:56:25,"The High King's Tomb (Green Rider, #3)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Kristen Britain

Reading about the book afterwards, it seems much of the story was known, so I'm not sure what this added other than Hadley's internal thoughts. I thought Ernest was the more fascinating character. The fact that he was later found to have suffered from hemochromatosis, which caused suicidal depression throughout his family history, plus the PTSD he likely suffered in the war and covering wars, made him a very compelling character. Then add on the usual insecurities of being a writer, and you have to wonder that he was able to do anything at all with his life. He's the one whose head I wanted to get into (I should read his memoir). The problem of fictionalizing a true story is that you are left with the arc you are given.

 Blythe seems nuts and a wreck on the surface, but in reality her life was very good up until all of a sudden it wasn't. Chris seems totally together, but in reality he's trying to avoid digging too deep; he's had to fight for every good thing he has. When the two of them meet and Blythe becomes friends with Chris and his family, Blythe starts learning to deal with her past. With the foundation of a good childhood behind her, once she confronts the terrible thing that happened to her family, she's able to imagine a better life for herself and move forward. But the opposite happens to Chris. When he realizes he's going to have to come to terms with his own past, he retreats instead, putting a major obstacle between him and Blythe. The question becomes, is there a second chance for these two? Can Chris allow Blythe to support him as he deals with his problems, as he did for her? Or is he going to stay scared and make both of them lose out on the best thing that's ever happened to them? 
 I loved all these characters, and could identify with everybody. I love Blythe and Chris as a couple. The emotional bones of my own past are closer to Chris's, and while I (along with everybody else) don't like the big decision he makes about two-thirds of the way through the book, I can understand his motivation for it. My only real gripe about this book is that the ""big reveal"" didn't do much for me. I didn't feel it materially altered my understanding of the characters or what their relationship was or should be. It seemed to be more significant to them than to me. Also it is not really a big part of the plot as a whole anyway imo. 
 Also, the sex scenes were really hot. 
 This book, like most, isn't for everyone (I think my husband is still wading through it, and he's annoyed by most of the characters).

 A very abrupt ending that I didn't like.  The dome can't be saved. collapses in on itself and no the world must go on  I felt like nothing was tied up or explored. So we can guess that  Bradwell, Partridge and his wife are all dead or will probably be soon, Pressia and El Capitan will start to live in a new world and Lida will probably go live with the mothers.  
 But nothing of the after was explored. Nothing of how the pures and Wretches will live together, or if Arvin does anything with the experiments on the babies, How the mothers and the pures live together (or don't).... 
 Some authors are guilty or stringing out their ending beyond what is needed, but these books are the opposite. They just end. not real moral to the stories or showing anything beyond the destruction of the dome. No further worl building or anything. 
 I didn't like that how life in other countries weren't really explored even though  they crossed an ocean  And that things that were constant through out the book- like Pressias search for her father never amounted to anything. 
 The author had unique ideas and an interesting world, but in the end didn't do anything with them. A disappointing end to a series that had good potential.  """,2016-04-24 14:55:51,"Burn (Pure, #3)",young-adult;fiction;fantasy;paranormal;romance,Julianna Baggott

 Not a lot of action happened and things were drawn out at times but that is to be expected in the 2nd of (currently) 8 books. 
 That being said this book really made me stop and think. It was really about how humans treat creatures that they feel are beneath them. Temeraire is a very intellectual creature who can learn, communicate in 3 languages and loves to read... But he is treated like a prize horse. Traded for alliances and then when he doesn't end up with who is original 'owners' wanted they insist on having him back and separated from his bonded human companion. 
 No one cares what Temeraire wants other than his bonded companion. Governments, politicians and everyone else want to use him as a tool because he is a rare breed of dragon and they don;t care that he doesn't want to go to another country, be torn from his companion more treated like a porcelain doll. He wants to protect his homeland and fight beside his friends. But noooo.... Humans know whats best. ALWAYS. 
 This frustrates me in real life, the meddling of humans where we are not needed. Animals have lived thousands of years without our help. stop hunting them without regard to their populations, leave them alone and stop destroying their habitat and they will recover. If they don't no amount of human intervention will help in the wild. 
 I like that this book reflects some very serious modern day issues but in a way that isn't preachy or shoving it in peoples faces. Its just we get the point of view from an intellectual creature who can speak english and it transfers to the situations that humans put wild animals in today.

What is unclear is whether she was the unwilling victim of James McDermott or the temptress that manipulated him and forced him into action with sexual promises. 
 Atwood takes the story and the mysteries around it which may never be solved and turns it into an inquest. Dr Jordan is an up and coming doctor in the field of insanity. Grace Marks claims that she has gaps in her memory from when the murders were committed. He is trying to figure out if that is true, and how the amnesia came to be, as well as what really happened that day. He has been hired by a group of people who believe that Grace was wrongly convicted and who wish to overturn her conviction. 
 I found the novel a little slow at first, but I really started getting into things by the middle. It goes through Grace's entire history, from her poverty stricken childhood to her time in various households as a servant. Along the way, she meets Mary Whitney, a free spirit who becomes her best friend. Grace and Mary are inseparable until tragedy strikes. Eventually Grace ends up in Kinnear's house where things are not as they seem, and everyone is hiding something.

 Rothfuss's writing manages to be lyrical and flowery while still being blunt and to the point. He doesn't add descriptions to make the prose seem beautiful, he just writes the plot beautifully. It drew me into the story from the first page, making reading interesting even before the action began. It got even better as I read on, as Kvothe's character is very interesting. Is he a bit too heroic and competent? Yeah, but it's fantasy. I don't want to read about someone pathetic. And Kvothe definitely has flaws.

Still, it wasn't overwhelming, and I have to give credit where credit is due: I hate long books, but I never once wished this was 100 pages shorter.

2163,14064,4,"""This is a pretty cheesy concept. I knew that going in. Once I got past it, I was able to fully enjoy this book. 
 The first thirty or forty pages of this were pretty rough for me. Firstly, the main character is a terrible person. He spends a lot of time talking about wanting to rape vampires. I get it. He hasn't had sex in a really, really long time. But it wasn't like, ""I had a fleeting image of sleeping with a vampire, but then I realized they aren't capable of consent."" More like, ""I would so do her. It seems kinda gross to screw a vampire though..."" However,  the author didn't mean for us to like this man. By developing my hatred for him, Matheson makes the ending that much more effective.  So it was necessary character development. 
 Also, this was before Robert had figured out anything about the way vampires function. You'd think he'd be a little more bored/curious, but apparently not. The book begins as he is just starting his research. Again, this was necessary. We had to see how Robert lived. Establish the setting and all that. At the same time, when a book is 160 pages long, 50 pages before any action is way too long. 
 Vampirism... doesn't make any sense. I Am Legend comes to closest I've seen to explaining it in a scientific way. Robert's research is logical and he doesn't miss any obvious conclusions. The research also isn't unrealistically straightforward. I was interested in his journey to the truth. My interest was further peaked by Robert's flashbacks to the apocalypse itself. They gave me a deeper understanding of the world in a much more interesting way than the boring beginning. It also helped to (somewhat) explain Robert's terribleness. 
 I loved the ending.  The way Robert, although ""normal"" is alien. Normalcy changes. Robert kept his old believes, that vampires were monsters, but when literally everyone is a vampire, that's kind of a selfish way to think. That hadn't occurred to me at the beginning of the book, but it makes perfect sense. It's a thought-provoking twist on other vampire novels.  
 This will never be a five star book because vampires are ridiculous and  the ending requires us to hate the main character.  Still, there's nothing I would really change.

2165,29780253,4,"""My first real introduction to (or really awareness of) Trevor Noah occurred when he took over The Daily Show from its creator, Jon Stewart. Then I saw him perform live. Following which, a few weeks ago, I watched a documentary on his first solo stand-up show Daywalker in South Africa ... the documentary is called You Laugh, But It's True. I did not walk into this biography without any ideas about his life. 
 But this work illuminates more about his personal experiences as a half-black half-white kid growing up in South Africa during and after apartheid. It really doesn't detail the rise of his career. It focuses more on his relationship with his fearless mother, his relationship with the concept of race ("" ...and race is a social construct, so...""), and a large part is actually dedicated to South Africa's cultural, racial, and socialized gender relationships. 
 I think though that Noah's mother, Nombuyiselo, ""she who gives"" is actually the true subject of his book. His mother chose to bring him into the world, actively. She wanted a child. And as a result, his life was obviously shaped by this relationship between mother and son. She is definitely where he gets his sense of humor. After listening to Trevor tell his mother's story, about her life thus far, I deeply respect her. Even to the point where reconsidering religion and its power in people's lives became part and parcel of my thought processes throughout the book. At first, Noah talks about the three different churches his mother attended every Sunday ... and I was like, ""Jesus, I remember that"" in the sense that church as a kid for me was actually 3 times as long as mass as other people's churches (uggghh, what a waste of time). And his continually arguments with his mother about why Jesus would rather he rest and take medicine when he was sick on a Sunday than be healed at church were hilarious. His mother's belief and optimism is nothing short of impressive and something to be admired. I, in the meantime, will continue to be a heathen. But she has made me rethink my stance (which is always a interesting and good thing, in my own belief). 
 If you want to read this book, I would actually suggest that you listen to the audiobook.

 I really enjoyed the witty banter between Nero Wolfe and his assistant, Archie Goodwin. The plot was interesting, but wandered a bit. Worthy of mention are the humor sprinkled in and the 1930's solid sense of place, the way the 1930's felt contemporary and current -- people think the same, just different forms of technology and tools. 
 --I wanted more explanation of how Nero Wolfe arrived at his detailed conclusions off of such slim clues. 
 --I didn't like the rough treatment of a female reluctant witness to get her to talk. 
 --Wolfe's cavalier attitude regarding an event at the end: not only did Wolfe, in his genius, anticipated another murder, but part of the plot was the urgency to prevent it. When this did not happen, I felt disappointed. Wolfe's casual attitude toward the event that he should have had the genius to prevent came across as unjustified vigilantism and irresponsible. The first murder was a decades ago crime of passion that didn't seem to justify the attitude.  
 --Wolfe's actions seemed primarily money-driven and his sense of justice or greater good of any kind seemed really stunted by comparison.

2172,20768868,2,"""This is my first Scarpetta novel and my first novel by Cornwall. 
 I give it a strong 2 rating: It started out 4, then dropped to a 3 during most of it - which I was OK with, and then 1 during the last 10-20 pages or so. I weight the endings really heavily. A 3 can be extremely satisfying to read with a great ending. 
 What I liked: 
 The narrative shows that of a highly skilled and talented author from the beginning, giving me high hopes. The first half of the book moved along well except for the stuck-in-traffic portion. 
 Some of the ammunition and ballistics stuff went over my head, but was overall still interesting. The descriptions of the crime scenes and how the evidence was described and used to piece together the puzzle was fascinating. 
 I really enjoyed the interview scene of Leo when he was in custody. 
 Neutral: 
 I like Italian food. The descriptions of it could have been more mouth-watering, otherwise they were just extra words on the page. 
 There were other descriptive passages that did not add to the story and I started skimming over them. 
 What bugged me: 
 0 Chemistry between protagonist (Kay Scarpetta) and her husband (Benton) 
 Apparent Relationship Conflict through vague or non-communication. The non-communication by her husband bothered Kay throughout the novel, but I didn't feel her pain because of the zero chemistry between and her husband -- who came across and two-dimensional and dull -- and there were insufficient attempts by her to communicate with him for this to be plausible. I didn't know if I was to feel Kay's upset because of their relationship or if she was anxious for potential information he may have. I wanted something more definite on this. For a brilliant mind, she had trouble defining her thoughts and feelings. There insufficient resolution between them of this at the end. 
 I like a small mention of each main character's appearance in the beginning and something that helps me approximate their age. I think I had Kay Scarpetta and her husband pegged as a lot younger than they probably are in this novel because I was kinda surprised by the silver hair reference when Kay saw her husband at the end. 
 Kay repeatedly refers to an atmosphere of dread or doom, but nothing in the narrative caused me, the reader, to sense this, feel this, relate to this or believe this. 
 Cliched characters (verging on caricatures) - especially the real estate agent and the Bloom character; and also some of those working in Kay's department. In a comedy mystery they would be appropriate. Here, they messed up the underdeveloped mood even further. 
 Random crimes were not connected in a plausible way by the end of the story. I am supposed to believe they were random victims, chosen in advance, just to toy with Kay. Really. 
 Lack of money or resources or constraints of a budget never seems to be a stress or problem to deal with for Kay or any of those close to her or the departments she works with or for the criminal(s). Fast cars, helicopters, boats, re-booked plane flights, extra law enforcement, high tech weapon testing equipment just keep appearing on demand out of nowhere. Really? Has the author never had to face financial issues that those of us in the real world face? 
 Vague motive: The protagonist felt it was a planned vendetta against her and/or her niece personally, but no suspects came to mind. Some random criminal, whom, it turned out, should have been on the protagonists suspect list of people who could be out there. We're supposed to believe that the antagonist wants to personally target Kay to deeply frustrate her and ruin her psychologically, but the novel provided to plausible motive for the antagonist to care about Kay at all or kill the victims and thus go through all the expense and trouble to do so.  
 The wrap-up was rushed, unsatisfying, unbelievable and included a pet peeve of mine: stupidity on the part of the brilliant protagonist, as well as implausible omissions of security on the part of law enforcement. I call this the cop-out ending. We're supposed to believe A) that a boat approaching the vicinity of a crime scene involving a high ranking U.S. official would not be confronted and investigated by law enforcement. The book make it sound like it was exclusively Kay's call as to what to do about the boat. B) more armed personnel would not be guarding the above crime scene and protecting the investigators, and C) a master criminal at large would have the opportunity to circulate in the area of the his/her target and the brilliant target would leave herself and her family vulnerable to this criminal. Uh-huh.  
 Such a big deal was made about the pennies and the copper. The ending did not resolve this to my satisfaction. Like Kay wasn't brilliant enough to figure out that several murders in a couple of days couldn't be related? It is implied the murderer wanted Kay to figure it out but not be able to prove it in court and then have to go on to live with that frustration, but as I mentioned above: what was the murder's motive?  
 I have heard the early Scarpetta books are better. Because this author obviously has competence and sales success, I plan to start at the beginning of the series and try a few of those.""",2015-05-05 10:32:27,"Flesh and Blood (Kay Scarpetta, #22)",mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Patricia Cornwell

 With the third and final book, Champion, released, I thought it was about time I give this series another reread and write up reviews for them. I really love this series and I am so sad for it to end that I am putting off even starting Champion, plus Allegiant has put me off ever reading the last book in a series again! 
 I read Legend for the first time at the start of 2012, as I hunted for more and more dystopian fiction to devour. Luckily, I work in a library and with people who love books as much as me and a guy I work with told me that if I loved dystopian then I just had to read this. He was right. If you are a lover of dystopian fiction like me then I would really recommend it. 
 Legend is fast-paced action from beginning to end, it throws you straight into the action almost from the very beginning. It pulls you straight into the story and doesn't really let you go until the end. It makes this such a quick read and very enjoyable. 
 This book gives us a dual narrative, in one chapter we get June and in the next we have Day. I think they worked well and weren't too similar as far as I was concerned. June is a strong female character but I have to admit to wanting to hit her sometimes, for someone so smart she could be ridiculously stupid. Day is a really great male lead, he's strong, clever and dedicated to his family. 
 I really enjoyed the story, a lot happens in this book even though it feels quite short. It may seem a little predictable at times but this is a really well told story, it's a great addition to the dystopian genre and it immediately became a new favourite series of mine as soon as I read it. 
 The fast-paced action grabs you but it did make it seem lacking in other ways. As it was so fast-paced I didn't feel like I got as much character development of June and Day as I would of liked; I wish their had been more of that. Their romance seemed to develop really, really quickly as well.. Plus it lacked a little on world building, it doesn't explain why things are the way they are or give a clearer picture on what's going on outside of L.A. 
 I'm also confused as to why the back of my book says ""Based on a retelling of Les Miserables."" Now this really threw me off when I picked the book up and read it, because I didn't see it at all. Is it a retelling of Les Mis, or a retelling of a retelling of Les Mis. To me, it seemed like neither and that just confused me a little when I read the book for the first time. 
 4/5 Stars

I will say this book was ON POINT with the emotions. It gripped me from page one and didn't let me go until the very last word. I FELT EVERYTHING. It's safe to say I had about a million heart attacks with the characters. One second I was like ""oh ok this isn't so bad"" and the next second I wanted to throw my kindle. 
 ""I feel relieved because I loved her, but not as much as I loved you."" 
 The love. The hate. The hurt. The betrayal. It's all in this book and Kandi does such a phenomenal job at expressing each emotion. Like I knew halfway into the book that Kandi would be a favorite of mine, and I knew without a doubt I will be reading all of her books. Previously written and whatever's to come. She really is just an amazing writer, and should honestly never stop writing. 
 I know this review has nothing to it besides me saying how amazingly perfect it was (I did say that right?). But seriously if you have read any of my reviews, or follow any of them, please trust me when I say you have to read this book. It Is everything. A Love Letter to Whiskey was one hell of an emotional roller-coaster, and it is a book I will never forget. Ever. 
 Kandi, you are amazing, and I'm so happy that you shared your words with the world. This was seriously one of the best books I've ever read, and it will forever stay with me. You've made me a forever fan <3""",2016-08-18 06:10:29,A Love Letter to Whiskey,romance;young-adult,Kandi Steiner

2178,676924,1,"""I love the world that P.C. and Kristin Cast created, however, I didn't like Marked, their first novel, very much. That being said, I was interesting in a few of the plot points and decided to read Betrayed to see if some of my questions were answered. 
 The plot, minus Zoey's love life, is interesting. Sadly, the characters are still so bland and one dimensional that I don't really care about it. Her friends are still cliche ridden and the twin stuff might be making be slightly crazy. The villain has potential to be really good though, so I'm interested in seeing how that route turns out...only I don't want to read the next book. Oh well. 
 I felt like Zoey became everything she hated in Betrayed. In terms of her love life, she blasted her former best friend and Aphrodite for being a hos, yet she cheats on her boyfriend. Sure she feels guilty about it, but it feels so good that she doesn't want to stop. 
 The situation with her teacher sounds interesting because you can easily tell Loren is evil and will do something messed up to her. But at the same time, Zoey should be able to feel his evil intentions, but doesn't because he is into her. I kind of think Zoey likes all the male attention and forgets about the real problem. Like the plot. 
 I will say that Heath and Aphrodite are my favourite characters in the novel. Heath is a love sick, addicted, puppy. He wants to be bitten and is developed well enough. Aphrodite grows the most in the novel and over shadows the rest of the characters. I wanted to read more about her than Zoey, which isn't good if Zoey is the main character in this novel. 
 Like I mentioned before, the plot is interesting. And that's pretty much it. Usually this would be okay, but the execution, the characters (minus Heath and Aphrodite) are annoying and Zoey is still a hardcore Mary Sue who craves male attention. The conversation between Zoey and the bad guy at the end of the novel didn't work for me either. Zoey increases her power, but it still feels forced and too perfect. The book is a bit better than Marked, when it comes to the plot, but it is still really bad.

2189,28755323,4,"""3.5 Stars (rounding up to 4) 
 I have a love/hate relationship with this book. 
 Basic gist: Vic tells the story to her boyfriend, Andrew, all about how she cheated on him, falling for the new guy at school, Z. The ending is OUT THERE. If you don't read books because of cheating, don't count this one out for that reason. Seriously. 
 What I loved: 
 I loved the bits of interviews, newspaper articles, and so on that preceded each chapter. They were little clues to the end game that kept me invested in the story, needing to know what happened. I loved that, until almost the final chapter, I had no clue where this was going. I didn't even know who was a good guy and who was a bad guy. I loved that it kept me guessing. 
 What I didn't care for: 
 I wasn't really invested in the day to day play-by-play that Vic was giving us. It bored me a little. I didn't like the decisions she made, though I understand that's part of her character, and I don't knock stars for that. I just didn't like some of the things she did. Actually, aside from her stupid decisions, I can kind of relate to Vic. She feels like an outsider, doesn't really feel like she belongs and can't connect to her peers. Gosh, that was me in high school! 
 As I read books I tend to have a star rating in mind, this one jumped quickly from about a 2 up to a 3.5. This is the kind of book that seemed, to me, tedious as I read it. But when I read that ending? Wow. Blew me away. I actually didn't quite understand what was happening until it was happening. Suddenly I was backpedaling, saying, WAIT! WHAT??? Yeah, it was good. So trippy. 
 So, do I recommend this book? Yes. But go into this knowing that the pacing is slow and steady, the clues are there, but you're unlikely to put it together until the very end. And you'll probably keep thinking about the story afterward, I know I did!

2191,59980,4,"""I could not really write a review for this. 1. It's a Graphic novel, the FIRST which I have ever read in my life (with Watchmen going to be my second), 2. It's a comic of Batman from the '80s. What is the problem with that? It's one of those circumstances into where a book is so iconic and so revolutionary that it cannot be really appreciated at a future time because the effects of how revolutionary for its time it was have seeped into culture and become a recognizable norm. This is a Batman I am used to; in fact, the only Batman which I have really known. This is the Batman that made me love Batman in the first place. But then think back to 1987, think back to when comics were different - again, I know nothing about comics so I take my opinion with a grain of salt - and I am sure you could see that this would be drastically different than what readers would be used to. When the demographic was younger and the medium much more immature and childish, this came and was more than that. Its praised for having a more gritty nature and for being realistic although it still has those tendencies to be a little too surreal to be down to earth or grounded so you still have to put on that suspension of disbelief. 
 I have heard much on Frank Miller (at least his writing, I'm not too keen on his opinions). Finally sitting down and seeing what a critically acclaimed graphic novelist has produced warranted my interest. It has a little bit of an action movie feel to it but I love how besides all those action sequences, it has those moments where it's just about Gordon (this book should be called Gordon: Year One) and it feels human and personal for a second. Because this is only the first book, Gotham still feels like a foreign place but with time, I am sure that the place will become more alive and those glimpses at great moments throughout this book will hit a marvelous peak somewhere down the line where everything will click and I'll feel how worth it the build up was. 
 This book warrants my appreciation for its historical significance to the genre, to the medium, to superheroes, and to the Batman who we know today. Even if it is sad that I cannot experience it as others did when it originally came out, I hold much appreciation for it now.

There are plants and animals whose names I don't recognize, and then every so often something very familiar shows up with the standard familiar name (like a maple tree). What...? I know this seems picky, but if you're going to spend time making up and describing new species, please, go whole hog and make it a different world entirely. 
 Second...eep, though I actually like the main character for some reason, he has some ""Larry Sue"" traits that I found deeply annoying and also sloppy. Unusually green eyes, that change hue repeatedly. Gag. Exceptionally bright red hair, magically bright, like a flame, also changeable with mood? Double-gag. A genius at everything he puts his hand to? Precocious learner, perfect memory, musical genius, magical genius. PUUUUKE. Sole survivor of a horrible tragedy, with a terrible, horrible childhood. COME. ON. I mean, Kvothe's main flaws are that he's too talented and can't shut up about it. He's impulsive and gets punished for it, but not so much so that he can't heal up after a chapter or so, and no one close to him (aside from the horrible tragedy he survives early on) suffers for it either. He's just, like, so awesome. BLEAH. 
 It's a testament to the author that I completed the book, even though the above are rather awful sins for an otherwise quite talented author to commit. I might actually read the second book in the trilogy, eventually. The details that he gets right are pretty fun, and I'm a sucker for magical educational institutions. The University is like Hogwarts but way better and more dangerous (could've used more of that, more of Kvothe's classmates, and way less of Kvothe's awesome awesomeness). The principles of magic are really great - I could've used a LOT LOT LOT more of them. The writing is good, and the plotting is good, or else I wouldn't have read the whole thing.

Lots of short sentences dripping with significance. This bugged me, until I remembered just now that that is how things seemed when I was a teen/young adult. My life was exactly that significant, to me, at the time. It's a fairly accurate internal monologue, not just an annoying author's choice. 
 Still annoying though, so only 3 stars.""",2010-07-16 07:54:36,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak

 Thrown together in school when Courtney arrives mid semester and sits next to Maggie in History class, these two polar opposites form a strong friendship that deepens into more. But time and life have a way of forcing hard decisions and not all is well in paradise. 
 Jump forward and Margaret is a successful realtor still living in the small town she grew up in, happy enough but aware of missed opportunities. When she bumps in to Courtney the overwhelming emotion is anger towards the woman who walked away. But as the author perfectly encapsulates, ""Just because you're through with your past, doesn't mean its through with you."" 
 This is another excellent romance from Melissa Brayden. The flashback is well done, the then and now always clear and well managed. The story arc is a perfect balance from anger through acceptance and into hope. The setting may be an extremely traditional American small town school and the strawberry farms of SoCal but it is extremely well drawn, evocative and full of sensual description. 
 Margaret and Courtney are both loveable and we cannot help want to see it all work out, to long for that HEA, through their trials and tribulations, their losses and pain. Margaret, with the perfect family and home life seems like the solid and strong character, while in fact it is Courtney with the domineering father and broken home who shows the strength both to leave when she can no longer bear the pain and come back to fight again. 
 In addition we have some excellent secondary characters, Margaret's parents and older brother are adorable, and her friends are well drawn characters who each have their own journey and growing to do as the timeline unfolds. The friendship between Maggie and Travis is fun, and Mel's growth from school bitch to good buddy is a great example of personal growth. 
 Ms Brayden always writes excellent traditional romances, full of beautiful women and witty dialogue, but this is my favourite to date. I felt it was more mature and had more depth. The tragedy is real, the angst well done without being over the top, and the character development palpable in both the main characters and their friends. While perhaps the then and now could have been more mixed, to intersperse the young adult angst with the more witty adult Ms Brayden is the master of, it felt more personal, with deeper emotions, and turned another good romance into a great one. I have no doubt this will be a favourite with many many romance readers, highly recommended.""",2017-04-23 00:18:57,Strawberry Summer,romance;young-adult;fiction,Melissa Brayden

2215,59980,4,"""I received this one as a birthday present around five months back and never got round to reading this. In fact, it has been almost a decade since I last picked up a comic book. Somewhere around moving from one place to another, sorting life after graduation, this one found itself buried and waiting. Two episodes of the new Flash down and one of the Arrow, then a few of The Walking Dead, and I hate this waiting. I prefer my comic manna to be delivered in a line, to be downed one after the other in quick intense sessions. That left me elbow deep in the still unopened boxes occupying almost half my room (procrastinator alert!) and I finally fished this one out . I took the picture below for my Instagram account months earlier. 
 This is a perfect introduction to the character of Batman and while I say that I realise that there probably isn't anyone who requires an introduction to this character. But this book is full of nifty little titbits. 
 The story traces from the beginnings of the dark hero. As the title suggests it begins the origin of batman, the origins which fork into two different timelines. A more gritty and acidic side to the hero as foreseen by Frank Miller and then, the more famous generic doppelganger. 
 The comic is a character study, and weirdly as I have come to associate with Miller, not a study of our Knight himself, but rather of the Police Commissioner Gordon who is then Lieutenant Gordon. Whereas the bat inspires fear, Gordon lends a more relatable and humane taste to the story. It is weird, because it being a story of the origin of Batman, would treat him more as a garnish, but it works. Those familiar with the Tv series Gotham, could find this in the same alley. A corrupt city decaying and retching from its own stench, and an even more corrupt police force and our one man army fighting to survive against it and overcome the odds. This is Gordon. But he isn't heroism personified. He is a deeply flawed character and as often found battling against himself as he is found avenging the city. 
 Contrary to the Tv, the Bat isn't a kid here. He is grown up and is the more shadowy figure who serves the vigilante angle, a little less cocksure of himself, and sometimes stumbling on his feet. He has just returned from training and we get to see him on his first night out as a vigilante. He is not yet a bat. The inspiration is yet to strike him. And he fumbles. Here we are introduced to the hero who is yet in the making and is a long long way to being the person who will eventually face Ra's al Ghul or even Bane. 
 Catwoman makes an appearance here as a prostitute, although her story is redefined in a later issue as a thief who pretends to be a prostitute in order to steal. As far as covers for crime go, I am not sure I follow this one as thoroughly. 
 A classic story with a very distinct goth feel. This one was reminiscent of the old superhero movies. The artwork left a lot to be desired. And I missed the emotional connection with this. There was no black hole left behind after the final page was turned. It was power packed but not packed enough. Still, it was an enjoyable read and should definitely be counted as a must read.""",2015-10-18 10:12:29,Batman: Year One,comics;graphic;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;fantasy;paranormal;young-adult,Frank Miller;David Mazzucchelli;Richmond Lewis;Dennis O'Neil

 From the first chapter- from the first page, really- I was hooked on this. Perkins does an amazing job of writing these suspenseful and tension-filled scenes that gave me chills and, at times, literally made me scream. Like, out loud. It was that good. 
 What makes this book really great, though, is that it's way more than just a gore-filled bloodbath. In between all the grisly murder scenes is actually a really sweet romance. I also enjoyed Makani as a character, especially finding out about her backstory and seeing her growth as a person. There are also strong friendships and diverse characters, including Makani herself. All of this helps to heighten the tension because it gives you people to root for and, of course, be scared for.

A lot of people were excited that I was reading it and I heard so many good things about it that in some ways, it was doomed to fall short. 
 It's not that I didn't like The Name of the Wind. It's actually a quick and pleasant read. It is a bit different than the usual fantasy I read and I appreciate that. The book just wasn't that exciting. The main character is a bit of a Mary Sue who can't do much wrong. The framing device makes it hard for me to believe in the tension, since I knew that nothing really bad could happen to our protagonist if he's telling a story about his past. 
 I didn't understand the point of Denna, the femme fetale. There was no explanation to her and our main character, who's usually so curious and full of questions never really examines her. I know she's supposed to be a force that every man is attracted to, but I found it hard to believe. She didn't seem to serve much of a purpose throughout the whole story. I kept waiting for some twist to happen with her where she turned out to be some evil person but nope nothing happened.

 Batman Year One is a riveting origin piece by Frank Miller. It is not just Batman who makes an appearance in the squalid Gotham city but Lieutenant James Gordon with his pregnant wife Barbara also attempts a fresh start. 
 The story is told from both Gordon and Bruce's perspective. In the first issue both men take account of the sordid unsavory reputation of the police department, corrupt and rotten to the core, with no regard to human lives. Both Gordon and Bruce will learn from their mistakes. Gordon, the man who is thought to be incorruptible will fall from better judgment into a salacious scandal and Bruce would repeatedly get stabbed and shot in the beginning. 
 The issue highlights the struggle of Bruce Wayne as he searches for a way to fulfill his destiny. Fighting crime is not enough as he must find a way to instill fear in the hearts of criminals. 
 In this series you get to see James Gordon in a lot of action, and not just some ingenious detective work but hard boiled baseball-bat-on-the-shoulder action. Surprisingly, for me, James Gordon is the man who steals the show. Fighting his way through punches, his verbal remarks polished with a subtle crudeness makes a marked resemblance with Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade. 
 The comic is a piece of artistic marvel; expressive with an uncanny attention to detail. David Mazzucchelli has done a remarkable job illustrating the Gotham city from its filthy streets to the opulent window panes of sky high buildings. 
 The issue also introduces catwoman and briefly Harvey Dent. The comic work with timelines that keep readers abreast with the time lapsed from one scene to another.

 Historical fiction about the life of an old Hollywood movie star, Laura Lamont. Beginning life in Door County, Wisconsin as Elsa Emerson, Elsa has an idyllic childhood as the youngest daughter of a local community theater director until the unexpected suicide of her oldest sister, Hildy. This early loss informs her life and is the impetus to her leaving Door County for Los Angeles. The rest of the novel traces Laura's early unhappy marriage, discovery by a famous Hollywood producer (and a happy marriage to him), the heights of movie star fame in the 1940s and the decline into obscurity and has-been status in the 1950s and 1960s before an eventual return to the theatre in her old age. 
 I liked the book but I found the narrative style (3rd person limited) to distance me from the characters. Laura was the protagonist and heroine but her inner life seemed limited and the plot seemed to be hitting the high points of her life without going deeper. It was fun to guess at the real life inspirations for several of the characters: her husband, Irving Green was obviously based on Irving Thalberg, and her best friend Ginger was based on Lucille Ball.

 REVIEW: When I saw The Collector available in NetGalley I was static. The Collector was one of the most anticipated Paranormal YA books of April and there is a reason. This is a fast pace story in which good has to fight evil and where evil comes in the form of a bad boy named Dante Walker. His personality along with his looks makes good girls really bad. Dante Walker's job as The Collector is to seal or stamp your soul so that when you die the ""Boss Man"" as he calls the devil takes possession of your soul. 
 On the other side of the spectrum we have Charlie, a sweet and kind girl who makes everyone and everything around her feel better. These two characters are quite different, while Dante goes around ""stamping souls"" and being a wise-ass, Charlie goes around helping people and passing around hope and love. 
 I'll admit I did not like much of Dante's behavior throughout half of the book. He was arrogant, insufferable, immature and annoying. However, as the story progressed he grew on me. There are many things to enjoy about this book & Dante as a character; some readers will find Dante funny and cute, and at times adorable. Others will find him annoying, childish and selfish. I think Dante was funny and a total jackass at times, which I must admit to have enjoyed. However, as the story developed his attitude and outlook of life as well as his job as a collector changed. I did enjoy his character because he made the story fun and entertaining, his character gave the story the necessary twist and spark. Though his actions were at times predictable his character was able to maintain a level of uncertainty that made the story a lot more interesting. 
 Charlie, on the other hand, is sweet, honest, and always sees the good in people. She isn't exactly what I call a great heroine, but her maturity and fantastic personality won my heart. She is what one would call a good soul. After a terrible accident took away her parents, Charlie's life changed and so did her purpose for living. She was born with a purpose in life and that purposed was what caught the ""Boss Man"" attention. The way Dante and Charlie interacted was sweet, other characters such as Blue & Annabelle were great and added the perfect balance to the story. Overall, The Collector is an entertaining story of redemption, love and understanding. It is also a story where love and hope can be found even in the darkest of souls and where friendship is highly valued. Victoria Scott did a good job putting these two very different characters together. This series has all the necessary ingredients to be a hit, it has great characters who are matured and smart, it has romance & action. I recommend this book to readers who enjoy self-centered, chatty, wise-ass and compassionate characters. Did you hear? Dante has cause mass hysteria in the YA Paranormal world.

To me, the purpose of a novel is to get at emotional truths about life, emotion, psychological knots--all those messy yet necessary aspects of human relationships--in a way that straight historical facts can't. The Paris Wife relied too much on historical veneer (fun as it was), stringing well-known facts about the culture of American ex-pats in Paris without delving far below the surface. 
 However, I'm unfamiliar enough with the 1920's Paris scene (outside of the film Midnight in Paris, heh) that I appreciated the opportunity to be a fly on the wall.

 This isn't my typical kind of summer read. This is the sort of story I would search out if it were a film, but with books I tend to gravitate towards darker, weirder genre efforts. However, whenever I looked up the 'best books of 2014,' Anthony Doerr's latest novel kept popping up on all the lists. So, I figured what the hell and gave it a go. 
 The story takes place during WWII and follows a young blind girl from France named Marie-Laure and a young boy from Germany named Werner. The blind girl has only her father and a love of books. Werner has only his sister Jutta. When the German's invade France, Marie-Laure and her father are forced to evacuate from their home and search for her uncle. It's not long before her father is taken away, leaving the young blind girl with relatives she has never known. Werner is similarly separated from those whom he loves as he is trained and schooled to be the future of the Third Reich. Any letters he sends to his sister Jutta are heavily censored or do not arrive at all. At its core this is the story of two young, innocent children who are forced into the ugliness of the war, both of them victims in some way, neither of them innocent for long. 
 But it is more than that. It's a story of deceptive simplicity, one that manages to say much about the world and its people, while it seems to tell the story of individuals far removed from the troubles of today. 
 It's a book about the invisible ties that bring us together. The strength of family. The bond of friendship and love. Much of the story takes place in two separate places, detailing the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner. As the book progresses, Marie-Laure and her uncle find themselves doing radio broadcasts for the French resistance. At the same time, Werner makes a name for himself in his young troop as he is able to repair electronics and intercept radio broadcasts. Destiny's invisible pathways will one day lead our two young characters to intercept. 
 Tragedy seems to be inevitable in a story such as this. And maybe it is. But Doerr has other things on his mind than simply telling us a sad story. He wants to charm us with beautiful language and wonderful characters. I came to love and care for both Marie-Laure and Werner. This book is one of the few that I can say that I became so emotionally involved with that there might've been a tear or two shed while reading it. 
 All the Light We Cannot See deserves all the praise it gets. It's a fantastic book, one filled with beautiful, effortless prose and characters that will stay with you forever.

 Updated 8/11/2013 
 That was outstanding. And for a first novel? Incredible. 
 It was recommended by a couple EQ2 guildies and later, on a Game of Thrones read-alike list. 
 I can see why it ended up on the list. One could also put it on a Harry Potter read-alike list (for adults, as Suzie pointed out!). But Rothfuss has his own (wonderful) unique voice. I enjoyed the main character very much...especially his intelligence, stubborn perseverance, and ingenuity. I loved the storytelling - the foreshadowing, the twists and turns of the tale, and Rothfuss's take on common lore (plus the addition of his own). The world building was excellent, the book has plenty of great quotes, lots of well written scenes. Really enjoyed all the characters as well. 
 I cannot wait to read the next one, but must get through some others first. It's going to be hard to shift gears to go from this book to another I'm not as excited about! 
 Edit to add 8/11/2013 - we've been revisiting this as an audiobook, started on a road trip last week. The narration starts out a bit rough, since he's narrating Old Cobb telling his story - give it a bit, it gets better. Once he gets to the university, the narration turns fantastic with the accents and Ambrose the little pr###. 
 It's striking me more in the audiobook than it did in written form what a very short period of time it takes for Kvothe to get himself into all kinds of trouble at the University. He's kind of an ""out of the frying pan into the fire...and another fire...and hey another fire..."" sorta guy. You can see the trainwreck coming a mile away, but the character is too headstrong or distracted to avoid it. 
 Further, having seen Rothfuss giving a couple talks on Youtube, I see a great deal of the author in the teenage character, especially the university phase - there's a quality I can't quite put my finger on... it goes along with stubborn...it's not quirky (though that could certainly fit)... it's not ""mischievous"" (though again, that could fit) - there's more scheming to it, but it's not deviousness. Craftiness. That will have to do. I think it is what you get in a gentle, but strong willed - perhaps ADHD - child who has been beat up on the playground and finds a clever (but ultimately gross overkill) way to strike back. The same way my husband - sick of his brother punching him - stuck a screwdriver up his sleeve and told his brother ""punch me as hard as you can!""",2011-10-20 20:08:31,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 Overall Opinion: This was actually better than I thought it'd be. I don't have that many ""triggers"" in books, and I can deal with cheating usually -- so it didn't bother me that we have cheating in this book, but I think it's good to put it out there for those that are bothered by it. This reminded me a lot of the The Avoiding Series Boxset, because these two were just constantly tested (and usually failed) when reunited through the years. I definitely had moments of wanting to shake the h because of her pushing away the H at times, but I also understood her hang-ups and where it all came from. I felt their connection and wanted them to get their act together so much that I was truly disappointed with the ending.  I wanted some time with them as an actual couple! We get that they ended up together and are married , but that wasn't enough! Through the years, they only get brief moments of time together and are never an official couple that we experience -- and I think we needed that! . The ending is the main reason for my rating being what it was, because otherwise I really did enjoy this book :) 
 Brief Summary of the Storyline: This is B and Jamie's story. They meet in high school. Even though they both were instantly attracted, the timing never seems right for the two. After spending more and more time together they become best friends and develop a strong connection, but there is also an underlying attraction that is hard for them to ignore. This is their story over the years, and how they dealt with their strong connection and attraction while trying to balance on that line of friendship. 
 POV: This was told in B's POV. 
 Overall Pace of Story: Good until the end. I never skimmed and I thought it flowed well. I did feel like the ending was too abrupt though. 
 Instalove: No, they take a while in developing stronger feelings. 
 H rating: 4 stars. Jamie. I liked him. I appreciated his ability to put it all out there for the h. 
 h rating: 4 stars. B. I liked her. She was just really weak at times when it came to the H and wanting him, and also pushing him away. 
 Sadness level: Moderate. I teared up quite a bit (but never ugly cried) once I hit around the 75% mark. I was expecting to cry throughout, but I am happy I didn't. 
 Push/Pull: Yes They both pursue and push away at times in the relationship at times.  
 Heat level: Moderate. They have some hot chemistry and scenes, but not so much that it takes away from the story. 
 Descriptive sex: Yes 
 Safe sex: Yes. Condoms are used. I don't remember any mention of past practices. 
 OW/OM drama: Yes Both h and H are with other people during the story that causes drama for both of them.  
 Sex scene with OW or OM: No 
 Cheating: Yes  Both h and H cheat on their significant others with each other (H once and h twice)  
 Separation: Yes  They have quite a few separations, and both of them have been with other partners during these separations.  
 Possible Triggers: Yes  Cheating and h is the result of a rape (and Dad is present)  
 Closure: This didn't have nearly enough closure for me. I think this is my biggest complaint about the book. I would (reluctantly) call it a HEA. 
 How I got it: I got it with my kindle unlimited subscription. 
 Safety: I'd say that this is probably Not Safe for the safety gals.

 Overall Opinion: I really was liking this for the first part of the book, as I do tend to enjoy relationships that develop over something like texting/phone calls/letters/emails. Once they physically met we do get the hot sexy times, but we also go the lovey-dovey stuff that just isn't my cuppa. I like to feel the connections between the characters, and I felt like I was just constantly told about it instead through long(ish) inner monologues and cheesy dialogue. I know that some readers love that stuff, but I am ok in accepting that I am just a grouch when it comes to the cheesefests! ;). I also had really big issues with the major conflict being presented so late, and it also being resolved way too easily. So -- I'm going with a middle-of-the-road rating because I did enjoy the first part, but sadly couldn't connect with the last. 
 Brief Summary of the Storyline: This is Sydney and Brian's story. The story starts with Sydney moving in with her best friend after her husband calls off her marriage. She is mad at men in general, and gets an idea to call the jerk that hurt her friend recently and give him a piece of her mind. She lets into him, but soon finds out that she got Brian instead when she dialed the wrong number. He thoroughly enjoyed the lashing he received, and makes contact via text the next day. They start a friendship though texts and phone calls, and soon become the highlight of each other's day. Eventually, their friendship turns into more and they start developing stronger feelings. They take a while to meet because of some events in Brian's past are holding him back, but once they do - they quickly fall in love. There still are big obstacles for them to get around...and they get a HFN ending. 
 POV: This alternated between Sydney and Brian's POV. 
 Overall Pace of Story: Ok. I did feel like their big conflict was way too close to the ending (87%) and was resolved way too easily for my tastes. I did skim a few times when things got a little too mushy for me ;) 
 Instalove: No, they develop a friendship that turns into more. 
 H rating: 4 stars. Brian. I liked him. I felt really bad for his past and his guilt, as well as the mess he got himself into by the time he meets the h. I liked the way he loved her. 
 h rating: 3 stars. Sydney. Eh, she was just ok. Nothing to hate and nothing to love either IMO. 
 Sadness level: Low. No tissues needed. 
 Push/Pull: Yes The H doesn't want to meet the h because of his porn and his past, so he pushes her away when she wants to meet in person. The h pushes away at one point near the end after some drama. They both pursue the relationship at times.  
 Heat level: Moderate/high. They had some hot chemistry and scenes, but it felt like it became filler at times when we could've gotten some more substantial scenes instead. 
 Descriptive sex: Yes 
 Safe sex: Yes and no. They go without anything the first time together -- but they do talk about birth control and STD status (after the fact). The H had never gone without protection before, but the h did with her husband (in the past)  
 OW/OM drama: A little The h is recently separated from her husband, and he causes a little drama.  
 Sex scene with OW or OM: No but we get some vague details of the porn shots the H did  
 Cheating: Not IMO The h is technically married, but her husband asked for a separation before she had any contact with the H. They are legally separated earlier in the story (and before anything physical happens with the H). The H still does masterbation porn after their relationship changed to being more intimate (still over the phone)  
 Separation: Yes  They have a few short separations, and there was no mentions or suggestions of other partners during either separation.  
 Possible Triggers: Yes  H was an internet porn star (and up until they had phone sex and their relationship changed, he changed to doing only solo shows. He quit completely once he physically met her), loss of a sibling, h is married (though separated), and abandonment by parent (h).  
 Closure: This had ok closure with what I would call a HFN ending. (See overall pace section above). They are planning on getting married once her divorce is final (but not referring each other as ""fiance"" yet), and they are living together  
 How I got it: I paid the $3.99 on Amazon for it. 
 Safety: I'd call this one either Safe with exception or Not Safe depending on personal preferences (mainly because of one of the H's professions)

2244,186074,3,"""Where to start? I feel like I have so many thoughts, yet I am already exhausted from reading it. I know people love this book, and I get it. The story is super fun, it's a really interesting, complete world, and who doesn't love a magic university? A lot of it is legitimately funny. It's easy to get caught up in the chain of events, and to be concerned about the outcome. 
 But at the same time, it's like reading a teenage boy's ultimate spank story. The main guy is buff and talented and smarter than everyone else and smooth with the ladies. And he's modest about it, everything is always ""aww shucks, I just happened to be really smart and really strong and really clever and saved this nice young lady from a Bad Dude."" He basically rolls through life being winsome and overcoming adversity. When he broods, it is sensitive and poignant. The whole thing feels like what a 15 year old boy assumes is attractive to women. I am fatigued. What would be more attractive to this woman is if the ratio of characters of substance wasn't at about 15:1 men to women.""",2017-05-04 18:31:11,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
2245,1756518,2,"""This was a little disappointing. I had been eager to pick it up after reading a blurb somewhere about this YA novel about Cubs fans. For some reason on which even I am not entirely clear, I know a lot of Cubs fans, so I thought this would be a fun read and then I could pass it along to someone else who would appreciate it. Now, I'm not sure it's worth sharing, it's too maudlin. 
 The basic set-up is that high school freshman Ryan's love of the Cubs was instilled by her dad, who died when she was 10. Throughout the book, we get glimpses of her happy memories of growing up with her dad and the Cubs. She meets a cute boy who also likes the Cubs. And after this, the book gets SADDER. Even more sad things happen to poor Ryan. It's miserable. It's like reading Love Story when you're 14: you're crying so hard you're choking on your own snot, but in the back of your mind you feel dirty because you know it's cloying and ridiculous. Maybe love is not winning a World Series in 100+ years? 
 Also, it's written in the present tense which I tend to find abrasive in anything novel-length. 
 There were a few ideas put forward in the sports-related portions that read nicely and felt true. In particular, I liked the characters' pondering of the differences between believing, hoping, and caring if your team is going to win in the future. There was more than one mention of how it's not as fun to like a team that wins a lot ... and I cannot imagine that is true. Yankees fan have too much fun, in my opinion. It would be seemly if they had less fun. 
 Grade: C+ 
 Recommended: Oy. Even though some of the baseball parts are pretty decent, anyone who is even remotely a sports fan has encountered those concepts in other, better places. Truth be told, if I had read this when I was 12, I probably would have enjoyed sobbing my way through several re-reads.

Robert Neville is a survivor of the apocalypse, as he scavenges the city area for provision, and locks himself indoors protected by stakes and fences, from the monsters who roam the world after sun set. 
 This far, so good: the movie adaption with Will Smith follows the same pattern but in the story by Matheson, the creatures know Neville is in the house, as they trying to manipulate and lure him outdoors by communication. In this prison, Neville drinks heavily as the story is bounded by monologues about life and death, longing and self-debating. As the story develops he starts to reflect on reasons and cures to this plague and commences warfare. 
 Stupidly enough when I'm comparing the publishing year of 1954 to the movie version of 2007, I feel there is a lot of potential. The language, tone and vampires are out of date to make this a scary encounter (looking it from today). Nevertheless the theme and the idea feels ahead of time, and could easily be regarded as something modern. The story is very personal and captures interest from the reading. There is never a dull moment. More detailed than the movie, which gives an understanding to the situation.

 It's basically the story of Kvothe's life, told by Kvothe (now an ""ordinary"" innkeeper called Kote). Storytelling is apparently something he's very good at, growing up as a traveler and performer; one of the Eduma Ruh. It's something Patrick Rothfuss is extremely good at too. Everything from the adventures and characters to the way of writing is fascinating and intriguing. I don't think it has all the usual fantasy feeling, but it's different in a good way. 
 As you understand pretty early into the book, Kvothe hasn't had a normal life so far. He's been beaten more times than he can count, watched his family die, seen someone call the name of the wind, gotten into the University (aka Hogwarts for young adults/adults) way younger than the average age, and never seem to afford more than one pair of clothes. 
 He's an interesting character too: clever, witty, adventurous, musical, charming, and everything else you could think of basically. He almost sounds boringly perfect, but more often than not his restlessness, big-mouth and wits get the best of him. It's something that proves he's human after all. Also he's terribly bad with women, which is a great shame but also a great joke for his friends. 
 I've read it at least four times now, same with the next book in the series: The wise man's fear. I can't really be trusted with not throwing it in people's faces to get them to read it. I'm not saying it's for everyone, but I definitely think everyone should read it anyway. Even if you don't like this type of book I think it's worth a try. It's very genuine and honest, even though I get the feeling Kvothe makes himself look a little better sometimes during the story-telling. I know it's a story, and stories can be fixed, even if it's his. It makes me distrust the book itself. What a weird feeling that is. I guess that's another thing I like about it. Anyway it's awesome and I would recommend it to everyone over the age of 12 who can read.

I could tell there was a backstory I was missing out on but it wasn't too bad. It earned a shiny four stars from me and I knew it was a series I wanted to continue. So, now I'm starting in proper order. Yay! 
 Beauty Dates the Beast is the first installment in Jessica Sims's adult, urban fantasy series titled: Midnight Liaisons. Midnight Liaisons is the name of a paranormal dating service (matchmaking not escort) that brings together all kinds of romance-seeking members of the supernatural community. Humans are definitely not included. However, awkward circumstances bring together our werecougar hero and very human heroine. Romance ensues, also a little mystery, a lot of suspense, some unnecessary drama (IMO), and a crazy horror-filled ending that brings everything together. All in all, Beauty Dates the Beast is a strong series starter that I'm glad I didn't miss. It sets up for book two beautifully and I might just have to re-read that one again...you know, to make sure I get them all ;)

I had never read anything from this author or this series before and I have to admit the popularity and impressive ratings had me pretty excited. This book ended up just being OK for me. I never really felt engaged in the storyline or connected with any of the characters. It was too easy to put the book down while reading and I kind of had a ""take it or leave it"" outlook. I considered adding it to my DNF shelf, not because it's bad but because there are too many books and too little time to read something that isn't completely capturing you. But I stuck it out...I mean have you seen how many books are in this series????? It's obviously working for plenty of loyal readers. 
 I should note there were things I did like about A Quick Bite: I liked the fact that the female lead is the vampire while the male lead is the mortal. Usually it's always the man who wears the fangs. I also thought the blood phobia was an interesting addition to the vampire world. I mean, who would have thought lol?

2253,19398490,4,"""All the Light We Cannot See is a historical fiction novel written by Anthony Doerr. The numerous awards, nominations, and generous reviews speak for themselves in terms of this book's quality, so I debated whether or not to even write a review. But obviously I did. Here it goes... 
 All the Light We Cannot See is a long book made up of short chapters and frequently alternating perspectives and timeframes. This style created some confusion for me, even to the point when I questioned if this was a book of similar-themed short stories instead of a fluid novel. After some time though, I became more accustomed to the writing style and it became easier to follow. However, any confusion/frustration I experienced was immediately cloaked by the stunning writing. I'm talking lyrical, quote-worthy, print-it-out-and-hang-it-up-on-my-wall writing. I wanted it to keep going. 
 Mr. Doerr adds beauty to an atrociously dark time in history through historical details, interesting characters, and metaphoric writing. I internalized this novel in several different ways. First, just recognizing the light of human existence. The amazing fact that we are alive. Yes, life can get hopelessly dark at times but I believe there is something good to be found in every circumstance if we look hard enough. Second, remembering the light of those before us. Their experiences, hopes, dreams...life is much too short as it is and it's a tragedy when people and their stories go unremembered. Third, the light of childhood innocence and the miracle of resiliency. This element was especially powerful (and harrowing) to me as many of the characters in this novel were children during wartime. Parts were difficult to read. 
 When we look at history, it is easy to just see dates, groups from this side and that side, and outcomes, but history is made up of individual lives who existed and held their own unique story. Remember that next time you watch a history program, listen to a lecture, or acknowledge a dark moment from long ago. History is a revolving door; it is always in the making. People will forever share the stories of world wars and rightfully so - we learn from the past. But those who come after us will also learn from today's moments. Sadly, our chapter in the history books may already be set in stone, but we can each leave our individual legacy of kindness, generosity, and the pure joy of being alive. 
 My favorite quote: 
 ""Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever."" 
 Note: Our present day world is encountering dark times that appear to be growing darker. It seems hatred, violence, and closed doors come easier than generosity and kindness these days. However, there are moments of beauty to cling to. No matter what country we live, no matter our religion, race, sexual/gender orientation, or customs, we are all humans inhabiting the same planet, breathing the same air, fighting the same war against our humanity. If you ever feel you need a reminder of this or you simply want to celebrate it, consider checking out Brandon Stanton's blog titled Humans of New York to learn about your neighbors near and far. I highly recommend his interviews that shed light on the refugee crisis.

But now I'm really able to appreciate how skillfully and thoughtfully it was crafted. Rothfuss, like a full-blooded bard, weaves a wonderful, enthralling tale of practically mythical hero who still manages to be relatable, imperfect and wholly endearing, without being an insufferable golden-boy know-it-all that never loses. With twists and turns, failures and successes, heroes and villains (sometimes inhabiting the same body), the story slowly works its magic on you, until you've fallen in love with every single character and element of the world. Warm, yet hard and bleak when it needs to be, it meanders and pulls you in so you're unable to put it down - I started book two as soon as I turned the page on this one.

2255,17325147,5,"""I can't believe I'm the worst fangirl ever and I hadn't put my review here. Amended from full review at PenandMuse.com 
 I absolutely adore Jessica Park - as a writer, an entertainer, and a human being. She hasn't disappointed me yet. 
 What I love about Jessica Park novels is how easy it is to relate to the main characters. I became Blythe. I could associate her thoughts with my own life. I was consumed by her, her drama, and oh my heavens Chris. I absolutely love the voice she instantly creates with her characters. You're thrust inside their world, and you're unable to do anything but belong to it. 
 This is a story about real people. Doing things that real people do. This is a real fucking story. There's masturbation, steamy sex scenes, and neurotic girl thoughts - because let's be serious, all of these are 100% accurate in a New Adult's life. 
 Left Drowning is about facing reality - even if it isn't always as pretty as you want it to be. It's intense. Honest. Raw. I scribbled notes about my own life in the metaphoric margins of the book. I sighed. I swooned. I gasped. I shrieked. I cried. I loved every single character. I wanted more of every single character. I got lost, tangled, and swept away into their lives. 
 We all have our stories. Something we survived. Something that changed us even if we were left floundering in the water, left drowning. This is what the book is about. Surviving. Choosing to live. Being that phoenix rising from the ash. 
 Left Drowning goes into the category of ""What wouldn't I give to get my grabby hands on a signed copy of this to sit on my shelves and look pretty?"" Easily. Can we all go buy her books now and convince her to write a quadrillion books a year? Because my life would be a million times better with more Jessica Park novels in it. 
 All jokes aside, I'm keeping all my digits crossed for any additional novels/novellas with these characters. I could relate to the characters of FLAT-OUT LOVE, but this? Every single character dug their nails right into my soul, and are making no efforts to leave anytime soon. 
 My advice: Read this book NOW.""",2013-07-05 11:20:03,"Left Drowning (Left Drowning, #1)",romance;young-adult;fiction,Jessica Park
2256,186074,3,"""A unique fantasy ""memoir"" that is far more story than action, at least for this, the first third of the trilogy. Of course, that doesn't mean it's boring. It may be a bit longer than it really needs to be, but it held my attention quite well, regardless. And the writing is beautifully subtle and intricate, complex in a way that is still easy to read, which is quite a feat. 
 Still, the combination of slow movement and little action did combine to mean that I did not gush over this book as many do. If it had been either a bit more exciting, or a bit less verbose, I might have enjoyed it more. Either way, though, it's a solid book and gripping enough that I immediately started the second book, with a little bit of hope that we start to see a bit more action as Kvothe gets along in years and experience.""",2011-02-16 06:07:48,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
2257,4954833,5,"""Wonderful book, in a way that you might not notice. The story proceeds quietly with just enough context to keep the focus on Eilis. 
 If you have not seen the film, I recommend reading the book first. The screenplay follows the book very closely, but Saoirse Ronan's Eilis owns the character. If you'd rather have your own Eilis first, her performance will make that impossible. Her Eilis is even more rich than the novel's. She really shows the slow mixing of Ireland and Brooklyn in her character over the course of the movie. 
 As I read, I was continually amazed at how good Nick Hornby's screenplay is. Much of the book happens inside Eilis' head, and all that needs to be told visually. The screenplay follows the book very closely, but adds and drops a few scenes to tell the emotional truth of the story. For example, the screenplay adds a sequence where Eilis learns to overcome her Irish deference to the shop customers and instead look them in the eye and smile like an American. The added dialogue where Eilis tells off Mrs. Kelly is the prime example of that. It isn't in the book, but it makes Eilis in charge of the decision to return to Tony, no matter what.

 The book only tells the love story between the super-fantastic-perfect-female protagonist and three super-fantastic-perfect-male protagonists. She wants to fuck them all, basically. 
 And then there's Aphrodite, whose story I would like to know but, since I'm not going to continue with this series (I considere it a loss of time...), I'm not going to know it and that won't let me without sleep.

I mean, there's very little urgency in the main character where the message delivery is concerned. She spends days on the road without getting closer to the capital. She magically finds help when all hope is lost. She doesn't show much agency and then there is the lack of logic. Obviously in a kingdom which doesn't enjoy modern technology, there will need to be a network of messengers because information needs to shared so why aren't there safer, faster, ways to go about delivering messages? How do other messengers fare or are we to believe that no other information is shared between provinces or whatever the areas are called? How far off is the capital anyway? The lack of worldbuilding also presented an obstacle to my enjoyment. I reached 108 pages where she managed to get captured by mercenaries. Skipping ahead showed me that she remains captured for longer than she is on the road. And that was it.

2263,12985143,4,"""Hemlock has many strengths but one of the most fascinating aspects of it is the atmosphere that infuses the narrative intermittently and fragments the novel in a way that, instead of making the novel choppy, makes it flow smoother. Peacock's imagery is very strong but there is subtlety to it that I liked very much. This subtlety is most apparent in scenes when Mackenzie is conversing with Amy in one of her dreams. The stillness of the setting coupled with the Amy's ghostly visage that has a mixture of cruelty and vulnerability to it is superbly transmitted through Peacock's writing. 
 Moving into the review proper, let me discuss the aspects of the novel itself. Even though it is constructed as a paranormal romance, at the heart of it, the novel is a whodunit. A crime story that has a reveal that I, for once, did not predict. Mackenzie is an easy protagonist to empathize with. Her fierceness where her friends are concerned sound sincere and work in her favour. There is a love triangle but for once, I did not have much trouble working with it as Mac does not lead on one of the guys. This is not to imply that there is no ambiguity in her feelings in the beginning because there is but for the most part, Mac's romantic feelings are very clear and I appreciated that. 
 That said, there were still some issues that I had with the novel. The first was that the mythology, the werewolf-ery is not very well explored. That might be because Peacock is saving that for the next book (which very well might be the case) but I would have liked a lot more information on what being a werewolf entails. The other is the presence of the multiple Mean Girls. I wish authors would realize that perpetuating this mean girl trope works to create divides in girls and while I'm not from the school of naive thought that teaches all girls share a common sisterhood, I do believe that the portrayal of such characters lead to normalizing them. So yeah, no bueno. 
 These issues aside, I really did enjoy the novel. I thought it was well constructed, paced and characterized. The trackers were frightening and gave a glimpse to the depths humanity can sink to defend itself. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good murder mystery populated by werewolves, crazy people and spunky heroines.""",2010-11-13 19:49:44,"Hemlock (Hemlock, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Kathleen Peacock
2264,8369680,4,"""Wishful Thinking is the companion novel to Bullen's debut novel Wish and it continues in the same vein as the first book. Ms. Bullen writes a beautiful story. She takes magical elements and weds them to very real conflicts with an expertise that has the reader charmed. I loved the complex relationships in the novel. The depth of the protagonist's desire for a family was exquisitely portrayed. The characters in the novel came to life on the island setting and, in the most empathetic of ways, the author shows the reader what if feels like to be in search for a mother, for a family. 
 I also loved how, even though the story is about wishes and how they are granted, the narrative shows that sometimes what we wish for is not what we need. Basically, this is a contemporary novel dressed up as somewhat supernatural but more like magical realism. I did have some issue with the romantic plot but I guess that too was part and parcel of Hazel's growing up, her journey.

That boy goes on to attend a very highly esteemed school that trains magician types, which is governed by nine masters of magic (one of which is called the Master Namer and is reclusive and eccentric). While there, this boy is subjected to the disdain of older, richer boys who are by far the protagonist's inferiors. The boy gets accolades and praise, and kills a dragon. All throughout the boy is looking for the name of something very important, and there is an incredibly beautiful and mysterious woman who appears and disapears with little logic or warning.

 Yeah, The Name of the Wind isn't like A Wizard of Earthsea at all.

 What was good: I like Kvothe as a boy. The magic (sympathy) was interesting and original, if a bit technical. The explanation of the ""dragon"" was believable. All the characters were well-developed. 
 What was not-so-good: Too many young, attractive, female characters; I lost track of who was a love interest, and who was not. The character of Auri was unnecessary. Some points were a bit long and tedious.

 Warning: There may be gushing. 
 Patrick Rothfuss, is a Whedon fan nerd (seriously go check out his author page). That right there, should tell you something. The Name of the Wind, had been on my list for awhile. After reading some seriously mediocre books I was craving a good long fantasy novel. I love a good long read, especially if it's well done. The Name of the Wind, had everything I was looking for and then blew right past my expectations. Mind, blown. 
 I must say in many ways, I enjoyed this more than Game of Thrones. While they can barely be compared, the emotions and attitude towards this tome were decidedly more positive and engaging than the violence and betrayal of Game of Thrones. There are no never ending lists of food or gratuitous descriptions of torture. More people live than die and ultimately there is a sense of hope and wonderment that weaves throughout The Name of the Wind. 
 Even with its length, I was never bored. I hung on every word, every story, every character. I cannot remember the last time I became this invested in a book. The world building was genius, the use of magic (sympathy), made perfect sense and played liked alchemy in a Final Fantasy game. The multiple threads of Kvothe's character through music, intellect, wit, adventurousness, heroics and conscience are so brilliantly weaved, you can't help but love him and be amazed by his journey. 
 The Point: A staple for fantasy (and non-fantasy) story lovers, with poignant prose, phenomenal character development, and just damn good storytelling. Worthy of multiple reads. 
 The Audiobook: I can't say anything bad about the audiobook. It was perfect, the pacing, emotions, multiple characterizations, were played brilliantly by Nick Podehl. Except for one thing. He is too young for Kvothe or he needed to be english.

 This book is so incredibly intricate, yet easy to follow. There are so many characters but it isn't

The story line and plot are so good and keep the reader hooked. And I'm not usually in to slow books. I like something fast-paced that gets to the point. I guess in this book there are just so many points to get to, so much happens. 
 The only thing is that I wish i had not chose to read this so close to finals just because it's so long and I would have liked to of had some more time to read it all together since it is so long.

2269,28963772,3,"""3.25-3.5 stars. This was a pretty good read. This is Sydney and Brian's story. Sydney is just getting out of a loveless marriage. Her best friend, Tori, is also getting out of a bad relationship. Sydney is just fed up with jerks, so she calls up Tori's cheating ex to ream him out- only to find out she dialed the wrong number. She finds herself with a new friend that way, Brian. Brian is getting over a rough spot too. He was involved in an accident that paralyzed a child so he is scraping up money to give to the family, in rather unsavory ways. Meeting Sydney is a breath of fresh air for him. She leans on him to help her get through her rough time. They begin texting, which leads to talking on the phone, and then they're shocked to discover that they live in the same town. They eventually end up meeting, by accident, but it all turns out well. They fall in love pretty quickly. Brian's past causes some bumps for them, but it all works out in the end. 
 I liked Brian and Sydney. They had great chemistry. I really liked the way they met and became friends through text and then phone calls. They had deep feelings for each other before they ever met. Brian was pretty OTT caveman-esque, extra alpha in the way he talked, which did bother me a little bit, but it was okay. I liked that neither of them pushed each other away for silly reasons. I definitely felt their connection. 
 Brian has a big secret that he hides from Sydney, which causes some issues-  He was a porn star when he met Sydney. He was doing porn in order to give money to a child that was paralyzed in a car accident that he caused. He feels great guilt for the accident and the child's family. He secretly sends money to them anonymously and pays for the child's therapies. He knew he could make big money in porn, but he hates it. He hates everything about it, has to take viagra to get it up, and he feels dirty and bad doing it. He was doing it for 3 months when he met Sydney. He immediately stopped doing it when he realizes he likes her. He goes to solo shoots (just himself masturbating) and then quits altogether when he starts talking to her on the phone. He knows he is going to have to tell her eventually, but he tells himself he wants to wait until she's deep in love with him and it is too hard for her to breakup with him then. I didn't love the fact that he was a porn star. It didn't seem like the only way he could have made extra money. I also didn't love that the fact that he seemed to be really good at sex made me wonder if it was because he'd done porn. But I ended up getting over it. He really loved Sydney, worshiped her really. He was regretful of ever doing it and he did everything he could to fix the situation once she found out. It also bothered me less because his personality is not the playboy porn star type. He really hated it and thought of it as a job, a bad one. He got no pleasure out of it and didn't like the girls he performed with. There is also no OW drama, with other women causing trouble between the couple. . 
 But despite that, I did enjoy this book. I liked they way Sydney and Brian loved each other. This is my first book by J. Daniels and I would consider reading more from her in the future.""",2017-01-21 20:07:46,"Four Letter Word (Dirty Deeds, #1)",romance;fiction,J.  Daniels

She has a one night stand with a hot guy who tells her he is named Simon. But her life is turned upside down when the next day, Simon (who turns out to actually be named Six), breaks into her office and kills everyone, taking her hostage. Paisley has information about one of his colleague's (Three) death and Six is holding her captive until he can uncover the truth about why he was killed. Paisley is given a new identity (now she is named Lacey) and dragged around by Six all over the world on a wild goose chase while he tries to figure out what is going on with his colleagues.  It turns out that Six is a CIA operative, a ""cleaner"", and someone is killing the other cleaners, who are all named after numbers.  Along the way, Paisley can't fight her attraction for Six. She knows she shouldn't want him, but she is trying to keep herself alive in any way possible and she is trying to figure out a way to get herself out of the situation. Six tells her he is going to kill her, many times, but it becomes clear that they are developing feelings for each other. Paisley helps Six and they become partners and lovers. But can they stay alive long enough to consider being together? 
 This book is on the dark side, but still had plenty of light moments, mostly due to Paisley's personality. She was funny, strong and determined to make the best out of a bad situation. Six was mysterious, but in those moments he let his guard down, you could see that he did care for Paisley. I enjoyed seeing how their relationship developed from captor/captive to reluctant friends and partners to falling in love. I thought they made a great team and their sexy times were hot!

This book is a spin off of the Wild Side trilogy, which I have not read because I wasn't impressed by the reviews (although I may go back and read it). This is Heath and Lourdes story. Lourdes is the 40 year old recently divorced single mom of two young adult sons. She meets Heath in line at the grocery store and again later at the park. She is immediately attracted to him, but she knows he is younger than her (he is 25). But he pursues her and she can't help herself from having a one night stand. She doesn't think she will ever see him again, but he keeps coming around, unexpectedly, every now and then. Heath is in security, but he is very mysterious and doesn't share much about himself. But he treats her like she deserves and in the time they spend together, they start to fall in love. He even meets her sons. Then he tells her that he can't see her anymore because of his job. She tries to move on and date someone else, Kevin, but her heart isn't really in it. Heath comes back, saying he can't stay away, but he still doesn't know if they can ever be together. And then the drama really starts to hit the fan.  One of Heath's partners from his job, Lisa, comes by and tells her some things about Heath that hurt her, but she isn't sure whether to believe them. Lourdes finds out she is pregnant. Then she is kidnapped by Kevin, who turns out to be an enemy of Heath, and is tortured and cut up. Heath saves her. But the rest of the story is kind of told in a rushed form as an afterthought. They get married, have to live for years in Witness protection, etc. That was all part of Dair and Iris's story in the Wild Side Trilogy, so maybe it was told in more depth in those books.  There was a lot going on during the last 25% of the book. I liked Heath and Lourdes and enjoyed watching their romance develop.

 I was caught off guard at how much I ended up liking this. Some others have called Hadley a whiner- but I'd argue that she was almost the opposite. She sat down way too often, not even raising a resistance to Ernest and his ways. McLain portrayed her in a very relatable way- doing everything she could to hold on to Ernest out of fear of being without him. It doesn't mean that I could completely sympathize, but McLain had me hooked. I picked up this book and read to the end no matter what tragedy was to come (we all know it isn't a happy ending if he has 3 wives after her!). 
 What a horrible way to be ousted out of your own marraige- and so unwillingly. I think McLain's thought process on how Hadley must have been as a personality seemed so realistic-she must have spent a lot of time researching and empathizing. I felt sorry for Hadley, sad often, but I also got so angry that she wouldn't just walk away. Who would ever let another woman just encroach on her territory like that? She seemed so meek so often and yet strong at other times. 
 Not only was the character some one I got swept up with, but the settings and travel was beautifully touched on throughout the novel- very romanticized. Thinking of sadness in these beautiful places was such a juxtaposition- well laid out. I don't think it would have caught my attention as well if they hadn't had all these amazing places, people, and settings mentioned throughout. What an interesting era. 
 It was a train wreck ending, but it was an intriguing read- well thought out- well written and very engrossing. I would recommend it!""",2012-10-26 21:45:56,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

He should read all the books that way I could enjoy them all, even the ones I probably wouldn't like--pretty sure he could make me like 'em. So 5 stars for him and 4 stars for the book itself because, honestly, I don't know how far I'd get or how much I'd enjoy if I'd read these books on my own. 
 The writing is very descriptive, with long passages about early-19th Century culture and society of both Britain and China, and then there are more long passages about politics and intrigue. The previous book was mostly about Napoleon and his continued efforts to take over the rest of Europe; this book expands on that some more, but now there's also China thrown into the mix as both Britain and France fight for the Celestial Emperor's favor. 
 In middle of all of that, you have Temeraire and Laurence and their unbreakable bond. Or, well, what we thought was unbreakable. It was revealed at the end of the first book that Temeraire is a Celestial, the most prized breed of Chinese dragons, and here we learn that Celestials are companions only to Emperors and crown princes. Laurence is most definitely not royalty--he's barely nobility--and so the Chinese disapprove of his bond with Temeraire, and they would very much like their dragon back. The British aren't willing to comply with the request, but they see it as an opportunity to gain an alliance with the Emperor--and to one-up the French--and so they ship Temeraire, Laurence, and the rest of their crew halfway around the world. 
 Peking and Macao of the early-19th Century are a sight to behold for the British envoy and a whole new world full of wonder, for Temeraire especially who's eager to learn of his birth country and discover his roots. The lives of dragons of the East are fascinating to him, and the more he learns about them, the more he's pulled away from Laurence. Laurence, too, is fascinated by the treatment of dragons in Peking, and not just of the Imperials and Celestials, but of the smaller and less important breeds too. He's surprised that they all can live among people so peacefully, and thus comes to understand why Temeraire is so taken in by what he sees. At the end of this book, Temeraire and Laurence are still in China. 
 I'm most impressed by how Naomi Novik inserted dragons into actual history, and with just a little adjustment, she's inserted dragons into the tides of Chinese politics that will forever change the landscape of China for centuries to come. Colonialism is on its way, gradually at first but it's coming nonetheless. I can't help feeling a sense of dread, knowing what's coming in just a few years, but since this story is told from the British perspective, there's a sense of accomplishment and celebration in the writing, especially near the end, when the British envoy have permanently established themselves in China to open up more trading opportunities. 
 It will be interesting to see how much Novik sticks to or deviates from history in later books. I looked ahead and see some hints of Temeraire and Laurence traveling the Silk Road, visiting the Ottoman Empire, and making a stop in Russia. Lots to look forward to, and I can't wait.

2277,14064,4,"""So this is the vampire outbreak that started the zombie outbreaks. 
 * * * spoilers scattered liberally below * * * 
 The book: 
 Matheson adapts a minimal, ""economy of words"" style to capture Neville's loneliness and desperation, and in turn, this limitation of unnecessary words makes the story precise and narrows the scope of the world in which the story is set--post-outbreak Los Angeles. Although I understand the purpose of a limited style, I would have liked to spend some more time with Neville and his past. His story seems unfinished the way it is. His mind is a cluster of grief, guilt, abandonment, hopelessness--all very apocalyptic things--and it's a wonder he's managed to stay alive and functioning for this long. So there's still room in the text to explore the few reasons that keep him going when he himself knows that it's the end of the world. 
 One minor complaint: 
 The events at the end happen too quickly. As the writing rushes toward the climax, it seems as if the story is collapsing in on itself. Perhaps that's what Matheson was going for, and that the collapse of style and structure mimics the circumstances of Neville's end. 
 The movie: 
 (Un)fortunately, I saw the movie before I read the book this time, and it's a whole different creature in its own rights, which screwed up my reading experience because Will Smith as Neville is more charismatic than actual Neville from the book. 
 I like the movie on its own, and I also like the book on its own, and that's a problem because the movie is an incomplete adaptation of the book. Another problem is when the book and the movie are put side-by-side for comparison, I still like them both. 
 The movie has a few things going for it that the book lacks. Will Smith, for one. Another is the scenes with the dog, which are only a few paragraphs in the book. In the movie though, it's a series of interactions and the most intense scenes, to me, because the dog, the only ""human"" contact Neville has, signifies what little joy and hope he has left in the world. But then the dog dies. You don't start feeling utter despair until the moment you realize the dog will die. And then it happens shortly thereafter. There is no joy or hope in the book and, perhaps, that's what the end of humanity should feel like. 
 The audio: 
 Another problem is the audiobook, narrated by Robertson Dean, from Blackstone Audio is also good. There's a sense of self-deprecating humor depicted in the narration that's not present in either the book or the movie. When you catch on to his sense of humor, Neville becomes less of a ""last man on Earth"" caricature and more of a person because you're able to see (hear) him laugh at and berate himself all the while fighting off psychosis. Dean does a great job ""showing"" how palpable Neville's loneliness has become over the months he's survived by withstanding constant attacks from the infected. What stands out the most for me is the way in which Dean slows down the narration at certain moments during a scene and emphasizes them with harsh whispers. 
 The ""I am legend"" paragraph is very well performed, and with that, Neville's story comes to an end as a new ""humanity"" takes shape. 
 I'd never before been interested in a single text enough to seek out all of its adaptations. This book is a first. Next up, The Omega Man.

 Great second edition to the House of Night series..I liked the first book but this book was even better in my opinion. Mostly because your already settled with the characters and new locations so you get into it more.Events in Betrayed continue from about month after the events in Marked (the first book in this series) finished.The book is narrated in first person by sixteen-year old Zoey a fledgling vampyre who has been gifted with unusual powers by the vampyre goddess Nyx. Betrayed sees a more confident Zoey. There is still plenty of confusion in store for Zoey though, as she deals with her feelings for her human ex-boyfriend who she has accidentally Imprinted, while she has her new vampyre fledgling bf Erik who is more of a mate for her. He suits her better. I really love ths characters and their relationships with each other. Zoey's group of friends are amazing and are friends to hope for. Her new bf Erik and her are more introduced and some conflict happens that make her think..Theres a vampyre teacher at the House of night that is flirting with Zoey and making her weak at the knees. 
 There is great dialogue and an amazing plot that even at one point I couldn't stop crying.. it was so sad, but also written so wonderful, I felt like was there with the characters. I'm officially a fan of this series and will countdown the days for each new edition! 
 Synopsis: 
 Summary (from the book jacket) 
 Fledgling vampyre Zoey Redbird has managed to settle in at the House of Night finishing school. She finally feels like she belongs, even gets chosen as the Leader of the Dark Daughters. Best of all, she actually has a boyfriend... or two. Then the unthinkable happens: Human teenagers are being killed, and all the evidence points to the House of Night. 
 While danger stalks the humans from Zoey's old life, she begins to realize that the very powers that make her so unique might also threaten those she loves. Then when she needs her new friends the most, death strikes the House of Night, and Zoey must find the courage to face a betrayal that could break her heart, her soul, and jeopardize the very fabric of her world.""",2009-08-11 09:28:24,"Betrayed (House of Night, #2)",romance;fiction;young-adult;fantasy;paranormal,P.C.

She writes the stories you wish you could have and makes you emotionally attached throughout. I don't think I could choose a favorite from this series but this installment is near the top. 
 It's action packed and a fast paced read. I read it in a few hours and could not put it down. 
 In this installment she puts to rest some ghosts and fights a lot of bad guys. She really goes though a lot of tolls, both emotionally and physically in this book and I felt really attached to her character. 
 There is also a great short story featuring Jenks and Bis in the Anthology Unbound that really gives you that Hollows addiction a kick until the next book. I cannot wait to read BLACK MAGIC SANCTION in 2010, her books never disappoints!

2282,12985143,4,"""This debut was one that I wasn't sure what to expect, but found myself enjoying. Kathleen created a wonderful world with werewolves that we haven't seen before. 
 Mac's life has been completely turned upside since her best friend Amy was murdered by a white werewolf. It was horrible and Amy's been haunting Mac's dreams ever since. 
 Lupine syndrome isn't a secret and is becoming ever present across the country. Trackers, extremists who hunt down those with the disease or full werewolves, come to Hemlock and make life for Mac even more difficult. In her search to find out the truth about Amy's murder, she discovers even more than she bargained for. 
 The tone of Hemlock is pretty dreary in the beginning because of Amy's death and the fact that the town of Hemlock has been haunted by werewolf attacks. This, at least for me, made it even more interesting because I wanted to know what was going on. There are those who side with the wolves and those who want to hunt them down. 
 I always love learning more about the bad guys and their reasons why they do the things that they do. And in Hemlock, Kathleen gives us a little twist on who the bad guys are. The Trackers definitely gave me the creeps and I could understand why Mac didn't like them either. But there's so much more going on than you first realize. 
 Werewolves are pretty popular creatures to use, and I found myself getting tired of them, but I really enjoyed Kathleen's take on them. In the world of Hemlock werewolves are viewed in a completely different light than how we've seen them portrayed lately. For one they are common knowledge, and for another they aren't seen as good guys. 
 Hemlock was a fun, interesting read and I know that I can't wait to read book two to find out just what else is in store for Mac and her friends.""",2011-06-30 23:30:33,"Hemlock (Hemlock, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Kathleen Peacock

2285,13449677,3,"""I'm coming off finishing The Collector with some mixed emotions. 
 On one hand, I definitely get why people love Dante. He's got a lot of charisma and his narration is hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud at several things he said. I also really liked his progression as a character, how he really comes to see the value in goodness. He's lived a certain way for a long time and that's a hard kind of habit to break, and that struggle is good to see. It's not an easy road. Even so, he's a character I'd only like in short doses; his certain brand of confidence is one that could get annoying very quickly. 
 Aside from Dante, I pretty much liked everyone else a whole lot. Charlie is just so endearing in everything she does that I couldn't help but like her. If Annabelle were real I probably would have high-fived her six or seven times, and Blue was so earnest yet tough that it broke my heart. Also, can I please get some background on Max and Valery? Maybe even an entire book. Yes. 
 But, on the other hand, there was nothing in this story that really captured me, making me want to live in the world. I can't think of any ""wow' moments or times I found myself thinking just how much I was loving the book. It's not that it was a bad book in any way, but I just couldn't find an emotional connection. 
 Even so, The Collector is a laugh-out-loud hilarious paranormal romance that is full of memorable characters, one that kept me reading until after 3 a.m. And for those great characters, I will happily continue the series.

2286,12792988,5,"""4.5 out of 5 stars 
 I can't believe it took me so long to read this book!!! I've just put it off and put it off for other things, but I am so glad I finally took the time. Fantastic. I did find the relationship between James and Tess developed a teensy bit quickly for my taste, but I also liked the restraint in the beginning and middle of the relationship. It was interesting to see. 
 I think the most striking part of Chosen Ones for me was Tess. I don't know what I expected, but she certainly was nothing like what I anticipated. Tess starts off as cold and distant from those around her, and even, in a way, from the reader. She knows getting attached to anyone just leads to being hurt. At the start of the book, her sister--one of the few she's let through her shell--has just died. The reader gets to see Tess' transformation as she learns how love can change you. She never understood the things her sister did when it came to the man she married, Robert. But when she comes to know James, she begins to see. I loved Tess for how closed off she was. It was a rational way to cope, and I loved seeing her grow. 
 The other thing I loved about Tess was her self-preservation. For the most part, she's always looking out for herself. That's just not a common thing to see in dystopians. The heroine is generally only thinking of others in her actions, but I've never felt that to be especially accurate. It's just not human nature to sacrifice yourself for people you don't know. There are exceptions to that, obviously, but I liked seeing someone who is true to herself and true to life. 
 Chosen Ones has a plot that keeps you on your toes. You've just got your bearings on the world, and it just takes off. It makes for a fast and really entertaining read. This is definitely a dystopian a step above the rest. I can't wait to get into the second book, Naturals, and see where the journey takes Tess and James next!

2287,8683812,3,"""Real and painful. Solid characters. Historical exploration with a romance, but still relevant to any lover of Hemingway. This one was almost four stars for me. 
 I tended to doubt some of the leeway she took with historical details. But generally I think McLain did a good job creating their voices. It was a beautiful way of stepping into the lives of Hemingway and Hadley. I liked how the author used the names of Hemingway's works and their friends and put them in context. But sometimes the cast of secondary characters was just distracting and only occasionally relevant. The love scenes were pretty tastefully done. 
 But somehow parts of this were still stale. Her writing is fast and easy, which makes this an easy book to get through, and McLain tries hard to be poignant... But those little quotables didn't always feel natural.

2288,15797848,3,"""I did NOT want to read this book once it came out. Before that, I was so stoked but once the reviews started pouring in..... well, we've seen the reviews. I love Stephanie Perkins so much so when I saw that people weren't really enjoying this I was so disappointed. 
 But then I read it, and I wasn't disappointed. 
 For an author who primarily writes contemporary, light-hearted, YA romance, this wasn't THAT bad. It's not like she's Stephen King and writes this kinda thing.... then I'd be more disappointed. 
 But it wasn't AWFUL like I thought it was going to be. 
 You do get a bit of what Stephanie typically writes sprinkled throughout this story - not that I'm complaining, I loved Ollie and Makani - but I do so the Scream element that the tagline for the book hinted at. I think one of the major issues I had was that the ending didn't feel like much of an ending, and seeing as I don't see this being turned into a series (and if it does.... no), I don't think it'll ever feel like I was given a proper conclusion to the end of this. I had a few unanswered questions by the end and when I was done I literally flipped back to make sure I didn't miss a page..... so, not good in that regard. 
 I did genuinely feel scared though. The furniture being moved was terrifying and the very first chapter kinda set the mood on how creepy it'd get. I think one of the worst feelings is knowing someone has been in or is currently in your house when they shouldn't be. It's unnerving and so violating..... so it put my on edge in my own house haha.

 Ok, so let me set the scene: it's past midnight and I'm a little bleary-eyed, having just finished Hemlock and I'm not even the least bit sleepy because it was awesome and thrilling and I just want to get all of it out while I'm still feeling the rush! 
 Seriously, I was thinking werewolves and I didn't mesh well. But Hemlock has changed all of this. It wasn't the werewolves on themselves, it was just the novels that weren't working for me, because as you can tell from my exlamation above, this one obviously did work for me. Rather well actually. And you know what I think caused this? Kathleen Peacock didn't take the GRRR out of the werewolves and it is SUCH a pet peeve of mine when this happens to paranormal beings! I mean, if werewolves were just slightly overgrown dogs, more like pets actually, they wouldn't be werewolves right? The essential part is that they SHOULD be dangerous. Because they have big claws and teeth and huh, who was that that tried to kill Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother? (I know, not a werewolf, but that's beside the point) (Point being wolves are dangerous, not domesticated) So yay for lethal wolves instead of puppies! 
 I loved, loved, loved the storytelling! From the moment I started I was sucked in and was just ignoring everything around me so I could luxuriate in the world and the words and the characters and just everything! Although a plea to anyone reading this: please don't ever use whisper-beg in well, basically anything. I KNOW it's something that you can do at the same time, but for some reason it makes my skin crawl. 
 But besides that one thing I loved the writing :) 
 And Mac, gosh, I really adore that girl! She hasn't had it easy and I could understand how her personality formed itself after that. I connected with her and was there with her second guessing everything and everyone because really, THE TWISTS JUST KEPT ON COMING! I mean, whenever I felt safe in my opinion of someone, everything got turned upside down again and I was left with my mouth hanging slightly open, going 'what??'. And I loved it! Though I did think the girl should at one point have stopped insisting she could take care of herself, because she'd been near death about 10 times in 3 days. I loved that her love interest knew her so well and that she did eventually trust herself and himself enough to admit her feeling for him. Good romance :) 
 Also, while sometimes I find that dream sequences don't work for me, in this case they really did! They were interesting and definitely added to the anticipation and it didn't feel contrived at all. I'm not sure how I feel about the love triangle though. It's not something that for me ruined anything about the story. Yet. I'm really hoping it will just sort of go away and not be a major thing in the sequel. Because I am only rooting for one boy and his name is: 
 ***SPOILER, LIGHT UP TO READ*** 
 KYLE. Seriously, that boy! Broke my heart when he just left and I had definitely not seen it coming... Can someone just please tell him being honorable isn't all it's cracked up to be?? Please?  
 ***END OF SPOILER*** 
 Oh, and the cover: it is le pretty! 
 So, in short: exciting, enticing debut novel with a heroine who's easy to relate to, a boy that made me swoon, good romance and werewolves that have maintained their GRRR! 
 I for one cannot wait for the sequel!

2302,28660,2,"""I'm giving up on this one on page 307 of about 600. It's just not grabbing me. Here are my problems with it: 
 1. I don't understand the basis for the system of magic being used, because it's never really explained. There are long, LONG passages where you read about WHAT the mages are doing, but have no idea HOW or WHY it is supposed to work. I have no idea if the efforts being made are likely to work or not, and so the descriptions fall pretty flat as far as building dramatic tension goes. I see no basis for the conclusions characters are drawing about the magical nature of the threats they are facing, so I'm not really drawn into wondering or considering for myself whether they are correct or not. As a result, I feel very passive as a reader, not engaged intellectually. 
 2. The characters seem pretty cardboard. One character is Dramatic and Complicated, and you know this because...you are repeatedly told that he is Dramatic and Complicated. But I don't feel that I've actually seen enough from the character to draw this conclusion on my own. It's a case of being told, not shown. Likewise, the book keeps trying to build sympathy for another character by repeatedly bringing up the fiancee he left behind and will Never See Again. Which might be more effective if we had ever MET this fiancee back when he was in her same general geographic location (she was never mentioned until she was Left Behind). Or if she had a NAME. Or a SINGLE, IDENTIFIABLE PERSONALITY TRAIT. Or if there was A MEMORY connected to her. As it is, this anonymous person is just mentioned every now and then in an attempt to create some kind of sympathy for her alleged lover, but again, it falls flat, because there's nothing there to make us actually care about this person and no reason to feel that her lover actually cares about her, other than the fact that we are repeatedly told that he misses her. Whoever she may be. 
 3. The language is overly flowery and doesn't flow naturally. I have a great love for authors like Guy Gavriel Kay and Jacqueline Carey, who can write in beautiful, flowing, formal language and make it seem natural in the context of their novels, but that is a rare talent, in my experience. This attempt feels more like the author sat down with a thesaurus and referred to it for every other word in the story. It's not working for me. Also, the passive voice is used a LOT, enough that it's annoying me and pulling me out of the story. 
 All in all, I'm half way through and I don't care if any of the characters make it to the end of the book, let alone the end of the series 10 and a half books from now, so I'm throwing in the towel.""",2010-06-11 07:13:52,"The Curse of the Mistwraith (Wars of Light and Shadow, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction,Janny Wurts
2303,3475268,3,"""I generally like this series, but this book's ratio of ass-kicking to emotional self-indulgence was heavily weighted towards the emotional self-indulgence. I say ""self-indulgence"" because most of the book seemed to revolve around Rachel feeling sorry for herself and whining about how aloooooone she was because nobody understaaaaands her. The personalities of some other characters seemed to be entirely altered just to advance this agenda. That shift in how certain characters behaved, along with the fact that the plot of this book depends heavily on events that occurred in two separate short stories in two separate short story collections, plus the sudden introduction of a couple heretofore unheard-of facets of witch culture in The Hollows, made this book seem really disjointed and unconnected to the rest of the series. 
 I read both of the short stories that form the basis for this book's plot, but I can't say I'm wild about an author suddenly going out and making previously unconnected books part of the ""canon"" of the series, so that people who were not inclined to go and check out the short stories (or were not aware of them) would find themselves totally lost all of a sudden, even if they had read the whole series in order. Most of the short stories I have read by other series authors are careful to stick to plots that, while they may illuminate a bit more about a certain character, do not impinge on the over-arching story of the series. They take place on the margins of the main story; they don't directly INFLUENCE the main story. At most, you might get a throw-away line in a main book that references the events of a short story, but it's never crucial to the plot. So this move by Kim Harrison to suddenly make her previous short stories part of the main plot of the series as a whole really rubs me the wrong way. It strikes me as more of an attempt to force everyone to go out and buy copies of these two short story collections (which contain stories by other authors Harrison's readers may or may not care about) than an organic development of the series. At best, it is an exceedingly clumsy way to advance the story, and this was a pretty clumsy book. (Not only in terms of plotting, but even to the level of basic editing mistakes, like a person being described as having ""thin fingers"" on one page and ""thick fingers"" two pages later.) I only hope the next one is better, now that Harrison has shoe-horned all these new elements into the story and at least gotten that out of the way.""",2009-02-24 19:11:17,"White Witch, Black Curse (The Hollows, #7)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;history;historical fiction;biography,Kim Harrison

 This maze of a plot was simply too long. The reader is tipped off early that the author has researched the place thoroughly (south France in the late Middle Ages) and is not going to let the reader go without hearing it all. The pace at the beginning is glacial; soooo much detail about the flowers in the meadow and the clothes and the castle and the soldiers and the dead body floating in the stream...oy. Toooooo sloooooooow. We learn a lot of information about the Cathars, a heretical sect, and we get a new twist on the legend of the Holy Grail. It's clear this exhaustive detail is a deliberate authorial choice, not a mistake, and perhaps there are readers who want that sort of thing (fantasy readers are notoriously tolerant of discursiveness) but as the book goes on and the editing quality declines, the choice becomes less and less justifiable. 
 The pace picks up whenever the scene shifts to the present day. Basically we've got a murder mystery to solve, and a woman (Alice) who is psychically linked to another woman (Alais) from the Middle Ages who may have something to do with a pair of skeletons found in a cave in a modern archaeological dig. This is, in fact, the biggest flaw of the book: the modern sections kept me relatively interested, with their mystery and assassins and creepy cultists and intrigue, while the tooooooo loooooong historical sections bored me. 
 At 16 CDs in the audio version, this novel is tooooooo sloooooow and toooooo looooong by at least a third. (The narrator, Donada Peters, was an excellent choice.) The ending has some good points, including a touch of tragic romance, but the big surprise was heavily signaled from a distance and any attentive reader would have figured it out long before.

 She had me nervous about that for a while, though. And when Evie's ""inescapable"" was introduced, I was seriously tempted to throw in the towel.

2310,8683812,4,"""I've read one book by Hemingway, and I hated it, but before I write off an author completely I like to read two books by them. The Paris Wife has re-motivated me to give Hemingway another go and I got A Moveable Feast and in the future (as in later this summer) I hope to read The Sun Also Rises . Even though I hated my first encounter with Hemingway I couldn't seem to escape him. He was in Midnight in Paris. I watched Hemingway & Gellhorn because the summary sounded interesting (and it was a good movie). Then in Target one day this book title caught my eye. I debated buying this book for months, every time I went to Target. I kept making excuses about not having the time or money to read it. Then finally I bought it. Not at Target. At the airport. And I devoured it on my flight home to Chicago. 
 The author does an exquisite job transporting her reader to every place she describes whether its Chicago, Paris, the Spanish bullfights. All described in vivid detail as were all the characters. None of them were able to fade into obscurity in this tale, through Hadley we observe many members of the Lost Generation and learn about their little secrets and what makes them tick. I also did not expect this story to be so romantic but it is, at its heart, a love story. Hadley's love for Hemingway was absolutely maddening at times, especially during one particular scene involving Pauline and vacation and I won't say I understood how she was still able to love him but I didn't see her as weak or as a victim. Instead Hadley emerges from the story as strong, stronger than the obsessed-with-machoism-Hemingway and still capable of getting a happy ending. She does not bemoan her Paris experiences, she appreciates Hemingway for what he taught her and the experiences they went through together. She is better able to appreciate certain things because of him. I am curious if Hemingway and Hadley's descendants approve of this novel, I certainly think they should since both Hadley and Hemingway are portrayed as genuine, flawed and interesting people. 
 A tale that is devoured as easily as a croissant and chocolate and that resists the urge to randomly name-drop but instead takes the time to develop all characters who cross Hadley's path.""",2013-05-17 18:32:42,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

 I was torn between 3 and 4 stars...Although I felt I liked this book and I couldn't put it down, sometimes it felt that the plot was moving too slow. I have no problem with slow books but in this case sometimes it felt it was too slow for no reason...However, despite that fact, I enjoyed the book, something which is really contradictory. Also, I thought I would dislike the character, who is a Marty Stu, but despite the occasional sigh ""don't tell me he has that talent as well!"" he didn't come out as annoying, which is a feat. I would like some of the other characters to be fleshed out more and have more depth, but I guess as this is a biography told in the voice of Kvothe it revolves around him, and the other characters are always seen in relation to him. However, they could have been a little deeper. As for Denna, I didn't really hate her, as I've seen many people do, but I didn't really like her as well. She feels kind of indifferent, plus I would have liked her more if she could figure some other way to make a living. I liked Auri more, as she is independent and has been able to survive on her own, without Kvothe having to save her. Of course she has some mental issues, but that was the only female character I liked in the book. The others seemed to be there to be seen as maidens in distress or to have an erotic function.

 *I received a digital copy of this book from YA Bound Book Tours in exchange for an honest review.* 
 I absolutely fell in love with this book. It had all the elements that I love in a contemporary new-adult novel. Plus I have a thing for forbidden romance and it was sort of that which greatly increased the thrill of the read and made it such a great book. 
 The story revolves around a girl named Cameron who along with her friends decide to have a wild night before they start their new jobs. They had made a list of what they should do, Cameron's friends decide to add one more to their list at the last moment which states that they have to hook up with some random stranger or atleast kiss them. At first Cameron is reluctant but she finally agrees. Then she meets the gorgeous Aidan Truitt in the bar and one thing leads to another and they end up spending the night together. After she sobers up in the morning, she practically kicks him out of her house, then she rushes to her new job where she finds Aidan is present and also learns that he is her boss's boss and she has to constantly work with him. The attraction between them becomes undeniable and they forced to keep thei relationship secret because of the company's no fraternity policy, but secrets have a way of getting out. 
 The plot was intersting and great. Cameron and Aidan received the shock of their lives when they came face to face in the next morning. They tried to stay away from each, keep their relationship strictly professional but the temptation was too great and they finally gave in to their desires. Byt they had to keep it a secret. It was a great roller coaster ride. When the truth came out about their relationship I absolutely loved how everything was handled. 
 I loved the characters. Cameron was a relatable character. She was confident, smart, knew what she wanted. And Aidan was simply yummy! I mean gorgeously handsome. And definitely swoon worthy. Their chemistry and the pull they felt towards each other was undeniable. It was an awsome moment when they finally decided to break the rules but they still had to overcome a few boundaries before they were finally together. But they agreed upon a few rules, one of them was never to fall in love, but they couldn't maintain that rule either as they fell hard for each other but they took their time to accept it and admit it to each other. But how they handled things at the end melted my heart, it was just sooo sweet. 
 I also loved the family aspect of this book. Aidan didn't have a mother and his father was an asshole, that's why Cameron took him to her family to celebrate the holidays and he greatly enjoyed there. Her family was so warm and great and they accepted him as a part of their own with open arms. Cameron's friends are also worth mentioning because they were literally awsome, specially Lauren. She was always there for her, whenever she needed her. It was such a beautiful relationship. 
 The writing was smooth and gorgeous. I was hooked from the very first page and I kept on reading even after 3 am. It was just so addicting. I easily finished the book in one sitting. I loved every aspect of this book. 
 Overall, the plot was interesting and greatly executed, the characters were awsome, the romance was sizzling hot and the writing was gorgeous. This book is definitely one of new favourites and I can see myself rereading this book a thousand times more in the future. 
 Recommend it?

 He ran his mother ragged. He set fire to a house. He committed petty crime. But, when you hear him tell his own story, you can't help but root for him. 
 The book does exactly what is written on the tin. It's a book about his childhood. If you're looking for a memoir about his career or his stint on the The Daily Show, you're gonna be disappointed. It's also clearly written for a non-South African audience; Noah does a great job at explaining the insidiousness of apartheid and systematic racism. 
 For the most part, this book is a pretty light-hearted collection of humorous anecdotes about school, friendship, teenage romances, parties and drinking.

 2. The killer: You find out who it is halfway through the book. So while there are still moments of suspense when the killer strikes again and again (and again), you're not left with the same baffling question of WHO could be doing this? that you should have had. (And honestly, the build-up of the character of the killer was insufficient to then make you care once you find out.) I wish Perkins had decided whether she wanted to write a psychological (and extremely bloody, by the way) book about a serial killer OR a horror book. The two don't necessarily equate, and didn't here. 
 3. The motive: Insufficient. Weird. Anticlimactic. All words that you could also say about the ending. 
  
 4. All the romance: This one could be either a plus or a minus, depending upon your attitude toward lots of interludes for crushing and sex. It was well written, fairly tasteful, and sometimes pretty funny, so it's all according to your tolerance level. 
 The absolute best part of the whole book was a small element, but it was the only one that provoked real dread and gave me the creepies up my spine that I'm looking for from a horror book: The subtle (and sometimes not subtle) rearrangement of the victims' belongings, making them wonder if they're crazy, if someone in their household is losing it, or if friends are pranking them. That was genuinely creepy, went with the title of the book, and set me up to expect more. But I have to say that that title made me expect something along the lines of the old chestnut where the babysitter gets the call from the cops, who tell her the killer is calling her from inside the house. Nobody ever does that here, so the phrasing of it ""There's someone inside your house"" as if someone is telling you that? Never happens. That disappointed me.  Other than that effective psychological trick, though...not so much.""",2017-01-22 08:12:46,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins

 J. Daniels proves once again why she's one of my favorite authors! 
 Love was a risk. It was wild and unpredictable. You could either hold on for the ride, not knowing how it would end, or you could let go and never know the amazing you could've had. 
 After Sydney gets dumped by her husband, she flees to Dogwood Beach to stay with her best friend. When Sydney stays with Tori, she finds out that the guy Tori had been seeing broke her heart. Sydney is out looking for blood after all that anger she had for her husband. And the perfect excuse to let out all that frustration comes in the form of dialing the man Tori was dating to give him a piece of her mind. After Sydney rambles on and on turns out she dialed the wrong number and the guy on the line is actually amused by Sydney. They start texting, then calling each other, and ultimately confiding in one another. 
 Best two and a half weeks of my life came from a girl who was never meant to give me anything. And she was giving me everything. 
 I was so impressed by this novel that J. Daniels crafted of two strangers meeting accidentally through a phone call! I was especially drawn to Brian Savage and the predicament he was in. He looks forward to every text and phone call with Sydney and he wants nothing more than to be with her, but it's not that easy. He has a job that won't exactly make it easy to be with Sydney. I wasn't expecting the job he had and the way. It would break my heart when he was vulnerable and after learning why it brought me to tears. 
 ""You're the best mistake I've ever made."" 
 Sydney was such a firecracker and I loved that about her! There's a reason Brian calls her Wild. The nickname fits her to a T. And when she gets together with Tori, it's even more! Sydney and Tori felt authentic and their friendship was unbelievably tight. I loved how these two were always there for one another. If one felt like doing something crazy and, let's be honest, not normal, the other one would encourage and do the same thing. I mean, there's a car scene that totally explains this (and I was singing ""Bust Your Windows"" while reading this). 
 Overall, Four Letter Word surprised me in such a good way. It was everything I didn't know I wanted and more! The wit and humor had me laughing, the romance had me swooning and melting inside, the friendships were some of the best I've read in a while. J. Daniels delivered a great story and I can't wait for the rest of the series! 
 I received a finished copy from the author for free in exchange for an honest review.

 This book, like The Piano Teacher, grows on you. Like Loving Frank, it is fiction based on history. Specific history about celebrity's lives. The first chapter or two are not stellar, but if you keep reading you get sucked deeper into the world of Hadley (Ernest Hemingway's first wife). Even if you know nothing about Hemingway, this is still a fascinating book because of the rich characters and descriptive writing. 
 Hadley is much older than Ernest, but he is a lot more experienced. She lead a very sheltered life and he served in the war. She is a homebody who enjoys being married and caring for children, and he is an adrenaline junkie, always seeking his next thrill. They both drink a lot, but so does everyone in the novel. Other artists besides Hemingway are main characters: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound etc. This is Jazz Age Paris. It is obvious Ernest and Hadley love each other, and in many ways are perfect for each other. But they have different life goals, I believe. This leads to the end result of Ernest having an affair with Hadley's best friend. She is betrayed by both her true love and a woman she really liked. It is very sad. Most disturbing to me is that she was very close friends with the woman, and for a while Ernest proposes that they all live together, as if he has two wives, and during this very brief and upsetting period the mistress acts like she is still Hadley's best friend, and cares for her deeply, even though she has been secretly having sex with her husband for months and months and now wants him to divorce Hadley and marry her. Hadley fights for her marriage, but soon realizes it is a lost cause, and grants him divorce. I think he was a fool to give her up: she truly loved him and understood him. Hadley is very kind and forgiving, not only to her husband, but to everyone she knows. Ernest is very judgmental and suspicious. He loses a lot of friends over the course of the book, and the fault is his own. He is harsh and unforgiving. But he loves Hadley very much and is always kind to her and tries hard to see things from her point of view.""",2013-11-18 00:00:34,The Paris Wife,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;romance;non-fiction,Paula McLain

 Overall, I enjoyed it but there times where I found myself a bit bored. The story has some fantastic sequences of intense and imaginative action which makes the reader wonder how the heck our protagonists will ever get out of the situation they find themselves in, and these are an absolute delight to witness. However, for me, one of the two main characters (Caswell) never really connected, which more or less left me with an ambivalent relationship with half the story. This may very well be by design considering the situation the character finds himself, but still - that's one part that left me cold. 
 When the wider scope of the story gets revealed, it's quite well done, but I can't help but think there was something MISSING from the whole thing. It's as if the resolution was missing some punch or impact. 
 However, with a unique book like this, I'm often left asking myself the question: if there were another book in this setting with these characters, would I read it? In this case, I would answer a definite ""yes!"" That tells me there's still something interesting and unique to this story, and I'm glad I read it.""",2016-02-24 14:17:53,Zero World,fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;fantasy;paranormal,Jason M. Hough

 Savannah (Savvy) Grady had a passion for dancing. But a wrong choice led her to desperation for a job and a reunion with someone from her past brought up a different kind of desperation. 
 Killian (Kite) Kane grew up as an angry teenager. He had the need to upheld justice and protected others, including a girl he cared about. Years later he became a famous rock star and the need to protect and claim came back with her return. 
 Kite really intrigued me in the last book, so I'm very happy when he finally get his own story. It was different from what I expected, but still enjoyable. 
 He was worth the risk. The hidden. The complicated. The man who had demons behind the captivating green eyes, but within the depths also lived a man who cared. Who protected. Who made my heart skip a beat and my breath stop. 
 Kite had a broken past. What he endured as a kid was bad and he was still haunted by it. He was detached to protect himself from being hurt. But deep down he cared more than he showed. 
 I felt like that rabbit quivering in the hole as the wolf approached. The difference was, there was a part of me that wanted to get caught. 
 Savvy was having hard time with her life. Even after being screwed, she always find goodness with others. As intimidating as Kite was, I like how she wasn't afraid to stand up against him. 
 I like their story - how they reconnected and made it work. I also like their background. However I was expecting something more. Previous books in the series had more darkness and some suspense elements so that's what I was anticipating. This book was more mellow. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just personally, I'd like to see more complications in the story. 
 There's a new character in this book that I love. Trevor brought something extra to the story and I just love how he connected with the main characters effortlessly.

 Brecks (B) Kennedy was an addict. From the first taste she had, she was hooked on the exquisite taste of Jamie Shaw. She grasped on to it for a long time because the lingering taste was worth it - not counting the pain and heartbreaks that came with it. 
 I wasn't sure what this book is about but I saw reviews mentioning angst, and that's what pulled me in. I thought it's about addiction and it is but not the kind I thought - which is better. 
 I knew what he wanted, what he needed in life -- but I also knew I couldn't be that for him. Not yet, at least. 
 B started as someone I like. But very quickly my feelings for her shifted. Her actions were frustrating and there were a lot of time I wanted to bitch slap her face haha! 
 ""So if I can't have you at your worst, and I can't have you at your best, then when do I get you, B? When does the timing line up for you to stop fighting what we have between us and just let me in?"" 
 My love for Jamie never wavered. He was charming and patient. He was not without fault but I forgave him for his situation. His confidence was attractive but his vulnerability was what melted my heart. 
 ""Isn't okay. We're toxic, Jamie. All we do is hurt each other, hurt the ones who love us, hurt ourselves."" 
 As mentioned this book was full of angst. It's ever present, constantly simmering and sometimes boiled over here and there. I had chest pain in the two days I read it but since I'm an emotional pain whore, it was a beautiful torture lol! 
 A Love Letter To Whisky is a journey of two people growing up and owning up to their heart's desires. It would appeal to readers who like going through emotions.

2359,186074,5,"""A couple of days ago, I wrote a review in which I expressed my hatred for flashbacks and books that have a lot of them or are told in that form. I also said that there was one exception to that loathing. I was talking about this book. This is the exception. 
 This is a story about Kvothe, and how he becomes the ""most notorious wizard his world has ever seen"". And that's all you need to know. When I started reading the book, I didn't even know this much. Only that I'd heard it had a magic school of some sort and that a lot of people loved it. I think knowing as little as possible is the best way to approach this novel. 
 And this is an awesome novel. Going into it, I expected it to be boring, for some reason. It was most definitely not. It's not extremely fast paced, but it is very engrossing. Which is due to many reasons. 
 For one: the writing. Patrick Rothfuss has written this novel very beautifully. The writing has a poetic quality to it, but one that flows so well that you never have to pause to understand some metaphor that's used. There's no pretentiousness or awkwardness, no hiccups. The prose made me very happy. 
 The setting is also great. How we move to different places throughout the novel and immerse in those places and people. We got urban settings and rural settings, we got practical people and superstitious ones. We got poor, rich, rigid, religious, educated, illiterate, kind, vengeful and so many more. And it was all done really well. Brilliant world building based around people. 
 Talking of people... The characters. Won't go into detail about those or this review might get pretty long. Just gonna say that I love Kvothe. One of my favourite protagonists ever. 
 The only ""negative"" I have isn't exactly a negative. There was just a scene in which I was promised a lot of hurt (I didn't want the hurt but I expected it) but there wasn't much. It was slightly disappointing (but also a relief). I have a feeling the next book will remedy that. 
 Overall just... read the book. I think I've written enough to convince you. If I haven't, I'll leave you with this small excerpt that I fell in love with. 
 ""Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts. There are seven words that will make a person love you. There are ten words that will break a strong man's will. But a word is nothing but a painting of a fire.

 The first time I heard of Trevor Noah was on Fallon. He was just about to take over The Daily Show from Jon Stewart and I had no idea who either of them were or what TDS was, but I thought he was funny and also hella cute. So then yt recommended some videos of his stand-up performances and I was sold. I think I saw the video about Zimbabwe's escalator at least five times. By the time Born a Crime came out, I was a proper fangirl and I wouldn't shut up about it. In the end, my friends surprised me and bought it for my birthday. Many squealing and screaming ensued. 
 I thought this book would mention his career and how it all started, but true to its title, it's about his childhood and events that marked his life. And his mother, who is a force of nature. Wow, that woman! You know all that empowering, motivational, inspirational quotes you see on Pinterest and Instagram? That's his mom. All these quotes, mixed into one strong, badass human being. Somebody mentioned here (or maybe not here, maybe somewhere else) that this book is an ode to his mother and I can definitely see that too. 
 I was going to reflect on how the last few pages were really disturbing, but I realized that this book has a lot of disturbing shit in it. But it was an eye-opening experience for me. For example, I knew of apartheid, I knew of Nelson Mandela, we briefly touched it in history and maybe literature classes. I knew what it represented, but I never actually like really thought about it, what it means and how ridiculous the concept is. I was baffled. I mean, on GR I encountered a shit ton of the most ridiculous dystopian YA novels out there and I instantly thought to myself apartheid beats them all by a long shot. And I know it sounds silly, comparing apartheid to made up worlds in books, but they were my only frame of reference. The only thing I could compare it to that I've witnessed. 
 One of my favorite stories inside is about his friend Hitler and what happened when they went on that dance competition. That story is very much wtf mixed in with some laughs, and again realization. Once you read the book, you'll see what I'm talking about. 
 Reading Born a Crime was an experience for me. As it is, I'm book hungover for the second day in a row now, I won't shut up about it to my friends, and every now and then, my mind wanders on its own to a bit of the story that stuck with me and I catch myself just thinking again about what I've read. I know it's only January, but I think this will be my favorite book of 2017.""",2016-11-27 23:18:25,Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah

We have a latina heroine and an ex marine dragon shifter who was her deceased brother's best friend. We have a lot of the plot spent on the physical relationship and not as much spent on the emotional and cultural aspects of the book. In this way, its a fun frothy paranormal erotic read. 
 However, I wish this book had a little more length to it so it could have balenced out the world building, erotica, romance, and character development aspects. It might have been very captivating then and rereadable instead of a popcorn read. 
 As it stands, this book was a nice quick read and I look forward to the rest of the series.

 His tattoos are actually especially interesting and I love how the cover tries to follow the description in the book. Luke has some actions that I think are out of character but mostly except of a darker or riskier tinge to his sexual pleasure (light BDSM and some exhibitionism), he is and dresses like slightly edgy stud of his generation. 
 The heroine is a bit less likeable than Luke but I am not sure why. She is a great friend and her family is a hoot. I think I find her a little shallow (both of them really). The distinct personality traits they both have seem more like clothes they wear than embedded parts of themselves so sometimes the motivation for certain actions seems over the top.

 Review 
 When I want a book that won't put me through the emotional ringer, make me wanna pull my hair out or drown myself in tears, I look no further than Alexa Riley. These authors delivering a quick, easy and over the top type romance that hits every single sweet spot imaginable and delivering exactly what I need. 
 Blackmailing the Virgin is no exception. 
 An alpha male that knows exactly what it is he wants (the heroine), a young lady that is taken by said alpha yet can't for the life of her understand why (often times a virgin) and an insta-love connection that never ever wavers. Add just the right dash of emotional pulling drama (and I do mean a dash) and it seems like the perfect setup for a romance. Especially here. 
 This book reads a lot like romances of old and I think that's why I enjoyed it so much. Sure, it was short, but not so short that I felt slighted in any way. I could get behind the characters, even swoon over them and just how damn determined Calder is to have her forever. 
 Damn near melting when the ""I love you"" comes into play, especially when it happens naturally. 
 You'll enjoy this story if you've enjoyed anything from these authors in the past, like your devoted alpha's or just like a short read with a happily ever after. I know I sure did. 
 My thanks to the authors and all others involved in letting me read an ARC of this before official release. Can't wait to see what you've got for us next.""",2016-05-07 08:47:41,"Blackmailing the Virgin (Alexa Riley Promises, #2)",romance,Alexa Riley

As such, I learned more about Apartheid than I ever have before. I wasn't very familiar with Trevor Noah before reading this book, so maybe that's part of the reason I had trouble connecting with it. Certain parts of the book were hard to read; that is, there was some intense stuff going on in Noah's life. And I almost thought about putting the book down when I came to the part about the cats.

I found the description here at Goodreads and was intrigued, so I went out and bought it. 
 I am not sure where to even start. I was definitely impressed with the quality of writing. I was most definitely impressed with the world that Patrick created. 
 It was a fantasy novel, that didn't feel like fantasy. The characters were so well realized, the magic so well rooted and described, the action was terrific, the sorrow was real. The pace was excellent. 
 You feel everything Kvothe feels, see everything he sees, are there right along with him on his many journeys, triumphs, challenges and horrors. 
 You learn along side him, weep along with him and cheer with the Eloidin Crowd for him.

 Strangers on a Train is one of those novels that I constantly kept hearing about. I knew it was an older novel and that it is considered a classic thriller, but that was about the extent of my knowledge. It's no secret that I love a good psychological thriller, but I've only read recent books from within this genre so I decided to broaden my range. 
 Strangers on a Train tells the story of Charles Anthony Bruno and Guy Haines, two men that meet while they are on the same train. As the men start to get to know one another, and more alcoholic beverages are consumed, secrets start to come out. Guy reveals that he is angry with his ex-wife for sleeping with another man and becoming pregnant with his child. Bruno admits he hates his father immensely. That's when Bruno comes up with an idea...what if he murdered Guy's ex-wife and what if Guy were to murder Bruno's father? Of course, Bruno was just joking around...wasn't he? 
 I enjoyed that the story alternated between both Guy & Bruno's perspectives. It provided a pretty interesting and dynamic insight into how both men reacted differently to the same scenarios. Both men could not be more different from one another. On one hand, we have Guy, an architect who is pretty well-off thanks to his own professional success. He is set to be married again soon and his life seems well put together. Then we have Bruno, a younger man who comes from a rich family due to his father's profession. He is whiny, and quite frankly, really annoying and almost conceited. He is spoiled and becomes upset when things don't go his way. The narrator within this audiobook did a good job of changing his performance based on which character's perspective he was reading from. While he was reading as Bruno, he would get extremely whiny and would yell a lot which was slightly unpleasant when listening through headphones. 
 I was quite entertained while listening to this story and I was really excited to see how each character reacted to their decisions as the story continued. I really enjoyed listening to Strangers on a Train until about the last half hour or so. Things really slowed down and the last little chunk of the story almost felt unneeded. There was also a moment that felt very sudden and that wasn't explained with a lot of detail. It kind of happened and that was that. Although the ending died down a little for me personally, I did like the last 5 minutes or so of the story...although it did leave me wanting a little more. 
 Although Strangers on a Train was published back in 1950, it felt really modern and that it could still be relevant to psychological thriller fans today. I barely even realized that there was no mention of cellphones or the internet, the story and the writing style were that well done. 
 I would recommend Strangers on a Train to those who like to read thrillers and mysteries. Strangers on a Train has a very film noir feel to it and if you are in to that style, this novel is perfect for you!

 Initial Post Reading thoughts: 
 I didn't really know much about Stranger on a Train before I jumped into it. I had heard of it before, but other than that, I didn't really do any research. I decided to listen to it as an audiobook through Audible and I found I really enjoyed reading it that way. The narration from the points of view of Bruno kind of bothered me. The narrator was very whiny and he raised his voice a lot when reading in Bruno's perspective and it kind of irritated me while listening with headphones. I found the last half hour or so of this story slowed down a lot and I became slightly bored. The last few minutes were pretty great though!""",2015-03-07 19:21:09,Strangers on a Train,fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Patricia Highsmith
2377,5099602,2,"""Description: 
 Katsa is graced with killing, she can kill whomever she chooses, in whichever way. She lives with her uncle King Randa who uses her skill for his own benefits, she wants to get out and makes up a council with friends and family, who help people secretly, their mission this time is to save a kidnapped Grandfather Tealiff and send him home, but when a boy turns up, also graced, asking about his grandfather a new journey begins. 
 My Review: 
 *contains spoilers* 
 Ok, so to start off with I found this book to start off really slow, then about half way through the book it picked up for a while... then went slow again. Sometimes it was difficult to carry on reading but I always vowed to get to the end of books and give them a chance and I also wanted to find out what happened with Katsa and Po. 
 First of all I liked the idea of the storyline but sometimes it just became confusing with all the different names of the cities and the strange names of all the characters. 
 At the beginning Katsa seems quite cold and distant, after all she is graced with killing, she can kill anyone she wants, however she wants, she found this out by accidentally killing her cousin when she got angry. She lives with her uncle King Randa after she lost her parents a long time ago and he uses her for her power, sends her to frighten people or hurt them for his own reasons. So obviously stories have gone around the kingdoms about her and everyone is afraid of her. 
 She is involved in the Council which is secretly made up of a small amount of people, including her small amount of friends and cousin. They work together to help people without her uncle finding out. The main storyline comes about from this, when they learn that a old man known as Grandfather Tealiff from Lienid has been kidnapped. They locate him and infiltrate and get him back. In the process Katsa knocks everyone out instead of killing them and she comes across a boy, not like the other guards, who has strange eyes, one silver and one gold. Which means he's graced. She manages to also put him to sleep. 
 He later turns up at the Middluns where she is based and where Grandfather Tealiff is recuperating and asks to know what she knows and his Grandfather, she decides to trust him and tells him that they have him and he is fine. This leads the storyline on further, with Po and Katsa trying to find out who kidnapped him in the first place and why? They rule out some kingdoms and Po mentions King Leck, but Katsa wouldn't believe it, King Leck is known for his kindness especially to animals and children. But Po believes he is the only one it could be. 
 I liked the scenes with them fighting, teaching each other new tricks and finally Katsa feels she has someone who can delay her a while, for Po is quite the skilled fighter, but that is his grace, or is it? 
 Katsa figures out that Po can understand peoples thoughts and is hurt when she finds this out, I think at this point she'd been developing feelings for him and she feels betrayed that he didn't tell her the truth, she barges in all guns blazing but he puts her straight, he can't read people's minds, he can only sense thoughts and feelings that are directed or thought about him, he can't intrude on her private thoughts unless they are about him. Obviously it takes Katsa a while to get used to this, but she soon comes around and even plays around with him shouting towards him in her head. 
 She disobeys her uncle when he asks of her to hurt a man who will not give up his daughters for marriage, Katsa thinks this is unreasonable and tells him she won't do it. 
 She leaves with Po on horses to travel to Lienid and find out about King Leck, on the way they develop mutual feelings for one another but Katsa doesn't want to marry or have children, she believes she will lose herself and her control if she does so and tells Po this, he asks of her to consider being lovers instead and she is free to do as she pleases. Also on this journey Katsa realises that she doesn't have the grace to kill but the grace of survival, she can make herself sleep and for a set amount of time, she doesn't feel cold or warmth like most, she doesn't need food. I found this quite an interesting twist, but then it starts to get a little boring again as they travel along. 
 They finally get closer to Lienid and witness King Leck and his men killing his wife, he has the grace of making people believe things, and twists everyones version of himself. For some reason he is after his own daughter Princess Bitterblue, probably because she knows his secret, like her mother. 
 Po and Katsa manage to track her down in the woods after narrowly missing a death match with King Leck, but now he knows that Po isn't under his grace for some reason and wants him killed. 
 They find Bitterblue and carry on towards Lienid, but Po decides to head back when he senses that Leck and his men are after them, he gets hurt quite badly and decides he will stay behind and heal whilst they continue on, he finds a cave he can hide it if needs be. 
 Katsa reluctantly leaves Po behind and carries on with Katsa, Po gives Katsa his ring to her castle so she'll have no trouble with people believing her, the manage to weather a massive snow storm for a few days, make it to a ship and get transported to Lienid, to Po's castle. Here Leck is waiting for them with Po's family. Obviously Katsa and Bitterblue walk right into there unknowing and then Leck starts to tell his lies, even making Katsa believe them, Bitterblue tries her best to help Katsa but it doesn't seem to work until he is about to tell Po's whole family about his secret grace (only his mother and grandfather know about it) she manages to remember and throws her knife at King Leck nailing his mouth to his chair. 
 I was quite disappointed with his ending to be honest, I was expecting either something more brutal or a bit more of a fight, my reaction was ""Oh is that it? He's dead then"" 
 So he's dead and everyone seems to be going back to normal, they head back to find Po and finally find him, but when they all return to Lienid Katsa realises he seems strange, she questions him on it and at first seems cold and withdrawn but she later figures out he could be blind from his fall earlier. She questions him again and it turns out to be true, he can't see with his eyes, but he still has his grace which can picture animals, people and landscapes for him, which is quite lucky for him. He starts learning to fight again, because he may need those skills, and Katsa starts training girls how to fight. 
 Katsa and Po decide to leave together living in the wilderness and now Bitterblue is Queen taking over her father, they know she will do a great job. 
 So in theory I liked the storyline, I just think maybe it could have been executed a bit better, less dragging it on and more of the action.""",2013-02-24 10:07:27,"Graceling (Graceling Realm, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;romance;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Kristin Cashore

It's way cooler to say they are so good at controlling magic they can multicast way better then most people and came up with new spell things nobody has seen before then uses those to get their way out of normally impossible to escape situations.

2391,186074,3,"""Wow. Just one book. Just one fricking book and I can already label Patrick Rothfuss as a master wordweaver/worldbuilder. In THE NAME OF THE WIND, the narrator, Kvothe, is a simple barkeep at first glance, who tells his own story in the presence of the Chronicler and Bast, a fae servant to some obscure degree. His story starts nearly at the beginning of his life and he tells it fluidly, with perfect recollection, despite the occasional interruption, as you see, the book transports the reader back and forth between the tale Kvothe is telling and the events unfolding in the present, dire and foreboding events concerning the return of dark times. 
 One reviewer compared THE NAME OF THE WIND to Harry Potter, but Rothfuss is spinning a yarn deeper and more intricate than that of J.K. Rowling's Potterverse. I'm not sure what I was expecting, to be honest, but Rothfuss delivers something inventive, original, and rather unforeseen. This book is intelligently written. The overall voice is strong and certain. The main character, Kvothe, is clever, precocious, mysterious, likable one moment, feared the next--a deep protagonist who can certainly carry this trilogy. 
 My only complaint is it felt a bit redundant throughout, and got a little bogged down in the middle. I often felt like I was waiting for something to happen, and waiting. And waiting. I came away from THE NAME OF THE WIND feeling like I'd just read 700 pages of, basically, build-up to something much bigger; which, in fact, is the truth. I have a feeling that the proverbial sh*t is really going to hit the fan in book two of the Kingkiller Chronicle. And I plan to be there. Because for 700 pages of ""build-up,"" it was STILL that damn good. 
 So, hurry up, Pat!

2392,12985143,4,"""I'm not a big fan of werewolf reads, in fact I avoid them but the blurb for Hemlock and the beautiful cover had me at a debate on if I should give this a shot or not. So I did. How could I resist! 
 Every review I read prior to obtaining a copy of this book said that it was a nice twist on werewolves and I have to agree, it is. But I also have to be honest, I wasn't digging the first half of the book because it was based basically on the mythology behind the authors wolves, the murder case in relation to the attack and the really intense creepy people called Trackers. 
 By the time I got half way through the book, THAT'S when I couldn't put it down. This book would still be a fantastic read even if you took out the wolf element. It does add a bit of extra suspense but even without it, it would still be engaging. And believe me, I was NOT expecting the ending! 
 The thing I enjoyed the most was the background the author put into the situation, the people and Amy. Even though Amy's dead, we see a lot of her in Mac's dreams, we get to know her through Mac's dreams. So even though she's dead, it almost felt like she was there the whole time. 
 I think Mac was stubborn, foolish and hopeful. I get why she tries to save everyone but sometimes you just need to step back and let them figure it out on their own. Maybe her past has something to do with saving people, who knows. I loved Kyle. Love love loved Kyle. And I thought Jason was a jerk. The whole way through. Like seriously Mac, ditch the guy he's stupid. 
 I'm not anxiously awaiting the sequel to this book since I felt this could had easily been a fantastic stand alone but I am curious to see what trouble Mac can get herself into next!""",2011-10-07 13:36:48,"Hemlock (Hemlock, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Kathleen Peacock

All of the others are even afraid of him because of his master intimidation techniques and torture skills. He's their go-to guy to get answers from any of the bad guys because he will break fingers, shove things up their fingernails, tear off their fingernails, etc.. to get the truth from them. Hmmm, that's a lot of finger-hurting crap. He seems to have a phalanges fixation. 
 Kat is an FBI agent who is sent into the compound undercover to find the bad guy from the last book because her boss is a personal friend of his. Kat hates her boss and knows that the assignment is bullshit but what can she do? She goes in as a crime scene specialist to teach classes to the New Species on investigating and forensics. 
 When Kat enters Homeland, some hate group shows up and starts shooting and ramming the gates. She jumps into action! She shoots the driver and blows up the van, saving everyone. Yay, Kat, right? Um, wrong! The New Species know that some CSI tech wouldn't have those skills so she is brought in for questioning. And, by questioning, they mean that Darkness is going to torture her for information. Hide your phalanges, Kat!! 
 But, Darkness doesn't like hurting women, so he gives her the choice of: 
 A. Tell the truth 
 B. Be tortured until you tell the truth 
 C. Be raped until you tell the truth. 
 Darkness finds her attractive, so he's hoping for ""C"". He also has his fingers behind his back right now. 
 please pick ""C"" .... 
 Kat doesn't like her boss, doesn't trust his motivations because he is racist against the New Species, and wasn't planning on completing her mission anyway, but she's a professional, so of course she won't give up her cover. And, being a professional, she picks being raped. Cause, she's kind of attracted to her inquisitioner, might as well get a little somethin somethin from her time with him. 
 So, Darkness ties her up and starts messing with her goodies. But then, hey, guess what? The New Species decide to let her keep her cover and they will watch her to see what she's after. So, she gets to stay in a nice guest house and teach her classes after all. That worked out nicely, huh? 
 But, Darkness has touched her goodies already, so that means she is his. He moves in next door to her and asks her to have a ""sex only"" relationship with him. Of course she does!! Who doesn't want to have sex with a guy who threatened your fingers' health and then violated you? Not this girl! 
 There are rules to this ""relationship"" that Kat must follow if she wants to mess around with her torturer: 
 Darkness has to have her tied-up and handcuffed for the sex - that's fine. 
 She's not allowed to touch him ever - check. 
 He refuses to kiss her - okay, sounds reasonable. 
 He leaves immediately afterwards - she likes sleeping alone anyway. 
 No dates, dinners together, or talking - she understands. 
 This arrangement must be secret - she's good with secrets. 
 I think this is the start of something beautiful! 
 And, it is. A beautiful romantic story of a girl giving up every ounce of self-respect, pride, and dignity that she has to be with a complete douchebag.""",2016-03-22 16:02:28,"Darkness (New Species, #12)",fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Laurann Dohner

2398,17333426,2,"""I am utterly and completely torn on how to review this, so I'm going to do something I don't typically do and form a pros and cons list. 
 Pros: 
 * The pages are nice and thick. I don't know about anyone else, but that's just something I fancy. 
 * Some of the poetry is funny, and a piece of good, funny poetry can sometimes be hard to come by. 
 * Some of the pieces are thought-provoking and bring up very valid points about consumerism, relationships, and life in general. Honestly, when the poems are on point, they are seriously on point. That, alone, despite the rest of the review and the rating I settled on, made me want to give this book five stars. 
 Cons: 
 * Some of the poems require the art in the book to finish the joke; I don't like that. There's nothing wrong with the art enhancing the quality of the work, but I don't care for the fact that, without the picture, the poem couldn't stand on its own. 
 * Some of the poetry is just plain stupid. 
 * The book, as a whole, is more comedian-like work than pure, raw poetry. And that's not completely unexpected because it is, in fact, a comedian who wrote it, but I'm not really sure it should be labeled as a ""poetry"" book. 
 Overall, I chose two stars because, while some of the work is gripping, most of it falls short. Don't get me wrong, I was a fan of Bo Burnham long before he started writing this; I just think, given some of the things he's come up with in the past, this could have been so much better than it was. That being said, he probably meant it to be exactly the way it is. I give him props for creating a book that is a nearly perfect representation of himself.""",2013-11-22 17:42:59,"Egghead: Or, You Can't Survive on Ideas Alone",poetry;non-fiction;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography,Bo Burnham;Chance Bone
2399,14064,3,"""I had to crawl out from under a rock to read this book. I actually didn't know the first thing about it beyond that it was supposed to be some sort of classic science fiction story. If I had known what it was about, I might have saved it for another time. I'm now realizing that the cover I shelved makes the content really obvious, but I rarely pay attention to the covers when I shelve a book. I just shelve the first edition I find when I search for a title; I don't like to waste time finding the precise edition I own. I do start from the cover when I read my e-books, but the cover in my actual e-book edition is different and doesn't give any clues. 
 Even without the cover cluing me in, it was pretty obvious to me within the first page, if not the first paragraph, that this would be a vampire story. Actually, I thought it had more of a zombie feel to it, based on how most of the vampires behaved. I have a limited tolerance for those types of stories, and I'd already read a zombie book earlier this year. This book is only 160 pages though, so it's a very quick read, and it held my interest. The middle third of the book dragged a little for me, but I enjoyed the rest of it and became particularly interested in it toward the end. 
 The story centers around one man, Robert Neville, who believes he's the last normal human alive. I thought Robert was a rather inconsistent character, sometimes making really dumb decisions and sometimes appearing pretty intelligent. He's an alcoholic, and he definitely has psychological issues. This may all be pretty realistic considering the trauma he's been through and the horrors he's seen, but he's the kind of character who tends to get on my nerves. He reacts emotionally to everything, and usually in such a way that just makes things worse. 
 Despite the vampires, I do think this is more science fiction than fantasy. The author tried to create scientific explanations for the condition of vampirism and our main character spends some time researching related topics to try to understand what happened. I don't know if those explanations would sound the slightest bit plausible to anybody with a medical background, but my own ignorance generated a reaction that was mostly along the lines of ""Ok, sure, whatever."" 
 The book was written in 1954, but it really didn't feel dated to me. Actually, there were a few times when fictional events from the early to mid-1970's were referenced and I did a double take, because I'd forgotten that the 1970's were the future from the perspective of the author. Other than that, there's nothing much about the story that makes it feel dated. 
 The ending was interesting, but not terribly surprising for me because it was similar to the ending of another more recently-written book that I've read. I don't want to name that book for fear of spoiling the ending of either book for somebody who has read one but not the other, but I imagine people who have read both might know what I'm talking about. 
 Over all I enjoyed the story and, like I said, it's a really fast read. The main reason I'm not rating it higher is because it got pretty tedious in the middle and because the main character got on my nerves quite a bit.""",2016-07-01 11:34:50,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson

2407,29780253,5,"""I confess I didn't know who Trevor Noah was, but I began seeing his book on many ""best of"" lists and in my Goodreads feed. When I found out the meaning of the title, that he was literally born a crime in South Africa under apartheid because his mother is black and his father is white, I knew I had to read it. 
 It was illegal to be ""colored"", the term used in SA for a person of mixed race. His very existence was a crime. His mother often pretended to be his maid so she could take him out in public. Noah tells us how he navigated extreme poverty and a social system where he never fit in anywhere, even after apartheid ended. But he was quite the enterprising, mischievous boy, which makes for much of the humor in the book. 
 What makes this book shine though is Noah himself narrates the audiobook. He's funny, intelligent and charming. He can make even a horrific situation funny. The tales of poverty, domestic abuse, and racism is sad yet Noah's comedic talents in telling the story blunts some of the horrors (at least until a particularly horrific event near the end). 
 How a boy raised in these difficult circumstances rises to become the replacement for Jon Stewart on the Daily Show is nothing short of amazing and is a testament to his resilience, grit, and the blessing of a loving yet tough mother. Yet Noah doesn't speak about his rise to fame, or his role on The Daily Show. His reason for writing was not to puff himself up, and regale us with tales on his road to fame. The reader leaves educated and more aware of the effects of poverty, abuse, racism, and how a political system like apartheid affects those who live under it. 
 I was both entertained and educated. It doesn't get better than that. Highly recommended, especially the audiobook - to hear Noah tell his story in his own words, with comedic timing, and the inflections and accents used for different people, is priceless.""",2017-06-20 19:53:24,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah

2409,13449677,3,"""Listen, I won't lie to you guys. I full expected to hate this book. I mean, that cover and the description. Those things do not scream ""CHRISTINA WILL LOVE THIS,"" and, in fact, generally send me screaming in the opposite direction. However, Steph put this in the Sadie Hawkins list, and even generously purchased a copy for me, so I went into it with as open a mind as possible. Well, surprise! The Collector actually turned out to be a highly entertaining read, full of humor and a unique protagonist. 
 Okay, so Dante is just as much of an ass as he comes off from the description and the cover. Since I hate cocky guys, I expected to want to kick him in the balls all the way through the book, but he really wasn't as bad as I was expecting. He's a cocky jerk, but really no worse than your average pampered, neglected teen. What's cool about his perspective is that Scott takes a risk with him as a narrator. If Charlie narrated this, The Collector would be a standard formula paranormal romance and Dante would appear a nicer guy overall. 
 See, I feel like Dante's just like a lot of the paranormal heroes in YA, only we have unrestricted access to his thought processes, not all of which are pleasant. He judges women on their appearance, often using derogatory terms like fugly. He also thinks shit like this: ""If Charlie doesn't dig my get up, I'll expose her for what she is: asexual."" The latter does keep me from ever really rooting for him. On the other hand, I don't completely hate him, because most of what he says and does is polite, even defending Charlie's looks to a rude salesperson, early on enough in the book that it's not because he's matured yet. If you're really in someone's head, you're going to see a lot of non-flattering thoughts, so if you judge Dante on his actions more than his thoughts, yeah, he's still not a great guy, but he's redeemable. This seems more realistic than the mysterious hot new guy finding all of a girl's flaws adorable right from the get go. For the record, though, I don't think he's hot and would never want him to be my book boyfriend. 
 The best aspect of The Collector is Victoria Scott's talent for humor. A lot of lines made me smile or snort. The tone of The Collector stays pretty light and the book doesn't take itself too seriously, which is another way Scott's novel distinguishes itself from the bulk of paranormal romance offerings.There's an element of tongue-in-cheek to Dante, in which he exaggerates his own personality to make fun of himself and lighten a tense moment. He's not always entirely serious when he says outlandish things, just mostly serious. 
 Though predictable, I also really appreciated the way Dante learned from Charlie's friend group. She has two best friends, Annabelle and Blue. They let Dante into their group pretty readily, after making sure he knows they'll defend Charlie with everything they've got. The moments where the three of them just hang out together are brilliant, and I especially loved the tentative friendship between Blue and Dante, despite their rivalry for Charlie's affections. 
 Where The Collector lost me somewhat was everything about Dante's relationship with Charlie. Thought I don't hate Dante, I still don't think they make a good couple, and shipped her more with Blue. The fact that their relationship is forced into such a short time frame only exacerbated my disinclination towards their relationship. Instalove is a huge turn off, especially when I already wasn't digging them as a couple. Sure, Dante didn't like her at first, but Charlie claims to have loved him from the start and falling love in less than ten days is still instalove to me anyway. While I did buy some of Dante's emotional arc, I never felt sold on his feelings for Charlie and they definitely came on too strong and too fast. It's also pretty questionable that they came on stronger in proportion to her attractiveness. 
 If you're a fan of humorous paranormal romance, you will most assuredly want to seek out The Collector. Though The Collector was not a perfect read for me, I am curious enough to pick up the next installment in the Dante Walker series, The Liberator, if I can get my hands on it.""",2013-04-12 07:40:37,"The Collector (Dante Walker, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Victoria Scott
2410,12505535,3,"""There are a lot of dystopian elements going on in here. Like a lot. Corrupt government. Check. Revised history. Check. Creepy ways to track all citizens. Check. Mysterious deaths. Check. Religion replaced with patriotism (The Inclusion). Check. Evil adults! Check, although that's not so much dystopian as MG/YA, but whatevs. So yeah, lots of things. They do all seem to nest pretty well and believably, which is good. Sometimes authors try to make too many things happen in their books, and it ends up feeling like a forced, cluttered mess, but not so Swipe. 
 Swipe is getting added to the list of books that tells me to stop being all judgey judge about books based on the publisher. Like Halflings, Swipe is published by Thomas Nelson, a Christian publisher. I have nothing against Christians, but I cannot deal with inspirational fiction at all, like when every chapter starts with a Bible verse and everyone's always praying and praising the lord (Hallelujah!) every other paragraph. However, these books are reminders to me that just because a novel is published under the Christian fiction umbrella, it really doesn't have to mean that it's pushing a religious message all up in your face. 
 Oddly, Swipe reminded me of The Immortal Rules, despite being for completely different age groups, and mostly different dystopians. What they share, though, is the mark. In Kagawa's I believe that the registered are branded or tattooed or something, which earns them a right to food from the vampire government. In Swipe, there's a similar system. People can choose not to be marked at the age of 13, but that means you're not getting anything. Son, you're on your own. Basically, the government is saying that unless you let us track you, you'll have to become a criminal to survive, so you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. Nice. 
 The only thing that really didn't jive with me was the Dust. I have trouble seeing how the government could have trouble stopping that movement. I mean, they know where a lot of them are, and it's not like the people would really care. It just seems like, so far as resistance movements go, the Dust was pretty lame, and should have been easily nipped in the bud. Perhaps, though, this will receive explication later on. 
 Much of the story reads like a dystopian mystery. Erin and Logan take on the role of teenage sleuths to figure out who is watching Logan, and what Erin's dad is doing in Spokie. Swipe reads somewhere between middle grade and young adult, perhaps ideally aimed at folks in their young teens.

Admittedly, I knew very little about it before I began reading, but I did know that Bullen has another book called Wish, so I thought maybe she just wrote the same plot over and over. I still don't know about that, but I am impressed enough by this book that I am not super concerned. 
 Hazel is a likable heroine. She struggles with selfishness and self-doubt, but who doesn't? Despite all the things she has always wanted, she does not waste her wishes or use them swiftly. In fact, it takes almost half the book until she uses her second wish. Not many people would show such restraint. 
 Bullen also used the time travel plot (caused by her first wish) well. She acknowledged the awkwardness inherent in falling in love with someone in the past. She also covers issues associated with teen pregnancy without preaching for one side of the debate or another. The best part was the way she conveyed the message that view, both in photography and of one's life, is incredibly important. There may be wonderful things in your life that you're missing, because you cannot see the best in yourself and are not open to others.

2414,186074,4,"""This book has been majorly hyped in my circles, so even though I was excited to pick it up, I did so with a bit of trepidation. It took me nearly a month to finish this 722 page monster. Now that I have I can see why The Name of the Wind is getting so much hype. 
 I only recently started getting into reading high fantasy, and in this short time I've begun to notice a pattern. Typically the beginning is very slow and drawn out. Authors try to give us a sense of the main characters, the world, and the conflict. Once these key factors are set aside, there is usually some gruesome scenes of violence, death, torture: some nobles thinking their better than everyone, a dash of misogyny, maybe a love interest, and magic sprinkled in to give things a little flair. Despite the repetition I am a huge fan of the genre. However, I like a little change every now and then, and Patrick Rothfuss manages to pretty much bypass all of these tropes and produce such a rich and complex story. 
 The Name of the Wind follows Kvothe, a legendary sorcerer who has been made so either by deeds he did and are widely blown out of proportion, or by complete fabrications. Now Kvothe is setting the record straight and telling his story in his own words. From his childhood growing up the son of troupers, his first teacher, his time spent living in the slums, and his admission into the prestigious University. His voice is eloquent and at times beautifully poetic. 
 While I'll say that I didn't entirely love Kvothe in everything, I did respect him and was intrigued by his story and the mystery behind his name. He can come off as little full of himself which annoyed me at times. Yes, you're clever, but no need to keep reminding us of that. However, putting that aside he is a very complex character who is so different from any other character I've come across in a fantasy novel. He is the underdog who you really want to win. He has flaws that he doesn't try to hide them He is also giving and kind to those he loves. However, I wouldn't recommend getting on his bad side. This is the first in a trilogy and I'm very interested to see how Kvothe changes throughout his adventures. 
 The world that Rothfuss created on the surface isn't anything special. At least I thought so at first. I thought it was very standard nothing out of the ordinary in a fantasy novel. However, when you factor in the magic, mythology, and culture you start seeing how much detail was put into this world. I was fascinated by the magic in this book. It has an almost mathematical and scientific quality to it. Also the Fae or Chandrian just made my hair rise thinking about them. The University was interesting and being the huge nerd that I am I couldn't help but just want to be transported there and roam the archives. However, I'm not entirely sure I would like to be a student there. The power trip among the professors is very cringe worthy. 
 The size of this book can be daunting especially when you factor in its companion novel which is even bigger. As I said it took me nearly a month to get through it. Some of it was because life got in the way, and another part was the slow start. I feel like much of the passages could have been condensed, or cut out entirely because they were more like filler material rather plot development. The plot does have a nice even pace after the initial slow start. The ending isn't a cliffhanger, but it does leave questions unanswered. Question which I am guessing will be answered in A Wise Man's Fear Rothfuss foreshadows and gives the reader an indication of where the story might be headed, but doesn't reveal anything. 
 Overall I really liked it. It had everything I loved about the fantasy genre, yet it it was in a category all on its own.

 I wanted to read the replaced because I remember really enjoying the first one. even though I really don't have a whole lot of memory about it besides I liked the romance all the complication of her disappearing and then coming back as well as the whole alien angle. 
 It got right back into the mix of the story with her at a camp for the returned people who have been taken by aliens and then brought back to Earth. she's with some guys I guess you met last time and she really believe that they had gotten into the aliens security system somehow and she got a message from her dad but the guys with her didn't believe her and it really frustrated her that what she saw from them was pity. Their mission brought the action level up a notch, and it was slowly integrated into the story the details from the first, and I remembered things or just was able to follow along as the story progresses. 
 There were a few twists in the story, and I was reeling from a few of the things revealed. Some of the people from Kyra's past and how they work into the story. I wasn't sure how I felt about that as well as the semi forming other attraction. 
 But honestly, I think that The Replaced had a few ""big"" reveals that just didn't shock me and couldn't figure out why it did Kyra and company. And it fell into a bit of the formulaic second book syndrome-- oh look, we have a main character who has to go into hiding with some of the people that she met at end of first book, not sure who we can trust, go on several road trips following half leads, face off with the nemesis, escape, rescue mission, oh look, here we are in the car again. Then a reveal and the ending. 
 While I didn't hate this and did want to get through to the ending hoping for Tyler's appearance, I just wasn't enamored. Not sure if I will continue with the series because of one of the twists. 
 Bottom Line: Some surprises but mostly the paranormal second book syndrome in play.""",2014-08-24 15:20:22,"The Replaced (The Taking, #2)",young-adult;fiction;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime,Kimberly Derting

 If you'd like to see my full review, check out A Bookish Nerd. 
 While I didn't hate this book, I didn't like it. Two of the main characters, Scarlet and Juliet, were crazy. They stalked people. They were obsessed. If that doesn't send you running for the hills, they're also very whiny. Too whiny. I don't mind a little bit of complaining when it's called for, but they did it ALL THE TIME. 
 The romance was weak. Scarlet falls in love with Juliet's husband. If that isn't bad enough, Juliet is also pregnant with his child. Scarlet has it in her head that Juliet can love him like she can. She's determined to make him realize that he belongs with her. They're terrible perfect for each other. If falling for someone's husband isn't bad enough, it's also a typical case of insta-love. Which is just sooo swoon-worthy, right? 
 UGH. 
 The only reasons I didn't give this one star was because of the wonderful writing style and Hayden. I enjoyed Caletti's uniqueness. There were also some amazing quotes as well. I liked Hayden because he wasn't crazy. He's just an imperfect man trying to do the right thing for himself, his wife, and his unborn child. I respected him even if he didn't make all of the right decisions. The main idea here is that he had good intentions.

2426,64482,5,"""I've mentioned once or thrice that where I work we have constant book donations coming in, and before we add them to our collection I get to peruse them and take what I want to read. It's a fringe benefit that has saved me hundreds of dollars. Anyways, the other day a box of books showed up on my desk with a note. It said: Thought you might like these. No name was attached. It was like a mystery. Who would send me these books? What could be in this box that someone else might think I wanted to read? 
 When I unloaded the box of books on my desk, I found that most of the titles related to the ""chick-lit"" variety. My excitement waned. I'm not much into reading the feely-feel good type of stuff. I took the books and placed them back in the box and then set the box out on a community table. I returned to my desk and found that I had forgotten a book. LET THE NORTHERN LIGHTS ERASE YOUR NAME by Vendela Vida. An author I had never heard of before. I don't know why I exactly turned the book over to read the synopsis, but when I did I saw that George Saunders gave an endorsement of how wonderful the writing style was. He mentioned something about how the Spartan-quality of the writing showed that impacting novels need not be verbose. I turned to the first chapter and read it. (The chapters are short: 1-3 pages each.) He was right. The writing was beautiful. Over the next two days, I stole whatever time I had and read the book, neglecting all my other reading in the process. 
 The story is simple: a woman tries to piece her life back together after having suffered the emotional effects of a mother running out on her when she was still a girl; a father who passes away, but is later revealed not to be her father at all; and a mystery that brings her to Lapland, a place above the Arctic Circle. This storyline does not do justice to how wonderful this novel is. In fact, I dare say that the storyline is only a means to conveying what the real story is: How do we handle being alone when we get older? Sure all of us at one time or another during college relished our newly found freedom, thinking that life could not get any better. But, and I am not ashamed to admit this, the ability to come back to a family, people that know you, love you, want to be with you, was never too far from my mind. It was a safety blanket that kept the bitterness of loneliness at bay. 
 Vida remarkably describes these feelings and scenarios through prose that zings across the page. More than once I thought about Hemingway's writing while I read this. But Vida has heart and compassion and truth, qualities I find lacking in Hemingway. The prose is crushing at times, leaving the reader feeling as if they have intentionally buried themselves in a snowdrift, but can't get out...desperate now to find a way to survive. These moments of claustrophobia add a dimension to the story that makes the characters more than three dimensional; it makes them seem as if the reader could be starring in this story. The descriptions are sometimes surreal but never garish as if trying to say: Look at me! Don't you see how clever I can be when I describe something? 
 It is not until the last thirty pages or so that the build up of the novel truly forms itself. In a way, it might be prudent to say that the first 190 pages or so where just exposition for this final showdown. (I don't do spoilers, so I apologize for the vagueness.) And when I finished, last night, down in my home office, I quietly shut the book and thought about my father and mother and brothers and sisters and wondered what they were doing, how their lives are so mysterious to me since we all became adults. These thoughts made me very melancholy and I ached for their voices. I just wanted to say hi, ask about their children, their days, what's new. But it was late and I was left with only my thoughts and the ticking sound of a clock. Perhaps this novel is better defined as a ghost-story for the reader, or a fragile family epic. 
 Intrigued, I decided to look on the internet to see what reviews I could find about the book. There aren't many. But what I did find was this: Vendela Vida is married to Dave Eggers. I've never read a full Eggers book, but I can say this with the utmost confidence: If ever asked who the writer in the family is, Ms. Vida can confidently stand and say: Me.

2432,14975,2,"""In Labyrinth, the lives of two women living 800 years apart are intertwined. When the book opens, Alice is helping out at an archeological dig site in present-day Southern France, and Alais is a young woman living in Carcassonne in the 1200s, on the cusp of the crusade against the Cathars in that area. As the book continues, both women respectively get drawn further into the world of the Cathars (or Bonnes Hommes as they called themselves in Alais' time) and the secret of the labyrinth and the grail that several chosen people have guarded over centuries. 
 The book is structured to alternate between the past and the present, focusing on the perspectives of the two women and those with whom they interact. The sections set in the past read like any other not-so-well-written-but-still-interesting historical fiction book, with a bit of mystery and supernatural thrown in. I don't know much about the time period of which Mosse writes, but it seems as though she must have done a lot of research. At times, this interrupts the flow of the story, and the book feels a bit like reading a travel guide to Carcassonne or a textbook about 13th century France. But in other moments, I found the historical detail to be interesting - I liked the descriptions of the countryside and life inside the fortified castle walls. I'm not sure how accurate Mosse is, but if she is accurate, then I probably learned a lot about the history of the Languedoc region of France reading this book. 
 The sections set in the present felt to me like watching a poorly executed action film. There are car chases, the obligatory explosion, shadowy people following innocent victims, kidnapping, etc. If you like that sort of thing, then maybe this aspect of the book wouldn't bother you. But I dislike that sort of thing (unless, of course, the chase is on horseback and the bad guys carry swords instead of guns!), so I found the sections set in the present to be significantly less interesting. Not to mention that Mosse uses the same amount of detail in describing the present that she uses for the past - most of it does not add to the feel of scenes or setting. 
 But the biggest drawback of the book is the way that all of the characters are completely one-dimensional. Mosse seemingly makes no effort to surprise the reader about people's pasts, motivations, or what ""side"" they are on. Even the acts of treachery or redemption are completely obvious before they occur. And the superficial way that there is a correspondence between certain characters in the past and certain characters in the present just hammers the frustration of all this transparency home. To me, it isn't clever or exciting that these correspondences are obvious down to the words Mosse chooses (clearly on purpose) to link the past and present characters' physical appearances. 
 Nevertheless, I did grow interested in some of the characters and by the end was certainly eager to find out what would eventually happen. But the book is over 500 pages long, a lot of that filled with seemingly needless description, so it just takes too long to get to the end. This book is really the kind of thing that sounds much more interesting in theory then in actuality. I think Mosse did a lot of research, she probably became close to her subject matter, and for that she can be commended. But it just doesn't add up to a good read, at least not for me.""",2010-06-02 17:17:30,"Labyrinth (Languedoc, #1)",fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime;romance,Kate Mosse

 This is a fictional novel based on the facts of Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, ""The Paris Wife"", Hadley Richardson.

I love them more than vampires but strangely enough if you compare how much werewolf books I actually love to the number of vampire books I actually love then you would be quite confused because the ratio or pie chart you are looking at would not support the first sentence of this review and you would then ask me to explain myself. My explanation to why I love more vampire novels than werewolf novels is that I am extremely picky when it comes to reading about werewolves, but only in YA. When it comes to adult books I love my Kelley Armstrong and Patricia Briggs but when it comes to YA the werewolf books I come across most of the time are too tame or saturated with romance for my blood thirsty and cynical heart. I voiced some of these thoughts while standing in one of the many lines at BEA this year and someone (I think it was Kristen [you don't who Kristen is dear reader]) asked me if I had read Hemlock, I said no and she recommended it. So I picked up Hemlock or downloaded it from amazon to be precise and quickly began reading. 
 In the world of Hemlock it is public knowledge that werewolves exist and the world has adjusted to this knowledge the way it always does when confronted with something it does not understand and fear - with hate and prejudice. If you are a werewolf you have no human rights. If you are a werewolf you are no longer allowed to live in normal society because you are a threat to normal people. If you are a werewolf you are taken from everything you know and are forced to live in a ""camp"" with others of your kind for the rest of your life; that is if you aren't killed during the transfer or before the authorities can get to you by your neighbours. Hell, if you are suspected of being a werewolf you have no rights until it's proven you are not a werewolf. 
 In the small town of Hemlock Mackenzie's best friend Amy has been killed by a werewolf and she was not the only victim. However, she was the victim who gained the most media attention because she was the granddaughter of a politician. Unfortunately the white werewolf in question was never captured and after months of peace it seems the white werewolf is back and killing again or is this one completely new? What could be more dangerous than a werewolf roaming around, however, are the group of Trackers who have been invited to the town. The Trackers are a radical group of extremists who have been given free rein by the local police to do pretty much whatever it takes to find the killer werewolf no matter who gets in the way. 
 Hemlock was a mystery filled with high-stakes action scenes, compelling drama and a whole cast of unique and diverse characters. Mackenzie is a strong MC who is determined to find out the identity of Amy's murderer, keep her friend Jason from falling to the wayside, and figure out the mix signals she keeps getting from her long time best friend Kyle. Unfortunately for Mackenzie the more she discovers about the night Amy died the more dangerous her life becomes and the more she realizes how little she knows about those closest to her. 
 I didn't fall irrevocably in love with Hemlock but I did enjoy myself as I read it. There was romance but it wasn't painted throughout all the pages and had me choking on sentiment, there was danger, drama, and many different levels of conflict. There were also twists popping up at every turn and if there is something I love more than werewolves it's a good twist.""",2011-10-05 13:21:28,"Hemlock (Hemlock, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Kathleen Peacock
2442,5099602,4,"""In the world of Graceling there are two distinct kinds of people - those that are graced and those that are not. The skills of the graced from what I have seen so far in this first book of Kristin Cashore's fantasy series are not as flamboyant or should I say obvious as what you would find in, for example, a comic book. There are no lasers shooting out of people's eyes, or tornado's being formed with a mere thought, the gracelings are what I would describe as unnaturally gifted. A normal person gifted in fighting would beat his or her opponent with almost ease, a person graced in fighting could have a broken arm, be faced off against five people and would still never lose a fight. The gracelings could be the most talented dancers, swimmers, runners, singers, weavers etc. or they could have far more dangerous talents. 
 Katsa's grace allowed her to kill a man when she was eight years old with one hand and from this moment on she has been used by her uncle, King Reyard, to strike fear into the heart of anyone who wrongs him. This along with her particular grace has made others who have not even met Katsa fear her, and her upbringing has not made Katsa the most typical of noble ladies. Still, Katsa despite not seeing herself as anything more than a tyrant leads covert operations where she helps people who need it and more and more recently she is finding it much more difficult to carry out her uncle's orders. And what really sets things off is while on a mission Katsa encounters a graced fighter who unexpectedly helps her unravel the peculiarities of her own grace as well as the shocking secrets of a foreign kingdom. 
 The story of Graceling for me was truly about not allowing yourself to be shaped by other people's predetermined thoughts of who you are and about being able to achieve anything as long as you never give up despite the odds. Graceling was also filled with such a diverse combination of awesome characters that ranged from brilliant to kick butt that I can't wait to meet them again in Fire and Bitterblue.""",2009-08-31 11:44:45,"Graceling (Graceling Realm, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;romance;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Kristin Cashore

 Strawberry Summer follows Margaret 'Maggie' Beringer, a small-town girl whose family own the local strawberry farm, and mysterious and devastatingly gorgeous department store heiress Courtney Carrington. After five years of no contact following their break up, they meet each other again when Courtney returns to town following her father's death. Following the timeline of their relationship, from the moment they met as teenagers, to the moment they meet again and beyond, the reader falls in love with them falling in love, and gets to experience the highs and lows they have together. 
 Holy moly, this book emotionally destroyed me in the best possible way. There was the perfect blend of passion, love, and angst, and I was completely enraptured from beginning to end. It's hauntingly beautiful, and the connection between them stays with you long after you've read it. 
 I really appreciated the flashbacks that we got (most of the book was recounting the previous seven+ years of their relationship) because it totally added to the emotional strength of their story and how much their reunion meant. I think without those flashbacks, and therefore this book solely being about their reconnection as both friends and a couple, it wouldn't have been nearly as good as it actually is. 
 I felt everything that they felt. I truly believed that Courtney and Maggie were the loves of each other's lives, and the fact that they got a happy ending made my heart swell. 
 This is one of those books I wish I could read for the first time over and over again because the genuineness of it absolutely struck me. Everyone in this book was real to me. No one seemed to be two-dimensional, and even the secondary characters had a warmth and depth to them that only a good writer could give them. 
 I welled up reading this, that's how much it affected me. 
 If I could give this more than five stars then I absolutely would. This is the F/F romance I've been waiting to read. It's crushingly gorgeous. It's heartwarming. It's absolutely everything you could ever hope for.""",2017-02-27 16:56:14,Strawberry Summer,romance;young-adult;fiction,Melissa Brayden

 Last year Kimberly Derting released the first book in her new series called The Taking. The novel actually surprised me, because I didn't expect it to involve aliens. But it did and I kinda liked it anyway. I'm sceptical about aliens - despite the fact vampires and witches don't bother me, but there's just something about aliens. I was interested to see where the series would go regardless and nearly died of excitement when I saw The Replaced up on Edelweiss and I pushed aside all my other reads to get started on The Replaced. 
 The Replaced actually disappointed me somewhat. It's your typical middle novel, with very little action and the plot wasn't pushed forward as much as I would have liked, at least not until the very end. That's when all the action really kicked in and I wished that it had been that way the whole novel. Because those last few chapters really had my heart racing and I'm curious once again to read the last book in the series because it didn't half leave with a cliffhanger. 
 One of my favourite parts of The Taking was the romance between Kyra and Tyler, it was fantastic and so heart warming and just got me all giddy inside and that was missing in The Replaced. Instead we got a trope love triangle which wasn't really a triangle since Tyler was missing. And I didn't like Simon. It just seemed out of left field and I barely remembered Simon from the first book and I was totally shipping Kyra and Tyler and for Tyler to be gone and Simon to be in his place just felt wrong. I just couldn't get on board with it. 
 I wanted so much more from The Replaced. There wasn't much happening in the plot, like I said most of the action came too late, as the book was ending. It wasn't a bad book, though, I just felt it was a filler novel. The real action is clearly coming in book three, and this was just the book to get us from book one to book three. In a way, I almost wish it had just been a standalone, but I'll reserve full judgement of that until I've completed the series. I'm still not all that sure about aliens, it's still a bit freaky for me, but the premise is still interesting and some of the revelations were intriguing enough for me to keep reading.""",2014-12-26 05:45:07,"The Replaced (The Taking, #2)",young-adult;fiction;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime,Kimberly Derting

Freaking MARVELOUS! This book was engaging, raw and heartfelt and I loved every page of it. Zusak is truly a master story teller. I had quite a few tiny problems with this book that kept it from that flawless five star rating, but overall I was so surprised by how much this novel moved me. I'll admit I was nervous to pick this up. With The Book Thief being one of my all time favorite books, I was scared to be disappointed. That my relationship with this author would only be tied to a single novel was a frightening though. And well, it's not near as good as TBT, and I think it's important to know that going into it. It's completely different in tone and writing and just about everything else. But dang, this book was still great in its own way. The main character Ed was such a lovable guy, yet flawed and relatable. Same goes for the many characters met along the way, though I'd say my Marv and the Priest were my favorites. I loved the messages though the ending was a tad bit weird.

 The stranger turns out to be her boss, AidanTruitt, who he is incredibly good looking, swoon-worthy and oh, so romantic! (When he finds that she is claustrophobic, he takes the stairs with her, even when his apartment is on the twelfth freaking floor. Where can you find such boys? Oh yes, in a BOOK.) 
 Besides the relationship being forbidden due to no fraternizing policy at work, there is also the issue that Aidan does not date anyone because his father was a jerk, who treated him and his mom badly and walked out on them. Aidan is scared that he is just like his father. I love this man! *sighs* I wish we had some chapters from his POV.

 But, man! don't you write off his charm because you won't even realize and he will sweep you off your feet. I don't know when and how I fell head over heels in love with him. I'm completely smitten by this alpha male bad boy who made me swoon with his swag and awesome one-liners. He made me smile so many times. Yes, his ego is too big and yes, sometimes you would want to just slap him across the face but what he is not is boring. He will keep you hooked and that just works so well for the book. 
 I didn't want to like him but I couldn't help it. Especially when he showed his soft side. He talks big but behinds all this tough guy act he still has a heart in the right place. He does start to care about Charlie and I loved whenever he took a stand for her. I'm am in Team Dante all the way. I'm sorry for all the rambling but Dante just has that kind of effect. Wait, till you read it. 
 Now, let's talk about Charlie. It's so easy to love this girl. She is so sweet and innocent. She sees the good in people and likes to help others. But what she is not is pretty, well, according to Dante anyway. She is an average girl who is lost in the crowd. 
 My eyes widen at the sight of her. This is the girl Boss Man is after? She looks like a porcelain doll...beat three times with an ugly stick. I take it all in: glasses, frizzy blond hair, a spray of pimples, and a stick figure so not attractive on a seventeen-year-old girl. 
 You see, why I want to slap Dante? 
 So it's easy to understand why she took the deal and made the choice. 
 Like Max said, 
 ""People change when shit happens."" 
 I would really praise the author for creating such like-able characters. Dante's POV is distinctly male and Charlie is real and relate-able. I can understand why she was attracted to Dante, I mean, come-freaking'-on who wasn't? I also loved Annabelle. She is so cool and her interactions with Dante are just hilarious. I liked Blue too, especially when he wasn't being a jerk to Dante but I don't really blame him for it either. Charlie really has some great friends who care about her and in that sense she is incredibly lucky. 
 ""I'll never understand the friendships Charlie has. Friendships where it doesn't take cash or hookups, or saying the right things to stay in the circle. No, Charlie's friendships are different. She tries to protect her people, and they in turn protect her. They accept each other's imperfections and support one another. My friends weren't like her friends, which makes me wonder if I ever had any at all."" 
 The plot is original and really interesting. The book is really entertaining and so hilarious. It's really hard to make people laugh, so again, kudos to the author for this feat. The serious scenes are also handled well and have depth. It's not a perfect book but it's pretty close.

 ___Original Review____ 
 A really good book. Rothfuss constructs his world so that the fantasy tropes he adheres to feel fresh and almost original. I am also impressed with his mastery of description. Next time I run out of poetic imagery I will try to remember his style. I also really liked the lyrical quality of some of Kvothe's lines. 
 Another pro: this book contains one of my favorite depictions of dragons, ever. 
 The biggest disappointment for me was realizing about 100 pages from the end that there wasn't nearly enough space left for even a partial resolution of the many plot threads. It turns out that Rothfuss is playing the long game, and many of the plot promises won't be fulfilled until later in the series. I look forward to reading book 2 when it comes out next year. 
 I do have to say, though, that I felt there were an excessive number of chapter-ending cliff hangers and false reveals. Some of them were extremely well executed, but others seemed out of place and distracting from the natural tension of the story. There were other disappointments, too, but these were probably due more to my personal preference than to the writing itself. 
 I'm suspending my verdict on the story-within-a-story framework. There were places, especially towards the beginning, that it didn't quite work for me. The disconnect of voice and tone made the transitions rough, but given what we are told of Kvothe I can see how that might be the point. I'll have to wait for the rest of the trilogy to find out if the bumps were both intentional and justified.""",2010-10-11 19:10:54,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss
2470,32620360,1,"""I love Renee Carlino, Before We Were Strangers is one of my favorite books of all time, so it kills me to say I really didn't like this book. A one star review might seem extremely harsh, but I honestly couldn't think of one thing I actually liked about this story. This book follows this girl named Charlotte who is a waitress in Los Angeles, randomly one night she meets this guy named Adam who recently quit his job as a lawyer to paint full time. They share one night together, and then he acts weird the next day and they lose touch. Seven months later, she is still hung up on him (even when she casually starts seeing someone else), and then she finds out why Adam was acting so strange with her. 
 Charlotte is one of the most obnoxious, judgmental, selfish protagonists I've read about in a long time. She was constantly bitching about something, and her attitude and judginess really got on my nerves. She judges people over the stupidest shit all the time: for example, she's always judging ""dog people"" and she does it more than once. Like excuse me, what the fuck is wrong with liking dogs? She also judges someone for still being in college at the age of twenty-five. She judges her best friend for wanting to do something spontaneous and romantic even though she LITERALLY DID THE SAME SHIT WITH ADAM. She only thinks about herself, and is constantly bitching about how hung up she is on Adam and treats Seth like shit. She bitches about how much it sucks to be rejected by Adam and then literally does the same shit to Seth all the time. I just couldn't fucking stand her. 
 Not to mention, Adam and Charlotte's first night together was totally cringe-worthy and ridiculous and he was giving off so many red flags and he was way too forward for a first date. I didn't think he was ""charming"" he was actually giving me really creepy vibes but of course our protagonist thought he was just so cute. Charlotte keeps commenting on it too, in her inner dialogue, she's wondering why he's so strange but she just chooses to ignore it and have sex with him anyways because that is totally the right thing to do if someone is acting strangely. 
 This book tries to be like Me Before You and I couldn't stand that book either, so I guess that's another reason I didn't like it. So Adam is dying of a brain tumor, and now she wants to take care of him and act like he's the love of her life even though she's technically still only known him for a day. It was just so cringe-worthy and insane. I didn't feel their chemistry at all. Also, Seth was nothing but sweet to her and her constant attitude towards him really got on my nerves. Like he's a baseball player, he's sweet as fuck and he's patient with her and all her Adam drama bull shit. He's way too good for her.  I skimmed from the halfway point to the end because I honestly couldn't give two shits about Charlotte and her dramatic life, so I skimmed to the end and I was not shocked to see the story line just get even worse towards the end. She marries Adam and he dies, and then she goes back and marries Seth, like wtf? Seth deserves better than that bull shit.  
 It fucking sucks because this was one of my most highly anticipated books this year and Renee Carlino is one of my favorites, but this book was a fucking mess. I could not stand any of these characters, especially Charlotte.

I've recently been getting into graphic novels, last month I read all 24 volumes of The Walking Dead and I've been desperate to find another good graphic novel series since. I think this might be my new favorite! This story is so cute. It's about this guy named Alex who lives in a world where Prime Inc. runs the world with their cars, phones, and androids. They have created androids that look like real human beings and people can purchase them all around the world and use them for whatever they like. I think this is a really cool concept and I've always been intrigued by stories that involve artificial intelligence. It reminds me of the movie ""Her"" when the main character falls in love with his computer that can talk to him like a real human being, but in this graphic novel, it is an actual physical android, not just a voice. Recently though, the company Nexaware created androids that are aware and they have opinions and emotions like human beings and the androids attacked. So now there's a risk to owning an android because you don't know if it's going to become aware and try to harm you. 
 Alex isn't interested in owning an android but his Grandma thinks he needs a girlfriend, so she sends him one anyway, and he has mixed feelings about it. I thought this volume seemed really short and I just want more! I like Alex as a main character I think he's smart and caring and he really does want her because he's lonely. And Ada is such an interesting character!

2472,15797848,3,"""There are things I really enjoyed about this book, and a lot of things I didn't enjoy. So, I'm super bummed I didn't love this book, considering I've been waiting for this book to come out for years and it's been on my most highly anticipated releases list for so long! This book sounds amazing to me: a young adult version of Scream, where teens are getting killed off one by one by a serial killer with a knife! It sounded so exciting, and sometimes it was, but most times it was not. 
 Before I say what I didn't like, I want to point out a few things I did like: 1) The diversity. The main character of this book, Makani, is an African-American who is also Hawaiin. That is extremely unique and I've never read about a character with that particular ethnicity, so I appreciate the representation! Also, there is a transgender character in this book, which is something I wasn't expecting and was surprised by so yay diversity!! 2) The first few scenes with the killer were actually really creepy and I loved them. One of the biggest let-downs about this book is that it ends up being more contemporary romance and not as much horror as I thought there should've been, but those first few scenes with the killer gave me goosebumps, they were so good and everything I wanted from this book. Especially the one in the locker room, that one really stood out to me and was so creepy and intense. The horror is done well in this book, even though there's so little of it unfortunately. 3) It's a fast-paced read, and I finished it in one sitting I can't deny that Stephanie Perkins has written an un-put-downable story here. I couldn't take me eyes off the pages, and I had to get to the end right away, so that's always a good sign I think. I had a fun time reading this book, but unfortunately I did have some huge issues with it, which leads me to... 
 Things I didn't like about this book: 1) THE ROMANCE. I know this is a Stephanie Perkins novel so I expected some romance, but damn, there is more romance in this book than there is horror unfortunately, and the worst part is that it's obnoxious teen romance where they just make out all the time and have no chemistry. So that really sucked. I didn't like the romance at all, the romance is between our main character Makani and Oliver, this guy she's been having sex with over the summer but they never talk...? And now that the school year is starting again they start talking and dating and yeah. He's the local tortured loner bad boy with pink hair and it was all just so cliche and idk I wasn't digging the romance and there was a lot of it. 2) We find out who the killer is halfway through it Around the halfway mark the author reveals who the killer is and it kind of killed the mystery and the hype for the rest of the story for me. I thought it should've been kept a secret until the end and I would've enjoyed the mystery a lot more. 3) Makani's ""dark past"" that she's so worried about her friends finding out is actually fucking ridiculous and lame. The whole book Makani is teasing the reader with lines like: ""omg no they're going to find out about my dark past!!1!!1"" and it builds a lot of suspense and then when you finally realize what she did in her past, it was so incredibly lame and just.... really? All she fucking did was cut her best friend's hair off... that's it? Lol so much drama over nothing. 4) The ending was so lame and anti-climatic and cringe-y. I did not care for the last 30-ish pages of this book. It was so cringe-y and just bad, I obviously can't say anything more about it without spoiling it so that's all I'm gonna say. The scenes where they are all chasing David through the corn fields and tackling him and they're all getting stabbed, I was just laughing and rolling my eyes over how ridiculous that all seemed. Like you're telling me this huge group of teens (5-6 people) are having difficulty fighting this one guy?? Idk, I just thought it was cheesy as hell. And then the story just ends with them in the ambulance and it's just like okay story over... Idk I needed more closure than that. 5) The ""reason"" why the killer killed those teens specifically Again, at the end it's revealed why the killer targeted specific teens and it's just... so lame. It's so fucking lame. I wanted something more intense than that. 
 Overall, this book had some really great moments, but it disappointed me. The romance was lame, Makani's huge dark secret from her past was lame, the ending was lame, but some of those first scenes with the killer were so promising and this story had a lot of potential. It's still a fun October read if you're looking for something romantic with a few creepy scenes.""",2015-09-25 23:05:59,There's Someone Inside Your House,young-adult;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fiction,Stephanie Perkins

 I really enjoyed Premonition series and Iniquity is my one of the 2015 can't wait release books. Sadly, it didn't live my expectation up. I'm Team Reed but I feel he lost his usual charm in this book. Reed is a Power Angel, he's supposed to be the strongest man among the others to protect Evie.

2474,20768868,4,"""4.0 out of 5 stars - Dr. Kay Scarpetta is on the trail of a serial sniper who kills targets from incredible distance. She and her husband, FBI profiler Benton Wesley, join Pete Marino and Kay's niece, Lucy, to find this killer in a difficult case that has them perplexed. None of the victims are connected and there's not much evidence at the scene -- except for some copper fragments. 
 Since 1990, after I'd read her first book -- POSTMORTEM -- I've been a fan of Kay Scarpetta. I must say that the author has had her hits and misses as the series evolved over time and this one, #22, still has the science and forensic investigation that I've come to appreciate through the years. To me, Patricia Cornwell represents the genre -- well before I ""knew"" Temperance Brennan (BONES), I was in thrall to this type of crime fiction. I wanted to BE Kay and live her life. Then came all the personal drama, much of which I could have done without, because truly I don't really like all that -- I just want the crime(s), the science, and the closure of the case! I don't care about Benton or Lucy (sick to death of Lucy) or all their secretiveness -- just get on with whodunit and why. I like the medical details and all the interesting facts that Cornwell describes (sometimes too much information) in each book. I get impatient with all the relationship and personal issues. I don't care about what Kay is cooking. I understand that facts don't necessarily make a ""story"" but all Kay's dithering and self examination don't necessarily ramp up the suspense. Her books are full of action, and Kay definitely has lots of talent and skill in MANY areas, and I still tremendously enjoy the descriptions of the job of medical examiner. 
 I'll keep reading this series as long as Cornwell writes it. I hope future books will focus less on Kay and her messed up personal life and more on the cases. I did hate that this one ended in a cliffhanger...

2481,19398490,5,"""This was a lovely, well-written book about 2 young people growing up during World War II. Marie Laure is a french girl that loses her sight at a very young age. She and her father live together in Paris until the war forces them to flee to her great-uncle's home in Saint-Malo. Werner is a young German boy who lives with his sister in an orphan home. He is very smart and interested in learning and it is these traits that will get him picked out from the other children to train to be a Nazi. 
 This book had really wonderful characters. Marie Laure is sweet and curious and I loved her story and seeing things from her perspective. Just as interesting though is Werner's story as we get to see how this nice young man gets to be part of the Nazi army. I thought the author did a fantastic job letting us get to know these characters and helping us to understand the choices that they made. 
 The story itself is not always very fast paced as a lot of it is simply seeing how these two live their lives day to day but this worked really well as I wanted to learn more about these characters and how their lives worked. The writing is excellent and I was easily able to pictures these characters and the lives they live. 
 Overall, this was an excellent book and I would highly recommend it to someone looking for a historical fiction book based on this time period. There are definitely sad moments to the book but nothing too graphic so it would be an excellent book for even young teens to read.

 I am very drawn to character driven stories and have to be able to if not like, at least relate to a character to enjoy a book. I liked Kvothe a lot. He is an interesting, multi-dimensional character. He doesn't always make the right decisions and has to face the consequences of his actions. He is also very realistic about his positive and negative aspects and continues to grow and change throughout the book. All of his characteristics make him feel very real. 
 The plot flowed well and kept me wanting to read more. I was never bored while reading this book. The author is just descriptive enough so you can picture the world around Kvothe but you don't feel overwhelmed or bored with detail. The magic system is interesting so far and I am excited to learn more about it and how it works. 
 This is exactly the type of fantasy book I love and I am excited to start the second book even though I will still have to wait for the third book to come out.

 If I could give this book more than 5 stars I certainly would. 
 This series is certainly my favorite. All the emotions and excitement felt like one hell of a roller coaster ride while reading this! I absolutely applaud Neal Shusterman for writing such an incredible piece of literature. Every paragraph invokes a vivid imagery of every scene that just makes everything seem so realistic. I love how all the characters developed throughout the books and how their stories all came together to form one big picture. The story starts with bits and pieces kind of like weaving, each yarn or thread shows shows a small, somehow insignificant story. But as each strand of yarn continues to be intertwined with the other strands, you start to see the whole picture, everything just comes together perfectly. 
 The characters were very realistic and by that I mean as realistic as one can be in a dystopian book . They weren't the typical teenage hero with a pure heart made of gold who'll bust in the bad guy's building and save the day with their best of friends. I'm talking about a person who plays both the hero and the villain in order to survive. Every character has their own story to share and I absolutely fell in love with every single one (Yes, even Mason Starkey and probably Argent too). Even individuals who are not the main character - the common people has their own story, the civilian/accountant/surgeon/parent/AWOL and it is just amazing. 
 So to wrap everything up, this is a magnificent book.

 Noah writes this in a very natural, talkative tone, which at times I found slightly irritating, crass, or rude (some swearing seemed unnecessary, not to mention the slanginess - I think this book would have still been highly readable without it), but for the most part I think it worked. It made me feel closer to the writer and the story. 
 I particularly loved the early parts of the book, which had a lot of information on the linguistic diversity of South Africa, plenty of dialogue written out it a non-English language (and then translated in the narrative) and early adventures and misadventures experiences by Noah in the realm of language. The earliest pages also had a lot of casual background information on Apartheid and South African politics - no way near enough to make me think I knew anything, but enough to pique my curiosity, and understand the various situations presented in the book. 
 Parts of the book were just very funny. The main body of the book is just full of anecdotes and stories from Noah's childhood and young adulthood, and great fun to read about. 
 Noah did an interesting thing with the organization of the book: he talked about the world he was born into, and his specific situation, with some seriousness. Then he got into the generally funny part. He told the rest of the story of his life through his early twenties in chronological order. And then, once he was caught up, he went back to the beginning to tell the story of his abusive stepfather, going back to his younger years when the stepdad first showed up, and told that story with a level of gravity that had not been present throughout most of the book. I wasn't sure what I thought of this tactic, but in retrospect I think it worked out all right. As a comedian it seems Noah wanted to tell his story a certain way, and by using this structure he was able to do that, and still managed not to leave anything out.

2493,4954833,4,"""In the last two years or so, I have gotten a lot better about selecting the kind of books I like. In general I try not to limit my reading habits, but as I have gotten older and been reading more, and had a longer period of post-college time in which to explore my non-required reading options, I have gotten better at reading things because I want to read them, and not simply because I think I should. 
 I still try to read some of the big titles, but often I don't like those -- see my review of The Empathy Exams, for example, or Middlesex. For the most part, I prefer to wait a year or two to read big titles, to see if they've held up, and let friends and family get to the book first, so I can check my reading network's reviews and reactions to help me decide if it seems like something I'd enjoy, or, if I'm not taking away simple and pure enjoyment, than hopefully I'm taking away insight or experience. 
 I am becoming more aware of this because I have been consistently reading books I like. I find myself being less critical specifically because I think there is less to criticize. It is the best kind of indulgence: finally knowing the basic type of novel that I'll enjoy, and avoiding the Freedoms of the world, because I know they will drive me insane. 
 Books like Brooklyn are my reward. Books like Brooklyn are what make me realize that I know myself better than I used to, that I can trust my judgment, and that I can read for both pleasure and edification. 
 What I loved about Brooklyn was the slow burn of it: easy start, slowly letting you into the characters' lives, showing the setting and the situation in which we find the Lacey family, and how that setting seeps into each of the characters' personalities. And then it picked up -- by the time I got to page 80 I didn't want to put it down. It wasn't a case of what's-going-to-happen-next so much as what-is-this-book-going-to-be. I had the feeling I wouldn't know what to make of it until I had the whole picture, and at the same time I was enjoying the experience of reading. The writing also kept me engaged: Toibin doesn't mess around. His words are descriptive and creative, but his sentences are short and to the point. 
 Unfortunately for me, I saw the movie before I read the book. Normally I don't worry too much about this, and I didn't mind that I already knew the basic plot lines and narrative surprises. But I found the book to be much more subtle than the movie. The movie really seemed to me to be a specific reading of the book, and I wished I had read the book first, so that I had experienced my own interpretation of it, and then saw the movie, to see another interpretation. On the other hand, I think the movie made me love the book even more -- because I really, really loved the movie.

 This sequel was unexpected in its intensity, especially toward the end, and it shows just how far Vhalla has come as not only a sorceress, but as a woman: brave, strong, and unrelenting. 
 As this is a sequel, there may be spoilers. 
 This book destroyed me. My emotions felt like they were just on a roller coaster that wouldn't stick on a straight path most of the way through. Oh man. 
 As far as the plot went, I really enjoy how it keeps advancing to a common goal and a main purpose of Vhalla having to fight for the crown and to hopefully win her freedom. Throughout the events that happen in this book, that never changed, but it was always met with one challenging opposition or another. I'm rooting for Aldrik and Vhalla, and to see their love grow and blossom, only to be torn down, hurts. Challenge after challenge got in their way, and even though they both fought for each other in their own ways to strive toward an end together, things became so rocky in the end that I could feel my heart pounding as I read it all unfolding before me. 
 I found that there were secrets and many twists and turns in this novel. Vhalla is becoming a much stronger individual even in the face of death surrounding her. She doesn't give up and she strives to protect the prince she loves. I think that although that is her primary driving force, she does so with so much passion that it's hard not to root for her and to hopefully see her through to the end. She's much more bold in the presence of the Emperor (whom I wouldn't mind seeing NOT in a place of power, thanks), never backing down and asserting her intelligence among people who would otherwise belittle her. 
 I thought that Vhalla was a force to be reckoned with in this book as we saw her use her magic many, many times than in the previous two books, and how far her training has brought her. She's unafraid to hurt and kill if the need be, which is extremely useful in a solider. I loved being able to see her use her strength and power to her advantage because it really shows how far she's grown from a meek library apprentice, to a stubborn, strong headed, Windwalker. 
 Aldrik was also someone that I worried about at the beginning, but once he recovered from injuries at the beginning, I was glad to see his protective and loving nature over Vhalla come back right away. At times I thought he was too overprotective, much in the same way he was in the previous books, but I saw that his love came from somewhere deep inside of him and he wanted to express that. We also got to see more of his epic fire wielding skills as he fought alongside Vhalla and WOW, those two are incredible together. I thought that mentioning how they fight stronger and better together was an important aspect of the book, for sure, because they bounced off of each other so naturally. 
 As for some of the other characters and side things going on, I thought that Daniel was a good constant companion, though I could see something brewing between them momentarily, Vhalla seemed to quickly shut it down. Elecia and Fritz are in this as much as I would have wanted, but still seeing their presence there, and the interactions they have with Vhalla, really comforted me that friendships weren't just cast to the side in way of the romance. 
 Speaking of the romance, OH MAN. Things got hot and heavy up in here and I was just like, ""YES. FINALLY."" Yup, no shame. 
 But let me just say: that ending, man. I am a ball of angry emotions because WHY CAN'T THEY CATCH A BREAK. WHY. I mean, I knew the Emperor would find some way to twist and turn everything around and make things miserable for them, but ARGH. I'm so mad. I mean, that's not an entirely bad thing, but wow, so many emotions. I need the fourth book now, thanks. 
 There were a few problems I did have with the novel, though, and they mainly had to do with the formatting of the book. I don't know what happened, but on the Kindle it read weirdly and didn't separate paragraphs at times or separated them in chunks. It was strange and distracted from reading because I oftentimes didn't know who was speaking when sentences would run into each other in the same paragraph. 
 Also, there were a lot of typos that I noticed, too, as with the other books. That became distracting, too, but I easily chugged forward. 
 Other than that, I really enjoyed this sequel. It was heart pounding, action based, very romantic, and a whirlwind of emotions (see what I did there?). I'm definitely excited for the next book and I can't wait to read it. 
 Overall, I thought this was a solid sequel and I highly recommend it to anyone who's read the first two novels.""",2016-02-17 18:52:26,"Earth's End (Air Awakens, #3)",fantasy;paranormal;young-adult;romance;fiction,Elise Kova

 The main character Alex is immediately likable and relatable. The relationship between Alex and Ada is a slow burn and the narrative is steady but never feels slow or boring. Instead, I found myself totally engrossed and sad every time I came to the last page, it always left me waiting more.

 This was my second reading, and should I live another 10 years on this planet, not my last. I have so many, many, many feelings on this book, and there is no way to convey them all in one post, but I am going to just give a quick barrage of feelings for the sake of sentiment. This was my 2016 feels, probably different from my 2014 feels, and will probably be different from my 2020 feels. 
 Kvothe is the stuff of legends, the kingkiller, the actor, the theif, the hero, the student...but he is also a giant fuck up, and honestly, that's what makes him special to me. I once read a review for this book that was like -le sigh- I just hate those fantasy stories where the hero is flawless in every way. I was actually embarrassed for the writer of that review. You either did not read the same book I did, you did not pay attention, or worse, you read three chapters and decided you knew the character before you met him. 
 Kvothe goes back and fourth between hilariously rich, and fishing-from-the-trash broke. He's rash, he's risky, and not with good odds! Like, his life is not a portrayal of 'high risk, high reward' and how that pays off, his life is a portrayal of 'The house always wins.' He happens to have some incredibly dumb luck, and that's when he's most successful - which I think is true in our day to day lives. 
 Pat Rothfus is like a classical composer with words. His language is so fluid, and peaceful, and bold, and engaging. I honestly am falling short of how good he is, I don't think I have the words to describe his words. He's just fantastic, he could write three paragraphs about a man crumpling up a piece of paper, and I would be enthralled. 
 I love (and sometimes hate but mostly love) Denna. I love her complexity, and simplicity. I think we as readers make her bigger in our minds with very little information, because we've all known someone who seems so much bigger to us than anyone else, and Pat uses the language to reach into our memories and draw that person out and project them onto Denna. We all have had or still have a Denna. Or maybe we've even been Denna. This relationship was just incredibly fun and interesting to experience. 
 I love Devy. She's great. I wish she had more page time, but I'm crossing my fingers for later. She's a friend in a low place - possibly criminal, but she's clever, ethical, and efficient. She needs her own book. Love Auri. Can't wait to read her book. She seems like a small nod to Luna Lovegood. Brilliant. Batty. Lovely. Wise. 
 The villains: Another great gem in this story, is that sometimes the villain, like in life, is just circumstance. Sometimes it's a giant tool that WILL NOT get out of your way for FIVE minutes (Ambrose). Sometimes its a lack of closure, a mystery, something you can't seem to fight (The Chandrian). Sometimes its yourself. This series has a lot of explaining to do in the way of its villains, and I'm only happy to wait it out, and enjoy the ride. 
 Lastly, I love this book's magic. It's dressed up with science and believable enough for me to crave it in day-to-day life. I wish I could lower myself into The Heart of Stone. I wish I could split my mind in two, keep a secret from myself or debate a riddle between two of my own selves. I wish I could use like items to create a connection, and manipulation. This subtle writing of mysticism might be the book's greatest success. It was surreal enough to be enchanting, but structured enough to be fascinating. 
 I just started Wise Man's Fear. I went out and bought it the same week I finished Name of the Wind in 2014, but I held off on reading it. Mostly because I knew if I was going to binge the series without a third book, it was going to hurt. And given that the third book is taking its time (no complaints from me unless I die suddenly and unexpectedly, and in that case, Pat Rothfus will get such a haunting) this was a good move. Sometimes, if I was having a shit day, I would take it off the shelf and think, ""At least I get to read Wise Man's Fear for the first time, eventually."" Well, given that I'm about to take on The Dark Tower Series, it seemed right. You know when it's time to read a book that's been seasoning on a shelf for a while. You just know, and if I was going to take on Dark Tower, I was going to kick off that marathon of fantasy reading by starting with The KingKiller Chronicles. 
 I've gone on longer than I've meant to, and probably haven't even scratched the surface of how this story has reached into my soul and warmed it, like a hot chocolate on a cold day. Characters haven't stuck with me so completely since Joss Whedon's Firefly. I learn something new every time I read it, and I honestly, even now, I look forward to a third visit to The Name of the Wind.""",2013-12-25 17:42:38,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 The author had me hook, line, and sinker. I love the fast paced feel of the book. You don't once have the feeling that the story is being dragged out. The characters go through emotions that are realistic. You find yourself tapping into the raw anger that surfaces for Eve from their past relationship. You are right there with her telling her to stand her ground and keep Gage at a distance. Then just a bit later you are rooting for Gage when he is slowly showing his true feelings for Eve and his past regrets. Now you are rooting for him and saying never mind just let your guard down and give it up girl. 
 Eve and Gage's story is filled with attraction and a broken past. If being drawn to someone you are trying to keep feelings buried for isn't enough to get your blood pumping, there is always running from the flesh-eating zombies. 
 If you are looking for a great romance story with an apocalyptic feel then look no further. This is a great book. Especially if you are in the market to read something new and looking to ease into the genre. It's mild enough not to make you squirm. At least not from thoughts of blood and guts.

Bathsheba is the office manager, while Sara follows up with clients and makes sure all dates go according to plan. While Bathsheba is a human, Sara was attacked six years ago by a werewolf, which infected her. After Bathsheba killed the man who changed her sister, Sara has no desire whatsoever to go live with the werewolf pack, which is violent. So, she has been hiding who she is for the past six years. The pack knows there is a female shifter out there and they want her back. Bathsheba has dedicated her life to keeping her sister safe. 
 But things become complicated when head of the Russell clan and cougar-shifter Beau calls up Midnight Liaisons in need of a date. After the woman he was supposed to date through Midnight Liaisons cancels, Beau is in a bind. Bathsheba can't get a hold of her boss and knows if this client doesn't get satisfaction, things could go south for her job quickly. Although it is against rules for humans to date paranormals, Bathsheba offers to go out on a date with Beau as long as everyone keeps it a secret. 
 But after she meets the very attractive were-cougar, she is going to find it much more difficult to go on only one date. When a very scary, unknown type of shifter starts hunting her sister, they will need the help of Beau and his clan to fight. 
 Beauty Dates the Beast has a very strong beginning. I immediately liked the heroine, Bathsheba. She is funny, and not perfect, and becomes all flustered when she meets Beau. Her main goal in life is to keep Sara safe, something she is willing to sacrifice everything for. But it all starts to get muddled when she can't shake the attraction to Beau. No matter how much she likes him, though, she refuses to give up Sara's secret to him. One thing I had to question in the beginning is that the shifters have a superior sense of smell. So Sara applies heavy doses of perfume when around other shifters so they don't pick up on her scent. But wouldn't a shifter realize this trick? Wouldn't they figure anyone wearing that much perfume is obviously trying to hide who they are? So that tactic didn't always make sense to me. 
 But the first half of this book is still very strong. We get really nice tension between Beau and Bathsheba. She happens to be a virgin, so she doesn't give up the goods right away. That makes it a little more exciting, because Beau is affected by a nearby cougar who's going into heat, so his sexual appetite is more out of control. Watching him trying to control himself around Bathsheba is amusing. There are some very cute parts in the first half. 
 I think things falter a little in the last third of the book. Beau is the head of the Russell clan, and while we see the growly, dominant side of him in the beginning of the book, it doesn't really come through toward the end. I mean, we are told that all he has to do is snap his fingers and everyone obeys, but we never really see it. I also became frustrated with Bathsheba keeping so many things from Beau (who never gave her a reason to not trust him). And at the end when the big conflict comes to a conclusion, I think Bathsheba runs out into danger without really going through her options. If Beau really does have his entire clan at his beck and call, she should have turned to him - and not taken on things by herself. 
 Overall, though, I enjoyed this one. Beau's second-in-command, Ramsey, who is a were-bear and never has much to say, really intrigues me, and his book is next. And he is a virgin! *ahem* 
 I think Jessica Sims (who also writes as Jill Myles) has a fun, sexy world starting.

Not all werewolves attack, though, and some residents of Hemlock have formed groups in support of werewolf rights. Another group has formed, too--a well-organized vigilante group of werewolf hunters, called the Trackers. 
 Mackenzie's best friend Amy had been killed by a werewolf, and yet Mac doesn't side with the Trackers. She's not entirely sure how she feels about the issue of werewolf rights, but she does feel the Trackers go too far. And then someone close to her turns out to be a werewolf, and Amy's murder is suddenly shown in a new light. Mac finds herself on a quest to uncover the truth. 
 I have to admit, I have a strange fondness for this novel, even though it's not exactly perfect. I gave it four stars because I saw hints of a five-star writer in here, but also found some real three-star shortcomings--shortcomings I recognized as issues I have in my own writing. The author sometimes states the obvious or over-explains, when she needs to give her readers credit for figuring things out on their own--or rather, give herself credit for having ""shown"" us what she turns around and ""tells"" us. She also is quite obviously a plot writer, and therefore some of her characterization takes a hit as she's trying to force the plot to play out the way it ""needs to."" As I said, I recognize this because I'm guilty of the same things ;). 
 But the good parts of her writing also hit home. The complexity of the plot, the way she plants ideas in one chapter to have it resurface unexpectedly later on. The romance in the story is a plot element rather than the main focus, and the mystery takes center stage. The characters are not stereotypes, and they're not all hung up on teen angst, which was refreshing in the YA novel. Sure, they have issues, and the voice is appealing to teens, but it's not that overdone, snarky, self-obsessed voice that seems to be overtaking teen fiction these days. 
 I would have tweaked a few things, like the author's tendency to repeat phrases. And there were a few points at which I thought she made Mac a bit unobservant, places where I didn't quite buy that Mac hadn't figured something out. There is also a lack of rhyme and reason, imho, to the things Mac chooses to lie about and/or keep secret vs. the things she shares. 
 But overall, I thought the story was well-done. The plot has some real surprises and it's totally worth reading through a few irritating quirks. I look forward to seeing what comes next from this author! 
 (Note to publisher--WHY the girl in the formal dress on the cover? Because that's the trend? It has NOTHING to do with the story. PLEASE, dear publishers, STOP making book covers all look the same. I'd have possibly passed this book by because it's yet-a-freaking-nother ""girl in a pretty dress"" cover. But as it came through Amazon Vine and the description is right next to the cover image, the description assured me the story might interest me. Seriously--make the cover match the story. Eesh.)

 Unfortunately, this book just wasn't for me. 
 I really wanted to like it, and it started off promising, but by the end of the book I was just over everything - the heroine, the hero, the threats, the sex (I never thought I'd say that). 
 That always seems to be the case for me when it comes to this authors work - The stories, I just don't feel them, but I can't resist trying again. 
 Thumbs UP 
 The one night stand at the beginning of the book was hot as hell and held a lot of promise for what was to come! I couldn't ever fault this authors talent for writing steamy sex scenes. 
 I appreciated the fact that Six was a cold-hearted killer, that remained a cold-hearted killer. This wasn't an alpha-male that caved to the heroines pleas, and magically switched personalities by the end of the book (though he certainly changed some). 
 In general the storyline was fairly gripping, which is why I didn't stop reading. Despite my many issues, I was entertained. I wanted to know what was going on with Six and his fellow agents, and even though most of them were assholes, I liked reading about the others - especially Five. 
 Thumbs DOWN 
 *Spoilers* 
 I didn't like Six. How could I like a Hero (and I use that term loosely) that abused the heroine through almost the entirety of the story? He had no redeeming features and he constantly reminded Paisley/Lacey that he was going to kill her. He was just an awful person. 
 I lost all respect for Lacey when she started to fall for Six. I mean, how could she possibly develop feelings for a guy she saw murder her entire team of workmates and some of her best friends? He kidnapped her, raped her, treated her like trash and constantly threatened her life. In return for that, she started to like him, and did pathetic things like drop to her knees to help relieve his stress - as if he deserved it! But the final straw for me was when she finally did make a stand against Six, and she struck him... because she realized she'd been missing The Walking Dead since she'd been kidnapped. Really? That is your big concern?! Dumb. Bitch. 
 Too much sex! Shit, I never thought I'd complain about that. But it felt like every chapter there was another sex scene and since I wasn't buying into their weird little duo, I could have done with less. 
 Final Thoughts 
 As I said earlier, I've not had the best run when it comes to this authors work. I think my biggest problem is that the Heroes are just so unlikable to me, and Six was no exception. I was however, never bored. I dare say, I will be back to read more by the author in the future, because despite my issues, her stories always appeal and I always hold out hope that the next time I'll agree with all the rave reviews!""",2016-06-06 22:16:27,Six,romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,K.I.

 You know when you set out to read a book that's based on Romeo and Juliet, that the tale will not be all about love and peace. But god damn, the second half of this book was heartbreaking. My poor little heart couldn't handle the anxiety of worrying about so many bad people at once, and when the blood shed came, it broke me. But that's what made this story so addicting, and good! 
 It's only my second time reading a J.M. Darhower novel, and I tell ya, I feel a new favourite author coming on. Both stories I've read have been gripping, a bit dark, with a forbidden feeling and a lot of passionate love. And what I like is that it's not all predictable. A bit cliche at times, but I can live with that, and the author is aware. Her characters even mention the cliches. 
 I loved the characters, both the main couple and their siblings. Even though they did some dumb things, and weren't altogether 'good' people, knowing the tragedies they'd experienced in their lives, endeared me to them. 
 As the story was winding down, thinking it was a standalone, I was getting pissy. There was still more story to tell! But thankfully I was mistaken, and this is not a standalone story. And those final few lines in the story have me gagging for the next story. I need it. NOW. 
 Kudos for taking on Romeo and Juliet and still surprising me, J.M. Darhower. This story had me crying with all kinds of emotions, and that rarely happens. I am impressed and won't be forgetting this story quickly. Bring on the next book!""",2015-02-16 20:24:22,"By Any Other Name (Forbidden, #1)",romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,J.M. Darhower

2522,64482,3,"""I wanted to like this book, but it never quite hooked me emotionally. At the same time, it was easy to lose myself in it, and a quick, interesting read. A lot of points felt intentionally unresolved, which bugged me some. I felt sorry for all the characters that Clarissa ditched on her literal/metaphorical journey. The sense of place was great, and the characters were often compelling (except, sometimes, Clarissa herself). But the language felt a little too self-consciously almost cute sometimes - cute is not the right word, but the closest I can come. Things like, ""I pulled out two loud-ticking alarm clocks I'd come across when furtively packing, and held one clock up to each ear. All I could hear was time."" Part of me wants to like that, but really only if Clarissa then makes fun of herself for thinking it. Not if she just ends the moment there. 
 Overall, though, I did like it - and I wouldn't discourage anyone from giving it a try if it sounds interesting. I'm just not going to run around raving about it.""",2008-03-17 10:59:09,Let the Northern Lights Erase Your Name,fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Vendela Vida

 I received this book free from the Author through Goodreads group [Shut Up And Read] {Read It & Reap} for my honest review

 5 Stars!!!! 
 What a story. It's not very often I read straight up romantic fiction, but, hell this was phenomenal! Once I started I couldn't but it down. ( Even on the bus, and I get sick when I read on the bus.) 
 At times I did want to crack some heads, just to knock some sense into both of them. It was like watching a very awkward dance, one involving a lot if missed timings and stepped on toes. Ducks, they where baby ducks. 
 The scars on both their hearts ( body) had my heart feels ripped to pieces and my head spinning. No one should have to go through what these two did. Having to pick up the pieces of a shattered life and start over, while tying to keep some type of sanity, messy. No wonder they bounced off one another like opposite magnets. To many glass walls, to much to lose. 
 I highly recommend this novel. It isn't just another one of your typical romantic fiction, it's so much more than that. The only way to truly understand, is to pick up this book and read it yourself.

2527,17950614,5,"""THIS SERIES IS THE GREATEST WORK OF LITERATURE I HAVE EVER READ!! Neal Shusterman you are a GENIUS! A FUCKING GENIUS!! 
 The Unwind Dystology is definitely the best dystopian series I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It is extraordinary, superb, and thought-provoking. From the very first words of the first book up to the last, it's a roller coaster of emotions that is so beautiful and mesmerizing yet still being able to be horrifying and tragic. The series is full of tragedy, drama, love, misfortunes, despair, and hope that brought up so much tears too many times. 
 The books are complex, filled with multiple POVs so you'd get to experience the story on both sides. That's the thing about Shusterman, he is never bias and always put a fair contrast to each side. The world he has created here is so intricate and brilliant that it makes you think the idea of Unwinding could be a plausible reality in the far off future. He even placed official sites that backs up on human organs being sold in black markets. My God I hope not!! 
 It's difficult to end a series when you've gotten to love it so much that it actually hurts. This series I love so much that I will forever remember it and take with me the lessons that I've learned. The characters, all of them I have learned to love (even the bad guys), will stay in my heart where they will rewind all the cuts that they have left in my poor, broken heart. Because that's what you will surely become when you read this series; divided, unwhole, unwound. 
 But don't worry because when you get to the end, you'll feel whole again, even if there may be holes and spaces in some places. As the one and only Camus Comprix said, just take it ""Bit by bit, and not alone."" 
 This is me signing off. Stay sane. and stay whole.

2528,8262550,4,"""I can not believe how much I loved this book. I mean REALLY loved it. I have had it on my Kindle since October but have pushed off reading it as the cover is a little cheesy, and some of the reviews implied it was very amateurish. 
 Eyes..is old school in the sense that is an old-fashioned romance with a capital R. No silly quirks, no gimmicks, no BDSM (not that I'm opposed to it), but just a story of the subtle and sweet development of love between two fun and honorable characters. Very character driven. I read until 2:00 a.m. to finish it. 
 Anne is an awesome heroine. Honorable, feisty, loving sweet and very funny: example she goes to church just to glare down the wimpy preacher, and has no problems running off her new husband's obnoxious alpha big brother. 
 And, Cord. Oh my. I am a sucker for the tortured hero as long as they are not too Heathcliff. Cord is half Indian and has been shunned by the community as well as his family to a certain extent. To say he is a man of few words is putting it mildly, but the author did a great job of showing his struggles and his love for Anne without making him sound like a wimp. 
 It's not a perfect book. I wanted to strangle some of the secondary characters, primarily his half-brothers. Frank, I'm gunning for you, you SOB, and her father needs to die a slow, agonizing death. No insta forgiveness from Anne. 
 A lot of the story deals with the fact that Cord is part Indian and the incredible prejudice against him and Anne as his wife. In 2016 it's easy to dismiss how harsh life could be. I thought the author did an excellent job showing how tough it was even with family and legal support. 
 I hate reviews that are as long as the book, and mine is getting into dangerous territory. 
 Bottom line: if you like a true romance, multi-dimensional characters, steamy romance scenes with minimal graphics (insert tab a into slot b), a decent plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat the give Eyes a try. If you're not hooked by the third chapter then you're done.""",2016-01-27 05:58:21,"Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold (Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold, #1)",history;historical fiction;biography;romance;fiction,Ellen O'Connell
2529,6470269,4,"""A novel that manages to be both epic and claustrophobic as the town of Chester's Mill is enclosed by the mysterious dome during the weeks leading up to Halloween. Various children have seizures and utter warnings about 'The Great Pumpkin' and 'pink stars' and what is already an inexplicable situation becomes even stranger. 
 King states in his Author's Notes that he had the idea for this novel in 1976 and that may account for why it has the feel of his early works. It isn't as far reaching in its scope or philosophy as 'The Stand' but still managed to impress and entertain me. King has a distinctive style of writing; very down to earth and gritty even when fantastical events are taking place. There are a lot of characters, though the majority made just brief appearances. Still, it was hard sometimes to keep track of who was who in the smaller roles and I was thankful for the list of characters in the opening pages as well as the map. 
 Under the Dome had been on my TBR mountain since its publication as I was somewhat daunted by its size. I wanted to begin it before the TV adaptation started being shown in the UK. However, it was obvious from the opening scenes that the writers of the TV series were taking a different direction for characters and events than the source novel. I then read that King confirmed this including that the source of the dome would be different and a longer time line. Oh well, I was still grateful that the TV series finally inspired me to tackle this monster of a novel as I enjoyed it a great deal. 
 The Stephen King inspired TV series 'Haven' also did have a Christmas episode that featured the town of Haven being enclosed by a dome with similar initial events to the novel including people being cut in half (ick!) and car crashes.

I will say this, I mostly read YA books more for the characters not the story so Dante is what really did it in for me (as you can so plainly see). The story itself was probably more of a 4. It was good; kept me interested. And premise was different than the YA books I've read, especially the female main character. I definitely appreciated the different view of the demon/angel thing and the relationship thing.

 Kept from You is the fourth book in the Tear Asunder Series. Although you can read it as a stand-alone, I highly recommend you read the entire series from the beginning. The characters are deeply rooted in their relationships with each other, and the story arc is carefully constructed to overlap over the whole series. With each book in the series, I have fallen more in love with these characters and the world in which they dwell. To finally experience Killian Kane ""aka Kite"" was beyond perfection. 
 ""Sexy. Flushed. Beautiful. Rare. That is what she was."" 
 Savvy is beautiful inside and out. A talented dancer she has had to overcome a great loss. Living in her broken little world, she meets Killian. Although he seems hard and cold, she discovers a kindness in him. A spark is set, and although the circumstances are less than ideal, Killian and Savvy form a bond. When disaster strikes and they are torn apart. Both believe they will never see each other again. 
 ""Open your legs for me, Savy. I'm going to fuck that pussy until I hear you scream my name again."" 
 Years later, Killian is thriving as the drummer for the hit band Tear Asunder. He never forgot Savvy and is shocked when she shows up backstage after one of his concerts. Savvy is looking for help from Killian, and although he would do anything for her, the help she needs is out of the question! As Killian and Savvy reconnect, the old flame ignites, and the two are brought together again. However, Killian is quite broken and must allow himself to be loved before they can move forward together. As the demons of their past threaten their blossoming romance, Savvy and Killian must cling to one another and find a way to battle the darkness together. 
 Told in dual POV, Kept from You is sexy, tender, raw, and beautifully broken. The characters are complex, and their life experiences make their stories that much more beautiful. The transformation that Killian makes throughout is heartbreaking, and yet, Savvy offers Killian the healing that he needs to find peace. The secondary characters continue to shape and mold the story with their relationships and circumstances. Loyalty and unwavering love continue to drive the action in this series, and each and every piece of the plot is weaved together with absolute perfection. The passion that exists between Killian and Savvy is fiery and thoroughly explored and the action is intense as the plot continues to unfold. 
 Overall, Kept from You is an absolute must read. The complex characters, non-stop action, tender relationships, and fiery passion make this second chance romance another blockbuster hit from Nashoda Rose! I simply adore this series! Each and every character is diverse, and yet, together they are complete. When it comes to the Tear Asunder Series, I will simply never get enough!

2546,28963772,4,"""*I gave this audiobook an A/A- for the Narration and B for the Story at AudioGals* 
 This is a tough review to write. There were things about this book that I loved, but one major and one minor building block of this relationship that didn't sit well with me. Unfortunately, the blurb doesn't flush out most of this story (instead just giving you a glimpse of these characters at a point in time) and I don't want to give away too much and ruin the development of the story for you, so I will have to dance around what I didn't like without giving away too many details. This also means that I will not provide a traditional background factual recitation for this story for fear of giving too much away. 
 First, what I loved. The narration was simply top-notch! Kate Russell blew it out of the park with her range in voices, as well as her emotional, inspiring, and well attuned delivery. You get a good sense of the heroine's perspective from Ms. Russell's delivery. Not only does she clearly tell her story, but she also does it in an empathetic fashion that makes you root for the heroine to find her HEA. 
 Sebastian York 's narration also works incredibly well in this story. Mr. York's narration time, although much shorter than Ms. Russell's, was the perfect accentuation of the hero's point of view. He nailed what I pictured in my head for this hero's voice, and given the incredibly hot nature of this story, he did a fantastic job with those passages as well. 
 Another aspect that I enjoyed about this story is that it ended up being more complex than I was expecting. With both the hero's and heroine's backstories featuring prominently in the stumbling blocks towards, and the development of, their relationship (but not being described in the blurb), it is no surprise that a large part of this romance is in facts unfolding as the characters get to know each other, as well as their own individual wants and desires in a relationship. There is also another serious theme mixed in which I wasn't expecting and that challenged my acceptance of another circumstance in the story that I normally would have outright rejected. Some of my favorite romances are those that cause the listener to have to think outside of the box, and J. Daniel's certainly hit that cord with me in Four Letter Word. 
 However, the hero holds back one serious fact about himself when he first starts his physical relationship with the heroine. . . .

2550,186074,4,"""It's like everyone tells a story about themselves inside their own head. Always. All the time. That story makes you what you are. We build ourselves out of that story."" 
 I had been procrastinating reading this book for the longest time because I generally tend to shy away from books with such high acclaim and praise fearing I'll be disappointed. 
 Well I wasn't extremely disappointed but I was equally not 100% on the crazy hype train. 
 The pros of the story are that Patrick Rothfuss is amazing at story telling. You get sucked in to Kvothe's life story so easily and the jump from one story to the next is fluid and seamless. 
 -->I also really love the magic system. More often than not fantasy books have become lazy at explaining magic. Its either you can do it if you were born with the ""gift"" and its often messy and lacks borders and shapes. The system in The Name of the Wind is well sort out and explained with different forms and the way its taught is quite practical and reasonable and highly enjoyable to follow. 
 -->The characters were fantastic and fleshed out in ways that made them quite memorable and showed the impact that they had on young Kvothe's life. 
 The cons of the story are that even though I like the magic system its not quite as fantastical as I would have hoped. Majority of the book was quite practical and mundane filled with the drudgery of everyday life such as University classes, the search of money and what have you. Granted I know that this is part of Kvothe's journey but must we emphasize it so much. 
 -->Also the story at particular points just felt like it was dragging along. Some parts I felt were unnecessary and could have been said in passing. Then towards the end he just moves along quite fast which is quite jarring considering the pace of the entire book. 
 -->As much as I like Kvothe are you seriously trying to tell me that there is nothing this kid can do. He got into the Arcanum in like what a month when it takes other student at least two years. He's a master musician, great artificer, great at the Medica (this I take particular offense to as I devote all of my time to study medicine and I still don't get parts of it and he does while doing 100 other things) a masterful actor and it goes on and on and on. Yes he works hard and yes I know savants exist but those characters in real life have a huge deficit elsewhere. They are either extremely socially awkward, depressed and have all manner of issues to boot. But Kvothe has none of that. Other than the fact that he's dirt poor and has a habit of not getting hints from interested females there is really nothing extremely flawed about him making him lose he's mystique. Of course he''l get his pipes, of course he'll be promoted to Re'lar, of course he'll get into the Arcanum because he's just that good. This is a nerd fantasy if I've ever seen one and its just annoying. 
 Overall I liked The Name of the Wind. It has an interesting plot, great characters and good magic system. Hopefully The Wise Man's Fear will move along faster and contain a lot more magic and adventure. This book is a 85% 
 P.S I love the University but we need to leave there soon its starting to bore me and have terrible similarities to my own experience and honestly I just want to escape""",2016-09-30 09:43:39,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

Toibin's writing is so evocative for setting, and for characterization it's quiet and understated in a way that seems fitting for the kind of character Eilis is. However, there was a strange narrative distance from her at times (especially in the last third or so of the book) that's hard to explain. It was difficult to tell how much she actually cared for people, because she can seem so detached- I found her to be very similar to Therese from The Price of Salt in this way. It was also frustrating how infrequently she as a character seemed to make decisions for herself, instead of following the suggestions or ideas of others.

 The worldbuilding in Alex + Ada, Vol. 1 is great. In addition to setting the tone for the story really well, the first few pages establish most of what you need to know about what seems to be a near-future world- there are sentient robots, there was a (contained) violent AI uprising, AI is pretty fully incorporated into most peoples' lives. 
 While the story itself isn't necessarily groundbreaking, it is compelling. The beginning is so strong- I felt that the writer/artist portrayed depression and how it can be so cyclical really well. I also liked both Alex and Ada as characters (and some of the minor characters like Franklin)- they definitely have room to grow, but I want to read more about both of them.

2568,28963772,2,"""I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review. 
 Married right out of highschool, Sydney thought she had her happily ever after wrapped up but after being blindsided by her husband, even though the writing was on the wall, she gets a chance to find herself again. A chance aided by a mistaken identity and a wrong phone number. 
 Being woken up and cursed out by a strange woman somehow ends up being the best thing that could have happened to Brian. Drowning in guilt after an accident and just going through the motions in life, his late night conversations with the mystery woman are helping him live again. 
 After all their painful experiences, Sydney and Brian are about to be rewarded by fate. 
 Love was a risk. It was wild and unpredictable. You could either hold on for the ride, not knowing how it would end, or you could let go and never know the amazing you could've had. 
 First in the new Dirty Deeds series, Four Lettered Word, is a steamy New Adult read that incorporates some deep emotional elements. This was a new to me author and I couldn't help noticing how similar her writing style, especially with the hero's dialogue, is to Kristen Ashley. The verbiage and tone with the nicknames (babe) and hero's casual just accept it possessiveness of heroine was definitely reminiscent; this author's sentence structure and syntax is more on point and I think readable. 
 Our first introduction to Sydney is when her husband is telling her he is done with their relationship. We don't get to see the conversation but instead Sydney's thoughts and feelings, this was an incredible emotional way to start the story. The numbness the author was able to convey and then the sudden rushing of emotions hitting Sydney felt real and was powerful. Unfortunately, as the story went on I felt like Sydney started to display an immaturity that wasn't worthy of the first introduction to the character. Brian came off as a calm and cool character, he had a lot going on in regards to what he was dealing with but it worked in and with the framework of the story. The first 40% of the story worked really well for me but after that it started to lose me to redundancy and loss of sense of direction; some scenes could have been cut out. 
 The premise of Sydney and Brian getting to know one another over the phone was a solid one and I liked how they progressed from text messaging to talking but I would have liked to have seen more of those in depth conversations and felt their growing closeness. We're told they talked about their lives for hours but only get more superficial ones. I also thought when they started getting into phone sex that these scenes could have been drawn out more, they felt kind of like wham, bam, thank-you ma'am; felt like a lost opportunity for some great sexual heat and tension. This does read like a New Adult and I often find that they lack the emotion I'm looking for in sexual situations, so this could be a personal taste (going by the numerous reviews praising the hotness of this story, I'm the dissenting voice on this one). 
 One thing I liked about the main and secondary characters was the varied issues they all were dealing with. Brian's friends and Sydney's friends are all obviously being set-up for their own books and each was interesting in their own way. I do have to say though, that the introduction to Brian's friend Jamie (who also looks to be the hero in the next book) was extremely off-putting. He is said to have a great attraction to ""untapped pussy"" and in one scene it's joked about how he better check ids and acts like he doesn't care if the girls were underage.  His general actions throughout the story are fine but what I put in spoiler tags does not really endear him to me. The rest of the cast though look to have engaging backgrounds that could keep you locked into the series for a while. 
 I liked the beginning and how our couple got together but thought the rest sagged with the love developing too quickly between our leads and the second half of the story not really having anywhere to go. I think this would have really worked for me in more of a novella format, snappier tempo or if the emotion between our couple could have been given more breadth. However, if you're a fan of Kristen Ashley you'll definitely want to check this one out.""",2016-08-30 19:24:46,"Four Letter Word (Dirty Deeds, #1)",romance;fiction,J.  Daniels
2569,10063343,4,"""A Touch of Crimson is set in a slightly different corner of Day's Marked universe - the former dealt with the Infernal half of the universe and Touch of Crimson deals with the angelic half. 
 Seraphim Adrian is the leader of the warrior band of angels who keep their former brethren the Fallen (vampires) in check. Because of his forbidden love, Adrian has barely skirted the line that would make him Fallen. He has loved Shadoe, the daughter of the leader of the Fallen, Syre, over many of her incarnations. 
 Now Adrian has found her again in Lindsay, a woman who is more than human and who shares his dislike for vampires. However, as has happened over many lifetimes, Shadoe's father also seeks his daughter to free her from the eternal cycle of death and rebirth by turning her into a vampire. And if keeping Lindsay out of Syre's grasp wasn't enough of a challenge, there is trouble in the world that Adrian is tasked to guard: angels are being assassinated, vampires are going rabid and there is unrest in the Lycan population - some feel that they have endured servitude to the angels for far too long. 
 I really enjoyed reading a Touch of Crimson but there were a few things that bugged me a bit. One was that conflict with Syre ended oddly, I even went back and reread the last few chapters to figure out why I had that reaction. What actually cleared this up for me reading the prequel short A Dark Kiss of Rapture, I had found the behavior of leader Syre with respect to Lindsay and Adrian at the end of the story to be sort of weird.  Since Syre and Adrian are at odds throughout the story, I had come away with the impression that the Fallen were bad guys - and the behavior of Sayre's enforcer Vashti - bolstered by Lindsay's conviction and Vash's treatment of one of the 'dogs' - also lead me to the same impression. But having the framework from the short story and knowing now that the Fallen are not the bad guys, despite the uneasy relationship with Adrian and the Seraphim who were their former brethren. Syre, who lost his wings by falling in love with his mortal wife and having children, just really loved his daughter and wanted her free from the endless cycle of reincarnation. So, that love along with the way that the turning ended up playing out, makes returning Lindsay to Adrian at the end make a lot more sense.  ] 
 My other issue was that the big love scene between Adrian and Lindsay was kind of iffy  Okay so she's trying to be good and not lead him to Fall, but she wants him desperately, he restrains her by tying her hands but she manages through her lust to say 'No' twice half heartedly, her attitude during and after are accepting - so is this nonconsentual? Wondering about that during the scene, definitely took me out of the moment.  
 But hero-centric me wasn't totally in love with Adrian anyway, I was bothered by the fact that he was so hypocritical - loving a human, many times over the centuries - when the Fallen that he guards lost their wings for love as well and are cursed with no hope of redemption. I also wasn't keen on Lindsay and Adrian's relationship, there was good chemistry because of the forbidden romance, but but he is bossy and possessive and with Adrian, Lindsay was sort of a very supportive accessory. What I did love though is that Adrian is actually portrayed as a winged being and his wings are transportation, a weapon, an indicator of his mood as well. 
 I liked Lindsay's relationship with Elijah much better. Elijah is a Lycan who is trying really hard not to be the alpha he is - the angels are supposed to be top dog. I didn't want him to be with Lindsay but I really enjoyed their friendship and I really liked Elijah as a character and am happy that the next book A Hunger So Wild has him in the lead, apparently with bad girl Fallen Vashti sharing the spotlight.""",2011-10-09 13:31:23,"A Touch of Crimson (Renegade Angels, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Sylvia Day

 Second star for being mercifully short. 
 Third star for creating such a lonesome atmosphere, which was much scarier than the vampires themselves. (I found this unique in both the book and the movie.) 
 Minus one star for the the majority of the book spent with a whiny, dull drunkard, who spent way too much time trembling and getting the creepy hots for vampire ladies, instead of spending enough time on the meatier stuff, which was crammed into the final pages. 
 Minus another star for mocking people of religion, having trust issues with kidnapee (ya think?), not heeding kidnappee's warning, and being an over-dramatic loser till the end.

2587,18690890,3,"""I like John Green's books because they make teenagers think of grand things like death and infinity. I think his work introduces a lot of people to concepts that they might have never thought so much about. His work makes you stop to think about yourself and the people around you. 
 However I didn't like the first half of this book. It was like standing with a group of people that I really wanted to be a part of, but that I just didn't get. There were all these kinds of inside jokes that didn't appeal to me such as black santa's, Margo's schemes. I had just finished a book that I loved for its silliness, A sea of monsters from the Percy Jackson series, but this was just plain weird. I had all these assumptions about the book, wanting the characters to be a little different. Perhaps that was the paper town I had created before reading it. Frankly, Ben got on my nerves although I learned to like him later on. I just couldn't relate to everthing that happened in the first part and found myself thinking is this it? The story didn't grab me from the start like The Fault In Our Stars did. The characters were still this group of people that I wanted to like because apperentely they were cool, but I just didn't see it. 
 Then came page 199. Now I could relate. I've often thought about how people have different sides than what we see of them. I've often had to tell myself that people with bad intentions have some good in them and the other way around. The realization that not everyone and everything is as we see it and that it differs with every person is still one that is sometimes a little hard to grasp. But it's interesting. I too want to unravel persons and find out their every secret and thoughts. But you can't. Not really. 
 I do like the ending but I found myself wanting to know more about why Margo did the things she did. Again I wanted to unravel all her reasons. I felt like there had to be a bigger reason why she did it all, but when I almost finished it I realized that depression may not always have a big reason. Although there were clues, but I wanted to see more than just that. 
 I guess the good books don't hand you the answers on a silver plate. I don't know if this is a good book. It had some nice elements and thoughts about paper towns and how we see people, but the jokes really don't appeal to me. I had hoped I wouldn't just relate to the parts that were about seeing people a different way.""",2015-04-17 08:14:19,Paper Towns,young-adult;fiction;romance;mystery;thriller;crime,John Green

I even liked their reunion to a degree. But Memphis is quite manipulate and a bit of a victim-y jerk. Yes cancer sucks, but it doesn't give you license to be a prick. It's even said in the book, but then it's turned around and it essentially does. And he somehow flips it around on Tyler and makes Memphis moving out and disappearing on him with no contact or explanation Tyler's fault. And worse Tyler accepts the blame. UGH. And even during their reunion, he's still lying and keeping secrets. He essentially uses his Cancer as an excuse to treat Tyler like crap over and over again, in the past and present.  Past issues are discussed and ""resolved""(I use that word grudgingly) but not to my satisfaction. I feel like major conversations still need to be had and emotions truly vented and felt, I kept waiting and waiting, and it never happened. Memphis had a major death wish happening, and it seriously got tiring. Basically cancer + hot sex = absolution. I had higher hopes, and while this is really down, there were good points. The sex scenes were great. The banter and friendships were awesome. Seeing Dylan and Alec again was great. Seriously interested in the next book which is Noah's!!!!

2592,676924,3,"""Book Review: ""Betrayed"" by P.C. Cast & Kristen Cast 
 After reading ""Marked,"" there was only one thing I could do and that was to continue into the series by reading, ""Betrayed."" 
 Betrayed is the second installment in the House of Night series. It is dark and sexy, and was fantastic to read. It picks up where Marked left off. 
 Our heroine, Zoey Redbird, seems to be an anomaly among fledglings in the House of Night. She is the most powerful fledgling at the House of Night and quite possibly the most powerful in vampyre history. After taking over leadership of the Dark Daughters and Sons, she seems to be settling in nicely at the House of Night finishing school. She finally feels like she belongs. In this book, Zoey is determined to change things in the school, from a snobby elitist clique to something of substance, meaning. We begin to see Zoey feel comfortable in her own skin and she actually seems to mature a little. 
 Along with Zoey's growing pains with learning to be the priestess that she seems to be training for, her love life seems to be a mess. She finds herself in love with two boys and one of her professors. Just when things begin to look up, trouble happens to the humans in her old life. They keep disappearing. Zoey must find the courage to face a betrayal that could break her heart and her soul. 
 Once I started to read this book, I couldn't put it down. It was obvious how hooked I had become. I like how the Cast's are developing the characters and how they seem to get along with each other in this series. Each character is beginning to grow into what they believe is their path in life. Even though I really like Zoey, I think I like Aphrodite and Stevie Rae a little better. They seem to be the most open and straight forward what's happening throughout the book. 
 I find it odd that the Cast's did not proofread their books though. I'm seeing a number of grammatical errors throughout the story. I can only hope they will see this in their future installations. 
 If you enjoy vampire stories, this is a good one. However, it is not like your typical vampire story. I think that is why I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would give this book 3 1/2 stars out of 5.

2596,14064,5,"""I think this book is one of my favourite books. I'd put it in my top five books and it's so re-readable, every time I read it, I get something different from it. Of course, it's Richard Matheson's 'I am Legend.' 
 It has a few flashbacks but this book is mainly split into 3 times between 1976 and 1978. And I think what this book does better than anything is character, it focussed on one guy- Robert Neville. He's dealing with alcoholism, depression and the end of the world and I feel that this gives you a real insight into what the end of the world and being alone for a long time can do to a person. 
 Although this book is technically about vampires, Matheson will always be the grandfather of the zombie genre in my eyes with this book. I think I love it so much because so much of it is surviving. You go through the motions with him of everyday survival, finding food and gasoline, researching into the science side of what is happening and this is something glossed over in a lot of these books, much to my annoyance. It's not easy to live in the apocalypse, literally or psychologically- this book truly shows that like no other. 
 Unfortunately this is not the case of the film, but that is a completely different blog post!

 A buddy read with my buddies from BBB and loving it! 
 I thought I knew dragons, since I am well versed on Dragon behavior due to my rich PNR expertise. I already knew that DRAGONS are petulant, temperamental, strong willed, gorgeous, smart, always hungry, and charming. Now I see they get sick and act like babies, just like real men do, get preconceived notions, are ready to get into a fight at the slightest provocation, and like spicy foods :-) I am glad there is much more to learn about them and I am open for the knowledge:-) 
 I also thought that Naomi Novik could not possibly make the Napoleonic-British wars more interesting then they are already, but I was wrong! She discovered a great additive to spice the whole thing up - Just Add DRAGONS!!!! Then things get really interesting:) 
 This book starts where the first one ended and the Chinese Prince and their delegation wants their dragon back! Whaaaat??? They have no claim, none, if you ask me, but obviously the two governments think differently. But as much as I disliked the Chinese in the beginning, because I feel they have no right to our Dragon, NO right!, once we see how dragons are treated as a whole in China, I felt bad for the Western dragons and it is kind of obvious that they are being mistreated. Although since in China they have all the autonomy of a human, some of them are down on their luck, just like humans.... I was very nervous that Temeraire is going to have a hard time choosing what to do. Only his dragon friends back home and Laurence were pluses for our side... :-( I am a bit melancholic with the way the book ended, but I guess it was the best we could have hoped for under the circumstances... I feel sad for all involved. I especially feel this heartbreak for the albino dragon... What will happen to her, can't the British take her home with them??? And so on, and so on... We also lost some people in battles, but it is war, I guess... 
 The weird thing about this book is that it is not chock full of action, has many sections of slow development, and plenty of descriptions, but in spite of all that, I could not put it down! It is engaging and compelling and I am a fan! I am definitely continuing with the series:)""",2015-12-10 14:51:29,"Throne of Jade (Temeraire, #2)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;young-adult,Naomi Novik

 A buddy read with my UF assassins at BB&B! We meet every Wednesday and compare our silverstone knives.... 
 It finally happened! A truly Machiavellian villain is making her play and starts by manipulating Gin and a crazy ass vampiric drug dealing boss bad guy into eliminating each-other, or at least one of them to get rid of the other for her, and whoever is left, well, she will see... 
 The problem is, Gin has become too predictable, thus allowing her friends and enemies to push her buttons in a manner which could be used for others' purposes... I have been expecting this sooner or later, and have been worried that every weakness, or strength of Gin's character, would become known to all as her visibility has grown and her anonymity is a thing of the past... Gin has been able to deal with all the attacks of her person, but she has gotten comfortable with enemies who come at her mostly straight ahead. She is not prepared for someone to play a deeper, more complex chess game with her... And the new player in town has been laying in wait and watching her for some time, learning the ways Gin reacts to different situations and weaving a web of evil and deceit that can catch even the Spider. 
 This book got back to the typical adrenaline inducing Spider books, after a slow and confusing book 10. We get to enjoy the full power of the supporting cast and especially my favorite snarky and wonderfully sarcastic pretty boy Finn. His girlfriend Bria acted a bit out of control, although it was understandable to a degree... Owen is back to being boyfriend of every girls' dreams, and Philip has their back. At the end of the book an old nemesis shows up again and proves once more that in this worlds' Ashland, sometimes is best to go around the laws and regular punitive system, and trust the good old ""kill your enemies, or they will come back to haunt you"" motto... 
 SO, I am expecting the series to go to an even higher level of villainy now that the gauntlet of war has been thrown down, so I can't wait to get into the next volumes!

2610,186074,5,"""Oh, how I loved this book. It was magical in a way only same-old Harry Potter was. It is nothing like Harry Potter though. 
 I read fantasy because, many years after childhood, I can re-experience that giddiness, that otherworldy atmosphere of a story that makes you warm and fuzzy inside. The story doesn't have to be aimed at children, but it has to make you want to be there. 
 The Name of the Wind was outstanding at that. Despite the slow, lengthy and often dark narrative, its world hooked me. The writing was effortless and enthralling. Reading only the first chapter, I knew it was going to be beautifully told. Bleak and dreary at times, I found the writing uplifting. So though the story often follows sorrowful times, it felt like it wasn't trying to shock you, to make you feel miserable. It was not trying to make an edgy 'life is cruel in these medieval-like times' stance (I'm looking at you Game of Thrones ). I couldn't sense the author's hand in the characters' fate, and that I loved. 
 But mainly, I adored this book because of Kvothe. Sometimes, for non-obvious reasons, a character just endears you. A character can make you addicted to a book. And this was Kvothe, the wonderfully flawed Kvothe. 
 Some have disliked this book because he seems too perfect. I couldn't disagree more. He is certainly a precocious, brilliant child who potentially becomes 'the most notorious wizard the world has ever seen' (not in this book). I know, a character with such virtues is usually boring and uninteresting. It's how I usually feel. There's nothing more predictable and bland than a protagonist who always wins. But Kvothe was far from that. 
 For one, Kvothe wasn't that macho-hero stereotype fantasy writers like to write about. He is realistic: sensitive and powerless at times, strong-willed and brave at others. And if he does end up being the biggest and baddest of all in the end, oh boy, does he make mistakes along the way. 
 I have much to say about this book, but much has been said already on GR. All I can say is, I was wary of this widely acclaimed series. I tend to be disappointed easily by overly hyped things, but TNOTW surprised me. It won't be to everyone's tastes, that's for sure. 
 It was quite slow, often lingering on small episodes, perhaps, not essential to the plot. The setting, on the whole, remains quite mysterious by the end, with the story focusing more on Kvothe's personal experience. There is an alternative timeline that might bore some. A lot of foreseeing: 'If I only knew at the time that...'. A LOT of time spent at the University: at the classes, with his friends, practicing sympathy, inventing stuff etc. 
 I loved all that, and ultimately, I couldn't say what made me love all these details in this book and hate similar themes in others. It gripped me.

2620,186074,4,"""Very promising first novel that doesn't, until maybe 500 pages in, read like a first novel at all. It's a pretty daunting read, especially for something you're not terribly sure of, and I will tell you that it does not sustain its level of awesome, but the awesome heights it does reach more than make up for the lows it sinks to. 
 And! It has one of the coolest introductions for a character I've seen in quite some time. ""I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with the Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. 
 You may have heard of me."" 
 And the thing is? Dude is not lying, but he's not arrogant or smarmy or all manner of things you think would go with an introduction like that. He just . . . is. 
 The book had true moments of magic, Kvothe (the aforementioned main character) playing his lute at the Eloian, telling his student Bast why people like stories, but one of the things that I loved best about it was what I loved best about Lord of the Rings. In the forward to my paperback edition of LotR, Peter S. Beagle said that Tolkien didn't invent the Middle-Earth, he took all of our daydreams and fancies and gave them a place to live, that we created the world and Tolkien put it to paper. I feel like Patrick Rothfuss has done the same thing here, he took a world and steeped it in history, with all the prejudices and old sayings and idiosyncratic superstitions, and it's our world, our prejudices, our superstitions that bring it to life.

Werewolves permeate society and LS or Lupine Syndrome is occurring all over as the government tries to figure out how to handle the LS infected persons. Mac's best friend Jason has been acting strange since Amy's death and it has become her goal to find out what really happened to her friend. 
 Review: Couldn't put it down! I really loved this book. I started reading and only go about 10 pages in and was a little unmoved by it at first. Seemed like the same teenage angst and whining...only it got so much better! I jumped from page 10 to 71 and then on and on...even when I thought the plot was going one way, the predictable way, it surprised me and took another direction. 
 Mac is a strong girl, her parents aren't in the picture and she is being raised by Tess who is fairly close to her age. I loved the werewolves in this book. I thought it was great to have them be known about and have LS be a disease contracted, rather than a supernatural ailment that only affects some. 
 The author did so good. Mac's sarcasm is wonderful and the story line is great. But I cannot say much because a lot of twists occur and I don't want to ruin them for anyone...just go read it!

2627,29780253,4,"""This is not a funny book, it is a very personal book, that shares Trevor's childhood and growing up stories from South Africa. Extremely unique and magnetic book. 
 white Swiss father and a black mother from the Xhosa tribe, there starts his story where he was already born a crime, since during apartheid, one of the worst crimes you could commit was having sexual relations with a person of another race. Therefore, his parents committed that crime. 
 Trevor couldn't even go out to play with other kids, or even his own cousins. Children could be taken. Children were taken. The wrong color kid in the wrong color area, and the government could come in, strip your parents of custody, haul you off to an orphanage. 
 His mother was religious, and Trevor was questioning religion. ""Look, Mom. I know you love Jesus, but maybe next week you could ask him to meet us at our house. Because this really wasn't a fun night."" 
 The rules about communion at Friday mass, for example, made absolutely no sense. We'd be in there for an hour of kneeling, standing, sitting, kneeling, standing, sitting, kneeling, standing, sitting, and by the end of it I'd be starving, but I was never allowed to take communion, because I wasn't Catholic. The other kids could eat Jesus's body and drink Jesus's blood, but I couldn't. And Jesus's blood was grape juice. I loved grape juice. Grape juice and crackers--what more could a kid want? And they wouldn't let me have any. I'd argue with the nuns and the priest all the time. 
 Trevor was an entrepreneur (but not of the very legal kind). He got to the hood, and started making money selling pirate music, and then becoming a professional hustler. But he ended up using his life experience to his advantage. An extraordinary man with an extraordinary story. 
 Surviving poverty, crime, religious upbringing, domestic abuse, and so many tough conditions (eating Mopane worms for example). Just a few examples of what's inside. One story includes his mom throwing him out of a driving minibus. Another of how his mother was shot in the head. Crazy story, that shows how Trevor survived and became the man he is today. 4.5 stars.""",2016-12-07 22:04:28,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,non-fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;comics;graphic,Trevor Noah

My husband and best friend read this book when it first came out and when they finished they were in agony because of the cliffhanger at the end. So I decided to wait until the 2nd book came out before I started the series. I thought this book was very well written, very detailed. Ironically for 660 pages, not a lot happened timeline wise. This novel introduced the main character, his background and the beginning of his adventures. A lesser writer could've condensed this down to 100 pages but it would not of been as good. I enjoyed every page, but I'm not ""dying"" for my husband to finish reading book 2 so I can start it. Both books are very long and they are very detailed, you have to pay attention to the book while you're reading it, if that makes any sense, because you will miss clues. 
 The only thing I can criticize is the Dragon bit at the end felt very rushed. I think he could of filled that part out a bit more, because if you're already on page 600-something, another 20 pages to explain a crucial part of the story is not going to make that bit of a difference. Maybe it was an editing thing by the publishing company who knows... At any rate, I liked it very much even though it was very long.

 Kyra's life was turned upside down when she was abducted by aliens. That 5 year disappearance managed to take everything she cared about away from her and then, just when she starts to make new connections, her new love gets taken away as well. Now, Kyra is on the run from the NSA with the other Returned, Kyra goes to extremes to find Tyler. When they discover an email that implies Tyler is alive and well....in NSA hands, Kyra is willing to risk everything to get him back. Together with a select few of the Returned, they make a plan to bust Tyler out of lockdown and maybe steal some classified info while they are at it. But these things rarely go as planned and Kyra quickly learns that every action has consequences. What kind of trouble does she find herself in? You'll just have to read to find out! 
 Kyra is still a character I adore. She's a bit stronger here than she was in The Taking, but still basically the same character. She's smart and caring and her devotion to Tyler had me sympathizing with her all the more. If you enjoyed her perspective before, you'll continue to do so here. I can't say too much else about the characters without going into spoiler territory, so I'll leave it at this: you get a decent group of people all with interesting stories and quirks, but all is not as it seems. 
 I really enjoyed The Taking. It was one of those books that I just could not put down. From page one, I was hooked. I was desperate to learn not only what the hell had happened to Kyra, but also how everyone would react to her return. So I was ecstatic to see the sequel up on Edelweiss and I didn't hesitate to grab it immediately. This, I thought, would be awesome. This would be a novel that I would burn my way through as I did with the first one. That, however, was not the case. While I did enjoy it and I think it's a fair continuation of the story, I didn't love it like I did with the first one. Some of the magic was missing. I think there are several things that contributed to this. The pass was quite a bit slower here and not much gets accomplished. It seemed to have just a little of that middle book syndrome thing going on. We get action and adventure, but it's pretty clear that nothing is really going to be resolved here. 
 My big problem was the missing Tyler. Tyler was the magical ingredient, in my opinion. The first novel had this great contemporary science fiction vibe that I adored. A big part of that was the romance between Kyra and Tyler. Tyler was abducted at the end of The Taking, in order to save his life, and we don't get him back early on here. We don't get him back until the novel is half over. Even then, let's just say the reunion is not everything you have been dreaming of, okay? In Tyler's absence, Simon tries to put the moves on Kyra, pulling us into that dreaded love triangle territory. It was skirted around in The Taking and I was hoping we could continue to avoid it here, but no such luck. Simon has no qualms telling Kyra how he feels and that she can't wait for Tyler forever. Which, quite honestly, made me want to slap him. Kyra, for her part, wasn't much better. I won't say much because I don't want to have to label this as a spoilery review, but her reactions to him aren't always the resounding rejection that it should be. 
 Basically, this novel is good, but it doesn't quite live up to the awesomeness that was The Taking. It's entertaining and has some twists that you don't see coming, but that gets bogged down in a slow moving plot, love triangle, and yet another cliffhanger. I still recommend it to everyone who enjoyed the first novel and I think highly of it, but I just a little disappointed because it didn't live up to my expectations. Regardless, it gave me quite a few answers and another peak into this world that Derting has created. That's enough to satisfy me....for now.

2640,31934391,3,"""So I started off really liking this book. Girl has crush on childhood friend, boy moves away, girl still has feelings but gets on with her life, boy comes back and feelings come back. What's not to like? Especially when boy has feelings too. All in all it was a sweet story. 
 But. 
 There were a few things that I did not like and it kind of bugs me-the last one dropped my rating from a 4 to a 3. 
 Logan is kind of an ass. He sees what he wants to see without wanting to know the truth, and guess what? It bit him in the ass. Then again, Valerie didn't try to make him see the truth, just let him keep on thinking what he wanted. But truthfully, her lies and mis-truths destroyed a lot of things as well... So maybe they were perfect for each other? 
 But my biggest peeve, that has turned me off on the entire series was the last frikking page. 
 Val writes out a list of ""Sexual Will Never Do"" but doesn't title it, so Logan assumes these are things she wants to do when he finds the list. Included are things like anal, orgys, glory holes, public sex, etc. So he thinks she wants to do these, even though once they finally start being honest, she corrects him. 
 Nonspoiler: So the last page, damn near last 2 lines he says he casually mentions something he wants to do with/to her.  He wants to borrow a drill to go make her a glory hole. Then the book ends. Seriously?  She laughs and the book ends. Was it a joke? Was he serious? It was hard to tell, but THE BOOK JUST ENDED. To me that was a shitty way to end this book. And it just pissed me off. And quite honestly, turned me off the next books. Instead of having a smile on my face, I had a sour look. Not because it was raunchy, but because it just felt like it came from out of nowhere and was just plopped in there with no follow up.""",2017-07-03 06:25:09,On the Plus Side (A Perfect Fit #2),romance;fiction,Alison Bliss

2644,186074,2,"""So I'm mainly editing this now cause Rothfuss recently got announced as a stretch goal/likely additional writer for a game I'm really looking forward to (Torment: Tides of Numenera) and as my rating would suggest I kinda have mixed feelings about it. Well, I'm looking forward to seeing how he contributes to it, anyway. 
 But back to this book. This is mostly going off memory right now, but it wasn't actually that bad of a book (although I'm kinda glad goodreads suggests two stars = ""it was ok"" rather than bad). It's actually quite fun to read, and I'd recommend it if you're looking into fantasy series to pick up and have an interest in stories told by storytellers about stories and being semi-meta about it. That kind of stuff actually would appeal to me too. It's just... 
 Kvothe is too much of a Mary Sue. I'm probably repeating what dozens of other reviewers have already said, but I pretty much felt the same way about it by the end of the book. I don't know if it was the narrator or the setting or the story or all of the above but it felt like everyone in the universe of this book loves to heap praises on how mysterious Kvothe is, how heroic Kvothe is, how much of a fantastic child prodigy with a tragic childhood and future Kvothe is (almost like Batman except Batman's cooler, no contest). Even though he clearly does make mistakes sometimes and isn't perfect by any means, the way his story is framed, it all just feels too convenient for him. Even the times when he's just a poor kid wandering the streets looking for his next meal, and you're just waiting for when he'll rise above it all and become the hero he's bound to become- and then it happens just as expected. He gets his next big break and it's all upwards from there. 
 By the end of the book, I kinda felt like the fascination and intrigue about the guy just wore off on me, so I couldn't really take his present misery as seriously anymore. The writing and prose itself is great and all, but Kvothe as a character doesn't really jive with me the same way, so I don't feel as inclined towards reading more about him even though it's supposed to be a trilogy. That said, considering that Kvothe himself is the narrator, I think the later installments would benefit from further exploring the idea of his story being told to us as unreliable. I think it would make for a more substantial read. 
 With that said, I don't entirely doubt Rothfuss's abilities as a writer, so I guess I'll still look forward to reading his future works, including his contribution to Torment.

 This was a fantastic MC foundation book. If you haven't read MC books in the past, they tend to have a great deal of history and background and this story is no exception, the difference for me while reading was how well the information was presented. I never found myself confused or needing to look back for information, or even worse, trying to remember who different characters were. MC books, when the story is well told, are not full of hearts and flowers, but tend to be very raw, gritty and many times full of disturbing subject matter that the outside world does not regularly see. This book does contain some very difficult scenes in the very beginning that some people will have trouble reading, but I would tell you that by the end of the book, you will be very happy that you read it. So let's get start, shall we? 
 The title is Renegade Lady because this is the story of Jenna aka ""Ice"" and her journey with the Renegade Sons MC. She is the child of a Renegade Son and the daughter of an old lady. Jenna grows up knowing that this is not the life for her, but when she is only 16 her mother dies and everything changes. She is thrust into the ugly side of the life. A side that the rest of the club doesn't even know exists. After sustaining horrible abuse, she is finally rescued by Chipper, the son of the head of the Sons and he brings her home to the Big Clifty clubhouse with him. 
 Once arriving in Big Clifty, Jenna becomes the club princess. She is raised by Chipper and his wife and loved by all. Especially Kidd, Chipper's little brother and Jenna's best friend. When she finishes school, Jenna has a choice to make: no longer be a part of the club, become an old lady or become a club whore. Breaking the hearts of many, Jenna chooses to become a club whore. Over the years she has developed a complicated relationship with Kidd and this is just one more issue between them. As the years pass and she continues to work for the club, their feelings continue to grow as they continue to either fight or ignore each other. 
 For me to even try to give you more detail would take another 3 pages. Like I said, an MC story has tons of details, but this story was s surprisingly quick read. I was instantly in love with Jenna, Mindy and Kidd. As the story unfolded, I was riveted. The plot was solid and strong. Jenna had some hard choices to make and she is only 16 when the story starts, so they choices start as the ideas of a scared teenager and those fears drive many of her choices clear into adulthood. As she finally starts to let Kidd (and others for that matter,) into her heart and she reveals herself, she transforms and grows into an amazing woman. It is fun to watch. One of the things I love about the book is that Kidd fell in love with her when she was still young and relatively happy and carefree and continued to love her as she transformed into ""Ice"" the cold, hard-as-nails woman. 
 ""I love everything about you. I have since you were just a kid Even when you were too young for me to love you, I still did. I'll keep on loving you until the day I die."" 
 I am truly looking forward to the next installment of this series. The foundation has been set for some great stories to be told about the rest of the characters and I can't wait to read them.

 Ooooh, boy. I went into this with such high expectations, despite knowing it to be different to the film. And well... it's a letdown. The casual racism (it was written in 1954, but really, we could do less with descriptions of how white Robert Neville is), the cheap emotional pulls, the climax that isn't. Robert Neville, last man on earth, in a world populated by vampires. The premise is good, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. 
 The deaths of his wife and daughter are glossed over, and there is no real sense of horror, at all. He's prepared at all times, and it makes it incredibly hard to sympathise, especially as the story progresses. Yes, he's scared of the vampires, but he isn't running out of food or water, so there is no impending danger of starvation and death. The appearance of the dog is also played for a cheap tug on the heart strings. There is nothing at stake here, he had no dog, he almost has a dog, then he doesn't have a dog any more. In the film, I found myself rooting for Robert, really wanting him to make it out alive. In the book, by the end I was just glad to be done with it all.

 I don't really know what I think about this book. Yes, I really enjoyed it. I think the story is very well written and interestingly structured.

The story never gripped me enough that I couldn't put the book down, and I never had that urge to know what's going to happen next. Even now, after more than 700 pages, I'm still waiting for the story to get to the point.

2656,28963772,4,"""Best two and a half weeks of my life came from a girl who was never meant to give me anything. And she was giving me everything. 
 Four Letter Word. The title is so well thought out and unique and creative in the manner it was woven into the story. I've only read a handful of J. Daniels' books and this certainly topped in the steamy category. Sorry Ben! 
 I absolutely loved the premise of the book. It was unique in its concept and in the way the title was interspersed in the story. 
 The book starts with Sydney starting a new phase in her life. A fresh story, that includes leaving her husband and moving in with her best friend Tori. A new story, a new job and new friends. The night she moves in with Tori, is the night the best friends learn that they have been burned by men in the worst way possible. And it was that night Sydney made an out of character decision, that not only turned her world upside down but was also the start of an amazing story. 
 It was everything. From the start, from the first mistaken phone call, it was everything. 
 It all started with a phone call. A phone call to an absolute stranger because of a wrong number, turned into multiple texts and calls between Sydney and Brian. 
 The man on the other end of the phone, Brian Savage, is battling with his own demons that have plagued his consciousness for a while. His ray of light, in his otherwise darkness, is Sydney and her spit fire attitude which formed an unusual relationship and was the start of a friendship between the two. 
 I was waiting on pins and needles and holding my breath for the moment when Brian and Sydney would meet and J. Daniels did not disappoint! Their connection, even before they had met each other was very strong and when they did meet is was explosive! Literally! 
 One word that held so much and sounded so loud, and if it was written, I could read it forever. 
 Brian is dealing with a lot of things at the same time. He hides a lot of things from his family, friends and Sydney and one secret that he is hell bent on telling anyone. 
 But we all know how the deep hidden secrets have the ability to pop up. When Brian's secret is revealed, it leaves behind heartbreak and destruction. But with all the pain came a moment for Brian, where he was free of the guilt he carried with himself and I LOVED that moment. It was the emotional climax and the beginning of things getting better for him. 
 Now, while I thoroughly enjoyed every minute reading this book, I was not satisfied with the ending. I wanted something more for Brian and Sydney in the end. The ending just felt a tad bit rushed. But since this is a series, I am assuming we will get a few peaks of Brian and Sydney life through the eyes of their best friends, Jamie and Tori. 
 Overall, this was a fun and sexy read and if you are looking for something that will make you flip pages then rest assured, this is the one! 
 I'm going to give you Wild for the rest of your life and so much of it you won't have room to feel anything else.

2657,14064,4,"""Well isn't this book a ray of sunshine. 
 I was incredibly surprised to find that this was written in the fifties. It seems way ahead of its time and it reads like it was written today. 
 I enjoyed this take on vampires and the end of the world as we know it. The story does have its share of frighteningly eerie moments and I found Matheson's vampires to be pretty menacing. It turned out to be much more profound than I was expecting, reminding me of my experience while first reading The Road (the moment when Robert finds the dog even gave me the same hope as when the man and boy find the bunker). 
 The ending kind of threw me off a bit, but I still enjoyed it. The story leaves me wanting more, and I think that's what makes it all so sad.

 The characters were too young for my idea of capabilities. Then again they were raised with a family, its similar to gallagher girls, get raised to do something, do it good. Occasionally the characters were cliche, but it worked with the story. I loved the names Ally Carter picks for her characters, they add extra character to them, it suits them, and they are just plainly beautiful names. Even though the character may be cheesy or two young, they are definitely fun. They made me laugh, here is one of my favourite quotes from the book. 
 ""How'd you get in here?"" 
 She raised her eyebrows. ""You pick pockets."" Kat watched his hand fly to his back pocket. ""I can pick locks. Looking for this?"" she asked, holding up his wallet. ""Oops. Maybe I can pick pockets too."" 
 Except Nick, he was cocky. I half trusted him. Kat picked him up on the street without searching him up if you could trust him. I saw something coming with him. 
 Kat wasn't the strongest of characters, she wasn't the easiest to sympathize with even though she is the narrator of the novel, nor did she know best. She wanted OUT of the thievery game after all, WHY? 
 W.W. Hale. Hale, Just Hale. *sighs adoringly* 
 There was no romance between them, there was the flirting, you could see the potential, but nothing happened. Hopefully something soon because I can see that Hale will make up for the cutest boyfriend. 
 Our villain wasn't all that creepy, didn't feel as threatening. and was rather sweet. Not the typical mafia guy for sure. 
 Sometimes the heist itself was dragged out with the planning, for such a short novel they spent too much time thinking about the heist. It was okay, yet could definitely be better.

 I would rate this a 4 stars but it legitimately lost a whole star rating because of how disappointed i was in this entire book. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing like i expected it to be from all the love it got EVERYWHERE. 
 This may sound petty, but this was a huge book to me and it was super slow. The entire book is pretty much a prequel to the actual story, or just the exposition in the whole plot diagram you used to make when you were in elementary school. The climax was weak and the ending brought forward no emotions or amazing plot twists. In fact, i was fairly annoyed over not only how un-climactic (is thay a word) it was but also how i had spend 600 pages reading about what he was learning only for him to barely use it in the climax of the book. 
 That being said, i'm not saying i didn't enjoy the ride. I like stories where the main character is learning magic and etc. But, this book honestly led to nowhere. And the ride itself irritated me also! I thought the extra drama with Denna and Ambrose was petty and unnecessary and just led to a lot of extra problems. 
 I felt no chemistry between Denna and Kvothe at all. I honestly felt bad for him because he resembled a little puppy, just chasing her. 
 Kvothe himself is very very overpowered but it dodn't bother me much for some reason.

 My biggest complaint: Rothfuss, God love him, needs a really good editor. He's such a great writer, I can understand the hesitancy to rein him in. But after the umpteenth literary meander, I just wished the book was twice as long and covered more ground. 
 That said, and the thing that had me panting for more, is that the author spins a really good yarn. It was so unique and respectful of its characters...and its readers. It borrowed from all kinds of mythologies, but was very much its own story. It was foreign yet real: the best and most believable ""world building"" I've read since Song of Ice & Fire books.

2670,13872,2,"""2.5 stars. All of the 2.5 stars are for a great idea and good prose. 
 I'm a child of the internet and I'm pretty weathered in the ""things that shock me"" department, so my rating isn't really a commentary on how fucked up the plot is. There were some eyebrow-raising parts, but nothing that I couldn't power through. 
 As a primer, in Geek Love we're taken through the life and times of Olympia ""Oly"" Binewski, who now goes by Olympia McGurk, an albino hunchback dwarf who spent her entire childhood in a traveling circus/freak show (""fabulon"" is what it's called in the book, and I apologize because I don't really know what to call it) run by her parents, Aloysius and Lily. And that's about the most basic, tame part of the whole book. It's a ride from start to finish. Oly has a number of siblings, all of whom were intentionally engineered to be born abnormally by Al and Lil, who experimented through each of Lil's many pregnancies with various combinations of drugs designed to produce unusual offspring. 
 This can all pretty much be found in any summary of this book. Goodreads's summary also includes this information, and this is where Dunn (or the jacket copy writer) loses me: ""Geek Love throws its sulfurous light on our notions of the freakish and the normal, the beautiful and the ugly, the holy and the obscene."" 
 So here's the thing. I think a book of this type really does have the potential to say something, or many things, about able bodies, societal standards of beauty, self-image, bioethics, religion, and normativity. Seriously, all of that! Yeah, it definitely does. But this book doesn't say any of it. 
 We as readers spend pretty much no time on the ethical implications of the decisions made in this book to intentionally deform children, so much so that I assume we're not supposed to empathize with the idea. And yet... the Binewski kids love their deformities, derisively call others ""norms,"" and emphatically believe that they would not choose to be born ""normal"" if given the choice. We also see Arty's church of people who willingly deform themselves, another group of people we spend a lot of time hearing about but whose choices are never empathetically justified to the reader.  I struggle to see the larger picture. I want books to shine some light on dark, ugly corners of society, and to me, this book just creeps into dark, ugly corners without telling me why we're there (besides to creep me out). 
 I also had real problems with the pacing, which is why I specified above that the prose was good but didn't say ""the writing."" For the first third of the book, we're keeping pace evenly with the past (time in the circus) and the future (Oly is 39 and living in ""regular society"" in Portland). Gradually, this goes wonky until we get a crazy long stint of past time toward the end of the book, followed by a short denouement in the present, followed by the end of the book. I was really captivated by the long stint of past time--it contains the rising action and climax--but it didn't work for me given the layout of the first part of the book, even though it did retain my attention. The climax itself, which I won't spoil, was also very briefly described and disappointing for something that's such a big deal.""",2013-10-18 11:49:30,Geek Love,fiction;fantasy;paranormal,Katherine Dunn

When I finally stumbled across a Kindle copy I could rent, I was excited to read a book that so many people clearly also want to read. I was, unfortunately, a little disappointed by All the Light We Cannot See . There were times when I was tempted to quit reading since it often felt to me as if there was no plot at all. The rich descriptions were really enjoyable for the first fifty pages and then I found myself anxious for the story to get a move on. 
 Despite its slow pace, this is a beautifully told story about ordinary people during WWII. After reading so many war stories where every character is a hero, it was nice to come across one with characters that felt like actual people for better and for worse. At its best, this is an inspiring tale of resistance and about the goodness in daily life that often goes untold.

 I really enjoyed both Grady and Max. While both have very different personalities and backgrounds they for sure are similar in a lot of ways. 
 Grady at first glance is your typical rich boy throwing his toys out the pram, However there is more than meets the eye. Having dealt with a tragedy no young boy should deal with he reacted pretty much how you would expect and impressionable teenager to. Of course he only saw what he wanted to see and acted out but he had so many layers to his personality that you can't help but love him and his disfunctional tendencies. 
 Max was love at first word for me. I just got the feels from him and knew he was going to be my hero of the story. He wasn't all white night in armour and for sure had his own demons to work through but he was definitely the more grown up got his baggage more together of the two. I love that although he didn't want to admit his love he didn't deny his feeling either. He most definitely was the fixer. 
 I found I really enjoyed the slower paced romance between the pair. The chemistry was obviously there from the beginning and yes they did have sex pretty swiftly however the romance itself was slow building and extremely believable. There is definitely a lot of miscommunication between the main H/H and also between each of them and their fathers. I enjoyed how the story focuses on that sometimes we all need a different opinion to see the whole picture and how not talking or truly understanding a situation can be detrimental to a persons view on said situation. Not all is what it seems and yes while this is a romance it does touch on some pretty intense subjects. 
 I absolutely loved the character growth throughout. It's believable and not instantaneous but more of a slow change. The storyline is gripping unique and loveable. A little rollercoaster of emotions however the journey is so worth the outcome. The side characters play important parts in this story and balance it out so that your not getting to much of one thing.

2675,18698371,5,"""I was provided a copy of this book by YA Bound Book Tours and the author in exchange for an honest review. 
 It's been awhile since I had gotten so easily wrapped up in both the romance in a book and the book itself. The chemistry between Aiden and Cameron was amazing and I'm so glad it wasn't insta-love! I like the idea of the instant connection between two people though. I have actually meant two people like that- my best friend and my boyfriend- so I really do understand what she was feeling with Aiden. I also really felt for them both. They were two very different people with very different ideas of the future who got caught up in something neither of them were ready for. Aiden's strained relationship with his father added a very good aspect to the story, since it affected his life in so many different ways, from his job to his idea of marriage. 
 I was very impressed with the overall flow of the story. I stayed engaged through and it didn't just rely on the romance to keep it going. I loved reading about Cameron's passion for advertising and to kinda see into the world of advertising a little bit, and to see how much work really goes into marketing a product. It was a career path I was considering a couple years ago, and still have a slight interest in, so it made my connection to the book even better! The story really didn't lull at any point, there was always something going on to keep the reader interested. I would actually love to see a sequel so that we can find out what happens after that ending, because, really, who wouldn't want to read more about that hot, passionate relationship?? Plus, I would love to actually see Aiden take on not only the husband role, but also the father role :)""",2015-07-22 07:25:35,No Kissing Allowed (No Kissing Allowed #1),romance;young-adult,Melissa  West

2680,13872,4,"""I've been trying to write a review for this since I finished it back in August, but I don't really know how to describe it. Firstly, I really enjoyed it. It's a book I've thought about a few times since finishing it, which is a good sign. 
 Geek Love is the story of a dysfunctional circus family. The parents decided they wanted special children, and experimented with drugs throughout each pregnancy, producing four deformed children- Arty, who has flippers for arms, conjoined twins Iphy and Elly, and Oly, who is a bald, albino dwarf. But on their last pregnancy, they have Chick, who isn't physically deformed, though he was also affected by the drugs. 
 The novel looks at what makes people 'freaks' and what makes people 'norms'. It's difficult to describe without spoiling anything, because part of what makes this novel so enjoyable is not knowing what to expect, but the idea of normality is dismissed by almost everyone in the novel. The children are special because of their deformities. There are ways to make yourself special if you really want to be. 
 And yet it's not all about physical deformities, because the most special child is the non-deformed one, and the least special is the one who sounds the most unique. 
 The characters are fantastic. Arty is a fascinating villain, partly motivated by his disability, but not in the way you'd expect. Determined to be the biggest star of the family freak show, he is manipulative, cruel and somehow human underneath it all. Chick is adorable, and you just ended up feeling bad for him throughout the story. He's extremely realistic, and his story is just heartbreaking to be honest. Oly is the dullest of the family, but that's the point. She's always lived her whole life in the shadow of her siblings, and she's got no star quality. Even as she tells the story, she's aware of this, and it leads to a quietly desperate character. The relationship between the siblings is amazing, and is incredibly real. 
 In saying all that, the novel does have some flaws. I feel like the whole plotline with Mary and Miranda was a bit unnecessary. I see what the author was trying to do with it, but it worked better when it was just the story of the circus. And the end. In one way, I really liked it. The whole idea of Chick destroying the circus? Loved it. But it was rushed. The whole story was moving at a slow pace, letting us see everything in detail, and then suddenly the climax goes by in the space of a page? What the hell was that about? And then you're kind of finished with the story, ready to put it down and think about what you read, having really enjoyed it, and then you have pages and pages left of the Mary plotline, which mostly described her swimming with Oly. If that was going to be there, it should have come before the end of the circus plotline, so we could finish on a high.  
 A really good read, dark and disturbing while still remaining human and emotional. Definitely recommend.""",2014-08-03 11:46:11,Geek Love,fiction;fantasy;paranormal,Katherine Dunn

2682,58027,3,"""Grace Marks was a real person, a maid convicted of the murder of her employer, Thomas Kinnear, in 1843. She was originally sentenced to death but ended up in an insane asylum, briefly, before spending 30 years in prison and eventually being pardoned. I think she did it, but the book takes careful pains to leave room for doubt (and spirit possession).  
 Alias Grace moves back and forth in time as Grace recounts her story to psychologist Simon Jordan, and the most interesting parts of the book take place in present time when Jordan's behavior and inner thoughts reveal him to be just as much - if not more - of a creepy potential psychopath as Grace. Sometimes Jordan passes off his violent and misogynistic impulses as fleeting thoughts that shouldn't be any cause for concern, but, as he gets dragged deeper into Grace's story and life, he loses (cedes?) control and his actions start sliding to meet his dark thoughts. 
 The power play between Grace and Dr Jordan was interesting to read, and when the story starts to follow Grace more closely in the past - leading up to the climactic killing of Thomas Kinnear and his mistress/housekeeper Nancy Montgomery - the sticky, one-sided sexual tension between them loses some of its taughtness and backs away from the edge of the really creepy shit, to the detriment of the book as a whole, I think. That the relationship between Dr Jordan and his ""subject"" is creepier and darker than the events surrounding the murder that he's trying to investigate is at the core of the book. Dr Jordan likes his women weepy, fragile and reluctant, and Grace proves to be a tough nut to crack. The back and forth between them - coy and candid, sane and delusional, gauzy dreams and stark reality - is weird and fascinating. 
 I read recently that Sarah Polley is making a mini-series based on the book for the CBC, and I'm really looking forward to seeing how well the atmospheric tension translates to TV.""",2016-06-25 05:51:07,Alias Grace,fiction;history;historical fiction;biography;mystery;thriller;crime,Margaret Atwood;Brigitte Walitzek

2685,186074,3,"""It took me a while to warm up to this book, but once I did I certainly enjoyed it. (I would give it 3.5 stars, and I keep changing my mind about whether to round it up or down.) The book is about the history of the main character (Kvothe), as described by Kvothe to a writer many years later. I was not a fan of the time switching (the first few chapters are set in the ""present time,"" and almost all of the rest are his back story, with a few ""interlude"" chapters that return to events of the present time. The present time events were completely uninteresting to me, so I found the interlude chapters annoying). 
 The beginning of Kvothe's story did not impress me; his tale of childhood precocity, tragedy, and poverty felt unoriginal (been there, done that in other fantasy stories). But once he went to the University the story picked up and felt more original. There were some elements I found annoying (for example, the female characters were pretty bad), but overall I enjoyed it. For the last half of the book I lost track of time as I flew through the pages. The ending isn't quite a cliffhanger, but it's certainly not an ending (it's more like, ""this book has gotten too long, so let's just stop here. See you in the next one!"")... and when it ended my first thought was that I hoped the next book was published because I wanted to read more. So with that as my final impression, I clearly enjoyed it overall. (I enjoyed it but I wouldn't categorize it as a high-quality novel. I wish I could rate those two dimensions separately in Goodreads.) 
 (As an aside, the author seems to have a thing about women's hair. There are a few too many descriptions of women's hair falling around them and of those women touching or moving their hair.)""",2012-04-04 00:00:00,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

I sent it to my Kindle again and was surprised to see it show up. I figured it was high time I read and reviewed the story. Luckily it's about novella length, maybe shorter, so I thought it'd be fast and easy. 
 Dead Sexy Dragon is the first book in a paranormal series featuring shape-shifting (you guessed it!) dragons. Cora's the heroine fleeing from some trouble to her late brother's best friend and old Marine buddy, Stig Wyvern (I see what you did thar). Unfortunately for the both of them, it's his time of the month. Just kidding, but he goes through a nine-day period every three years where he's in heat. Sadly it's not called pon farr. 
 Anywho, they've been hot for each other for years but neither of them knows it. Naturally. Pretty soon, like the next day, they have loads of sex after she finds out he's a dragon. The sexual interactions take up around 40% of the book and treads the line between romance and erotica. Some stuff happens that I don't want to give away, but Cora ends up in peril, and then Stig. It's a romance so obviously you know how it ends. 
 The story is pretty rushed, and the first couple of pages were a bit rough, but there are some interesting ideas here, so I just might pick up the next book and see where it's going. In the end, it didn't rock my socks, but it was an entertaining way to spend an hour or so.

 So I've already finished this short 3 volume series much to my dismay but I'll try to keep each of these reviews short and pertaining to the individual issue as best I can. Also this is the first review I've done in quite awhile...Hell it's the first thing I've read all the way through in awhile (I think the disappointment of Joe Hill's The Fireman broke me for awhile.) I'm gonna try to minimize the summarizing as much as I can. All the info of the plot can be found in another review or on the summary page of the book itself. I really feel like I burn myself out on the summarizing in all of my reviews and lose any decent points I may (or may not) have made. 
 So even though the cover and plot summary of Alex + Ada might lead you to believe this is a big A.I. romance story the truth is Ada is not really much of a character in this first volume. Ava is an X5, a life like android capable of sentient thought but ever since an A.I. related massacre it has become illegal to activate their sentience (if you even knew how.) Long story short: Alex is a lonely guy who doesn't have a ton of personality. Al received Ada as a gift from his creepy fireball grandmother. Alex feels a strange connection to Ada but is bummed that she is incapable of sentience. He seeks out a way to bring her to ""life"" so to speak. You get where this is going. 
 The first volume is a bit of a slow burner, clearly all leading up to an important decision that will obviously be made in the end. I confess I found myself pretty fascinated as the story slowly unfolds. There's little romance in this volume but you get a feel for Alex and the world he inhabits and I think this ground work had to be laid for the second volume to be so good.

2699,186074,5,"""The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss is the 1st in The Kingkiller Chronicle Series. 
 This epic fantasy series is really deep, really detailed, really good. First, I will confess it dragged in the beginning, and it took a little willpower to keep going. Then all of a sudden I was hooked and don't really remember why I thought there was a problem. 
 Anyway, this book tells the story of a legendary magician/swordfighter/musician/assassin, Kvothe (pronounced Quothe), presently an innkeeper who seems to be in hiding with his assistant Bast. He is going by the name Kote. When a chronicler finds him, he agrees to tell his story, as long as it is recorded precisely, and which he says will take 3 days. This first book in the series represents what he told on the first day (note that it takes much longer to read - it's a lengthy tale). 
 Kvothe tells of his early childhood, as a member of the Edema Ruh, a group of travelling performers, where he learned to play the lute as well as act. He tells of Abnethy, who joined their troup for a while and started teaching Kvothe ""sympathy"", a form of magic, after Kvothe saw him ""call the wind"". He tells of the death of his parents by the ""Chandrian"", of his three years living on the streets of Tarbean, and finally making his way to the University where he wants to continue his education in ""sympathy"" among other disciplines, although he cannot afford tuition. The University is not for the average student, but Kvothe is not average. He has always picked things up very fast, and can already do things that those studying for years can not. He will have to prove himself again and again. His young age, his brazen attitude, and the fact that he does try to circumvent procedures don't help his cause. He makes a few enemies along the way, especially since he rises up the ranks faster than other students. Oh, and he tells us about Denna, the girl of his dreams. 
 For a first book, Rothfuss has outdone himself. His writing just flows. The thought of two more books in the same vein....WOW !""",2014-12-31 16:58:41,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 I had heard of Perkins' previous novels from the Anna and the French Kiss trilogy but had never picked it up as I felt that it wasn't really my type of book. But I decided to give this 'teen slasher' a go as I thought it was different from the author's previous works. 
 First up, the build up toward the killings was a nice set up but ailed to really insitgate any real suspense and fear in me. The victims were minor characters which as a reader I failed to care about. 
 Despite the gruesome setup, I felt that it could have been better as the killings all followed the same pattern. 
 There were also other subplots regarding the main character, Makani Young's secret. When it was eventually revealed all I felt was like what? That's it? I was hoping for something worse than that. It seemed stupid and annoying to be honest. Like where were all the adults during that scene? 
 It was underwhelming - especially when the killer was revealed about halfway through the book. 
 Perhaps with less of the romance (albeit it being kinda cute) and more clarity on the motives of the killer (instead of it being more of a senseless act of murder with the same patterns commited on teens). There was little to no suspense or enough fear instigated. Furthermore, the victims were minor characters which I did not really care about.

2703,186074,4,"""It's about time, I can hear some of you saying. This guy raves about Neil Gaiman, talks a lot about the mythology of story whenever he talks about Fables or The Unwritten, and he still hasn't managed to read Patrick Rothfuss? Where does he get off? 
 Well, consider that error corrected. As mentioned previously, I moved him on up my list of books to read based on his review of The Ocean at the End of the Lane, and I don't regret it. Consider that I managed to make my way through a 722-page novel in about two weeks, while also considering that I've been working on Dan Simmons' 896-page epic Carrion Comfort since last November. The novel moves at a quick pace, and the story flows naturally and compellingly. There's something almost poetic about parts of the novel, but the rest of it reads like a summer beach-read, with good characters, interesting plot development, and proper antagonists. Rothfuss has given credit to Gaiman as an influence, and while parts of it show here, his style is different enough for him to stand on his own. He's no imitator, and that's a great thing. 
 The story is that of Kvothe, a hero most folks in the novel know through bardic tales. In the novel, Kvothe tells his life's story to a scribe, starting with his time as a travelling entertainer with his family, his time living on the streets as a beggar, and his time at the University, which he attends to become (basically) a wizard. It's more complicated than that, with Kvothe running into recurring characters throughout his life, and with weighty revelations occurring during that time. The Name of the Wind is just one-third of Kvothe's story, covering the first night he tells his tale to the scribe. The novel ends with some of the plot points resolved, but like the Harry Potter series, the overarching story is yet to be told. 
 Speaking of Harry Potter, readers will find some similarities between the two stories once Kvothe arrives at the University. There are some trials to overcome, with a teacher and student who both despise him to the point of attempting to ruin his life, though at least here Rothfuss gives us concrete reasons why. What works well, though, is that Rothfuss stacks the deck strongly against Kvothe, giving him seemingly insurmountable challenges to overcome. It's very easy to root for him, even if he sometimes comes across as arrogant, because that unfairness against him makes the reader support him even more. It's a deft achievement, and one that I'm not sure I've ever really realized. 
 I'm looking forward to the next volume, though I may have to pace myself with it, since the third volume hasn't been published (or even completed) yet. But considering that the first novel is 722 pages and the second one is 1120 pages, I expect the third one will be 1300 pages long. Given how good the story is so far, and how high my expectations for the future novels are, it's hard to complain.""",2013-06-23 17:09:18,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

The book jumps right into things with Eve facing off with some 'jenks', but after all the time she has spent fighting as she stands there she thinks that maybe she'd be better off just giving up. 
 Enter Gage, the boy who was once Eve's great love, who of course broke her heart before the crave happened. He sees that she isn't going to fight back and saves her setting them on a course to work together to make it to safety and find her sister. 
 I really enjoyed the fast paced feel of the novel. There was always something new happening to keep you on your toes. Martin does a fantastic job of world building and showing us what life is like for the survivors of the crave. I liked Eve, she's badass and doesn't take shit from anyone especially Gage. I liked her even more when we found out what she was like before the crave and the things she had to deal with from people including her family and Gage. 
 I've gotta say I was not a fan of Gage. I know that by the end of the book a lot of people liked him, but not me. The scenes between them that were romantic kind of made my stomach turn and I'm not sure why. I didn't love what we saw of Olive either. The journey she's been on since being separated from her sister is a lot darker than I would have imagined. 
 While the story was well written and the plot was interesting I couldn't really get into the book. I'm not sure why, because I really did like Eve. Seeing her transformation to the strong, independent woman she is now is really awesome. There was so much character growth despite the fact that the story started after the crave and we only see pieces before it as her looking back. 
 Despite the fact that I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected to, I'd definitely recommend it for post-apocalyptic story lovers because it's got everything you could possibly ask for in it!""",2013-11-20 04:07:23,"Alive (Crave, #1)",romance;fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult,Megan D. Martin

Here he makes lifelong friends as well as lifelong enemies, falls in love, and has more than his share of adventure. This book is the first in a trilogy.

 This book, the inspiration for the classic Hitchcock film of the same name, begins with a chance meeting on a train. Guy Haines, an architect whose career is on the verge of blossoming into greatness, is traveling to meet his wife and negotiate a divorce so he can marry the woman of his dreams. Charles Bruno is a spoiled rich kid who also happens to be an alcoholic psychopath. They share drinks, and then confidences. Haines speaks of his wife, a serial cheater who refuses to cooperate about the divorce. Bruno speaks of his father, who (according to Bruno) refuses to give him access to the money that is rightfully his. The suspense builds from this encounter as Bruno and his madness insinuate themselves into Haines' life with tragic and inevitable results. As with many stories that stand the test of time, this one prompts a few existential questions. Are there good people and evil people or is there good and evil in everyone? And specific to this story, is anyone -- any ""Guy"" -- capable of murder given the right circumstances? Can a person be driven to madness by another's madness? Before you say certainly not I -- give this classic thriller a read. You may change your mind.""",2015-03-19 11:55:02,Strangers on a Train,fiction;mystery;thriller;crime,Patricia Highsmith

 See the BOOK REPORT CARD at The Fairytale Nerd. 
 The first thing I noticed when I started reading this book is the way Dante speaks. 
 The dude turns and flips me off. 
 Right as the guy's about to turn the corner, I flick my wrist in his direction. The yellow of his soul flips on, and seconds later, a small red seal attaches to the light. That prick needs to learn some manners. I form my hands into guns and fire them off in his direction, ""Pow! Pow!"" 
 THAT bothered me, honestly. It made me very uncomfortable. But as I read on, his speech and expressions sort of... grew on me. I got used to it. Eventually. And now, I even think the way he speaks matches his personality well. 
 Now let me tell you something about Dante Walker. He's cocky. He's rich. He's hot and charming. He knows it, and he knows how to use it to his advantage. What do you expect? He's a demon. Basically, he's made of things that make girls offer their underwear to him. And then there's Charlie. Not a striking beauty. She's awkward and an outcast. But she's happy as f@ck. And she's as pure as they come. 
 I enjoyed the characters, even the secondary ones. Each has a unique side to them that isn't found in other books. But it would've better had there been more interaction with the secondary characters, most especially the supernatural ones. They intrigued me. It's sad that there were only a few scenes with them near the end of the story. 
 Now that you know more about the characters, it's very important to note that at the beginning of the story, Charlie is nothing but a job - a soul to collect - to Dante. Charlie was beneath him. He viewed her with condescension as if he is better than her because he is Adonis incarnate. This doesn't last long, however. It was fun seeing Dante start to care for her. Eventually, fell in love with her so hard he is willing to give everything up for her. This transition is slow and perfect, in my opinion. 
 So, no... there is no instalove here. The Dante-Charlie romance is a very slow developing romance. Instalove haters, this book is for you! 
 With respect to the reading enjoyment, I loved the first 20 per cent. I thought it was entertaining and cute. However, the next 20 per cent was just 'meh.' I had to read other books because I became frustrated with the events, and Dante was going nowhere in the story. Then the next 20 per cent was so-so. There were parts that were really good, but there were also parts that were... not. But things finally got better in the last 40 percent of the story. That's where everything happened - the action intensified and the romance bloomed. In simple words, the story took too long to unravel. 
 I've read a lot of good vs. bad, angels vs. demons books. Most of them, I really didn't like. I usually get bored with the plot as they are all similar in so many ways. You've read one, you've read them all. Plus, I hate it when fictional books get all preachy. There are only very few which I read until the very end, and this book is one of them. I recommend this book for fans of Personal Demons by Lisa Desrochers or Sweet Evil by Wendy Higgins!""",2013-02-18 16:22:51,"The Collector (Dante Walker, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;fiction,Victoria Scott

 LOVE: 
 First of all, I loved the atmosphere of the story. The town of Hemlock has an air of mystery and intrigue. I also love the characters in this book. Each one is imperfect, but is always striving to be better. This fact makes them real. Jason is so broken and lost after Amy's death. Kyle is frustrating, but heroic. Mac made some incredibly stupid decisions, but was able to redeem herself anyway. Those flaws made the characters human, and therefore the readers of this book would be able to relate to one or more of the characters. In relation to this, I loved the teenage hormonal drama behind the murder mystery story. This book dealt with issues about imperfect friendships: trust, betrayal, and lots of secrets and lies. Plus, there are also best friends slowly turning into something more than friends, and two best friends loving the one and the same girl. Truly, the drama in this book is fantastic! 
 NO LOVE: 
 There are very few things I disliked about this book. First, the book has this element: ""I'm a monster. I'm not good for you."" This is just so commonplace! Second, is the fact that Amy can communicate to Mac in her dreams. This was strange to me at first as a ghost story doesn't really go well with a werewolf story. I didn't know what to make of it. But I got used to it, and I realized later in the story that it wasn't as bad as I thought. 
 MUSINGS: 
 I am in love with this book! But I have to say that, there is really nothing unique about the werewolf lore in this book: people getting infected by the virus, people getting killed by a werewolf. Nevertheless, there is something special about the book as a whole. I believe this is due to the author's amazing writing and storytelling skills. I was hooked after reading the first paragraph. I couldn't stop reading because it was just completely addicting. Honestly, I didn't expect the book to be that good. It exceeded my expectations. I think it's a combination of the werewolf story in the The Dark Divine and the murder-mystery story in The Body Finder. This book is actually better than The Dark Divine! The plot is so wonderfully entangled and complicated! The suspense is a killer! Who is the wolf? Who is the killer? Is the wolf and the killer one and the same? As new characters are introduced, the reader would ask, is this character the wolf? While the romance in the story did not fully develop, there was an intense chemistry between potential love interest/s. The ending was very satisfying. The author was able to resolve the conflicts well, but left something to make the reader hungry for the sequel. And for a change, I am thrilled that there will be a sequel. Reading Hemlock was such a pleasure that I would gladly return to the world that Kathleen Peacock has created.""",2012-03-26 18:13:24,"Hemlock (Hemlock, #1)",young-adult;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction,Kathleen Peacock
2712,18745159,4,"""I received an advance copy from Net Galley in exchange for an honest review. 
 I finally got my hands on this book! The wait is over. 
 In Book 11 of the Elemental Assassin series, all Gin Blanco, aka ""The Spider"", wants is for the criminal underworld to leave her alone. But that all changes when a new, powerful drug is distributed on the streets. With the drug kingpin gearing up to take control of the corrupt city and stomp out ""the Spider"" at the same time, Gin certainly has some serious work ahead of her. But Gin is the assassin ""Spider"", and she has the patience to wait out her enemies to deliver the fatal strike. 
 Okay so my actual rating is 4.5 stars. I have to say that Jennifer Estep seems to be getting better with each book of this series. This is definitely one of my favorites in the series. I like how she briefly, yet effectively describes events that happened prior to this book for those who haven't read the previous books. There was a nice pacing in the story, and the action was very engaging. It was the perfect blend of action, romance, paranormal and comedy all wrapped up in one. The ending was kind of like... 
 I'm definitely ready for more. 
 Characters 
 Gin Blanco: I love, love, LOVE how feisty she is. One of my favorite things about this series, is her. Saying ""I love a strong female protagonist"" is the understatement of the century. She's her usual witty, brave, open-a-can-of-whoop-ass self that I have always enjoyed. And every time she defeats someone, I imagine her saying.. 
 Finn: OMG he is the comic relief of the series! He never fails to make me laugh every time. I need a Finnegan Lane in my life. 
 ""You have reached the always awesome, ever charming, and obscenely handsome Finnegan Lane,"" he chirped nin my ear. ""How may I be of service to you today?"" 
 Owen: Gin's ongoing love interest. I love how supportive he is of her. Also how he seems to know exactly what she needs. 
 ""Well,"" he said, ""I thought we would stay in and have a quiet evening. You, me a nice dinner, perhaps some quality time watching 
 TV in my bedroom."" 
 ""Watching TV? Really?"" 
 ""Well, if you absolutely insist, we can skip the TV-viewing portion of the evening,"" 
 JoJo and Sophia: Love the loyalty and love they show Gin. They're like her cheerleaders, but not quite as perky. 
 Bria: Ugh.. She irritated me in this one.

 Great Action

2713,8262550,5,"""What a great love story! I liked how this book took off from the beginning. The author writes a seamless story, showing us how Annie and Cord fall in love after being forced together by circumstances out of their control. This was not a case of insta-love, but a solid friendship that grew more intimate over time. Annie is forced out of her comfort zone right from the start, discovering an inner strength she didn't know she had. As time goes on, the couple slips into married life on the ranch, sharing the chores and working with the horses. They discover a happiness they did not expect. The partnership they develop was a beautiful thing, cozy and sweet. I LOVED the horse race, including Annie and Cord's teamwork prior to the race. I think it was a turning point in their relationship.  
 Cord was a strong character, very intelligent and witty, but quiet at first. Annie brought him out of his protective shell and he gave her the freedom to finally spread her wings. Together they brought the best out in each other. I wasn't sure I'd like Cord's family at first, but over time they won me over. Annie's family is a different story. Her father was a heartless brute and despite the happy ending, I still think Rob is a spineless coward. The last few chapters had me on the edge of my seat and then wrapped up very nicely. This is a book I'll re-read over the years.""",2014-06-15 22:40:45,"Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold (Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold, #1)",history;historical fiction;biography;romance;fiction,Ellen O'Connell

 seriously, if you're looking for a nice fluffy light cutesy squeeze your heart book.. this is not it. nope nope nope. 
 first off, i will say, i could not put this book down. so it's more like 4.5 stars but not quite 5 for me. i also think i enjoyed Revelry by this author more, like the actual reading was more enjoyable and fun than this book. this book was not fun. this book legit stomped on my heart, cuddled it, stomped on it again, cuddled... and on and on and on for almost 400 pages. that was not enjoyable my friends. that hurt. but i couldn't put it down. 
 this book has a lot of things i don't like. for one, he dates her best friend. they become friends while he's dating her best friend, and she likes him.. i just don't like that situation. the guy and best friend eventually break up (do you really need me to tag that as a spoiler?) and you think, oh finally.. except now she has a boyfriend. 
 i just am not a fan of the back and forth, the timing being wrong, the constant almost getting together but something silly being in their way. 
 i am also not a fan of cheating in books. nope nope nope. 
 what else? i think that's about it. i thought the reason whatshisname didn't call or communicate properly for 2 years was pretty weak. i thought the girl's reasoning for not being long distance was also pretty weak. i just wanted to smoosh them together and make them have a happy ending. 
 so with all these things i didn't like, or don't normally like, why did i like this book so much? i have no idea. i legit couldn't put it down, my heart was racing the entire time, i feel like my emotions went through the wringer 17 times and i just needed a hug really badly once i finished. you don't even know.

They have much in common and spend time together doing their own thing and, in time, they become best friends, too. But the lines always remain blurry between them. 
 ""We had always existed in the in-between, and I guessed we always would."" 
 As the years go by, they move in and out of the friend zone. The timing is NEVER right for them. However, no matter what life throws at her, Jamie was her whiskey - her addiction. They were never right, but they were never wrong either. They just were.

 This novel was passionate, electric and erotic! 
 ""Hearing her lyrical voice dripping like honey as she'd said my name was like the wall I'd put up around me splintered and lay at her feet."" 
 Killian 'Kite' Kane is something of a mystery. There is no shortage of women in his life, and rumours abound about his love of kink and piercings. However, no one really knows the real Kite - the real Killian, with his tragic past, except his closest friend, Logan/Sculpt. When a beautiful face from his past gatecrashes one of the band's concerts, eleven-year-old feelings come flooding back, and he realises that now she's found him, again, he cannot keep away from her. 
 ""If you come near me again, next time I won't let you go."" 
 He'd warned her when they were teenagers. Their connection is just as real as it had been back then. Savannah ' Savvy' Grady, a dance teacher, desperately needs a job, after the messy break-up with her ex-boyfriend, who was also her boss. As a last ditch attempt at landing a dancing gig in an exclusive nightclub, she approaches Killian to put in a good word for her with the boss of the nightclub, as she knows they're friends. However, Killian is against Savvy dancing at the club. That is, until he strikes a bargain with her. One month of fake-dating in exchange for dancing at the club. It was a win-win situation for Savvy, although she wasn't sure quite what Killian would get out of the arrangement, as it was well-known he didn't date and he didn't have girlfriends. Unfortunately, those pesky feelings interfere and what should have been an easy month of fake-dating turns into something passionate, irresistible, and very real. 
 ""It was dangerous, the way I felt about her. Powerful. Intense. Consuming. And yeah, it was obsessive."" 
 The chemistry between Killian and Savvy was electric! Killian is a complex man, carrying around haunting guilt, burning hatred, and undeniable love. He NEEDS Savvy in his life. He wanted her desperately - all of her. His orchid. ""Exotic. Graceful. Beautiful and strong. And one of the most coveted plants."" - she was all these things to him. I loved how possessive and protective he was of her. Savvy has been independent for so long out of necessity. She saw beyond his anger to the real guy beneath - she saw his ""good bits"". She needed him in her life just as much as he needed her. I loved how well she understood him, even though he kept himself closed off from her. 
 ""You're going to kiss me, Savvy. And when you do, there'll be no going back."" 
 God, this book was hot! The build-up to the main event was so sexy and erotic. And, the feels! Gah! I just loved Killian's intensity where Savvy was concerned.

Everything in this book felt so incredibly real and incredibly powerful and thought provoking. It makes you want to stand up and go and do something for someone or for the world as a whole.

2726,6598461,3,"""I have been a Caletti fan for a long time. She's an exceptional writer, and her books always have keen observations and a quirky, relatable cast of characters. The Six Rules of Maybe was no exception. It was so adorably Caletti, but the problem was, it was nothing more than that. All I enjoyed about this book were the characters and writing. 
 The plot, unfortunately, was dull and meandering. The initial set-up is like an indulgent Lifetime movie, full of drama and potential family blow-outs. But Caletti actually treated the situation realistically, making the story true to life, but it felt robbed of its deliciousness. If the background cast of characters hadn't been so absorbing, there would be no meat to this novel. Caletti's strength lays in the development and personalities of her characters, making her books seem more like character-studies. 
 But I certainly did enjoy this novel.

2730,28963772,5,"""4,5 Wild&Trouble Stars! Sweet captivating story. When I think about my emotions while reading it, it was a little bit of everything. And that's really what I like the most in books. All kinds of feelings, laugh, tears, anger and enormous love. 
 About the plot: It starts with a big mess for Sydney and her friend Tori. Syd leaves behind a house that she knew the past few years and goes to her friend. She is so angry at everything and wants to give a hard time to Tori's former boyfriend by phone. But she selects the wrong number... The man who listens to harsh words, is so intrigued that he decides to maintain contact with her. Brian has his own problems and the conversation with the girl helps him forget. They through these conversations formed a bond, help one other, and in the end also fall in love. But the closer they are to each other, the more difficult is to him makes an admission of his life errors. 
 ""Best two and a half weeks of my life came from a girl who was never meant to give me anything. And she was giving me everything."" 
 Some thoughts:I totally fell in love with the series after only the first book. And why is that? Because the heroes of this story are amazing, and they have a fantastic group of friends behind their backs. 
 From the very beginning their history is very addictive. You're intrigued and want more. It is difficult to break away from this book when you start it. The story fantastic develop and you can not not fall in love with their characters. I definitely did. They are madly good together, even if only by phone. It explodes when they are together and you really want to get to this point. 
 ""I'm going to give you Wild for the rest of your life and so much of it you won't have room to feel anything else."" 
 I love all those moments that lead to this, but perhaps even more when they are together. Then it is just so sweet and funny but also sexy as hell. Brian has a dirty mind and does not hesitate to use it. There are also moments that not only wet your panties, but also moisten your eyes. With a bit of tension and anxiety, the storyline has several layers and outside the wonderful love tells a story about forgiveness yourself the mistakes of the past. 
 ""One word that held so much and sounded so loud, and if it was written, I could read it forever."" 
 It all makes for me is that the book is a hit. I never before read J. Daniels, but if she writes so cool stories, I already know that I will have to catch up. I tear off small half a point for the slowdown after the middle of the book. But that's just it. Other than that, the book is a great read and the promise of another story from a group of friends, which we could quite well already explore, makes you want more and more. It promises to be a sensational series, such that I like the most.

2731,30164369,4,"""Well... this is taking a caveman way to a whole new level! The Alexa Riley Promises quickly becoming one of the best series of the authors. 
 Blackmailing the Virgin is a short story about a businessman Calder Cox. He is a powerful, arrogant and self-confident men. When he sees a girl who plays the violin on the balcony during a party, he is immediately dazzled by her and wants to possess her. Felicity is a nice girl who is not aware of her advantages. She has some problems with confidence and faith in herself. That comes from the fact that her infamy mother left her when she was young. Her whole life she was daddy's girl and lived with the consequences of the lack of a role model of woman. 
 Felicity and Calder share earth-shaking kiss on the balcony. But when it turns out that she is the daughter of his company's attorney, he forced himself to withdraw. He tries to forget her, but after some time when he sees her again, he couldn't control himself any longer. However, for the shy Felicity passionate night will not be the beginning of a great love, but will force her to face the changes. And Calder will make sure that she would be his forever. 
 Calder, that sexy beast, is big the cavemen of the word. He is grumpy and jealous of every glance at her. Do not take no for an answer. His moments of madness are pretty funny and mega sexy. Certainly not all women consider such methods as sexy. But there is something very exciting in these alpha males. And for sure when it is combined with a lot of affection and devotion. He can also use his attitude to give Felicity extreme pleasure in steaming scenes in bed. And at the same in the reader fantasies. Winks. Winks. 
 It's a standard set of possessive man and shy female. It gives you sexy mix with dirty side. And although it is still insta-love at its best from Alexa Riley, the action took place in the space of a few months. It adds some tension and develop the storyline in fantastic way. Not only smut but also heart melting story. 
 I found this book and the whole series as a very pleasant to read. There is something in those old romances what we like and what we miss for. I can't hide that I became a fan of these affairs and I hope for a lot more.

 Natalie Kovac and Asher (aka Ghost) Collins were hilarious. They both had walls up in order to protect themselves from heartbreak. Natalie believed she was broken and Asher/Ghost thought he didn't know how to love due to his childhood and upbringing. But once they got together, it was electric. First as friends, then as lovers, then as much much more. 
 I loved how fiercely Natalie and Asher would defend each other against anyone they thought would or could hurt the other. Even when Nat was emotionally hurting when Asher went away, she still went after someone she thought could hurt him. I loved how Asher took care of Cole, and though it wasn't that type of book, I was curious about the darker side of Ghost. The man who almost seemed to get off on hurting someone. 
 They made me laugh to the point of clutching my stomach and trying to breath in many parts of the book, all the way to the end. And they made me tear up a little with some of their heartbreak. But this was hands down better than the first book. I did keep waiting for the other shoe to drop because so many dropped in the first book in this series.

 This is such a lovely, uplifting, magical book. 
 It seems numerous people found it disappointing after The Book Thief, which I read too long ago to compare. All I can advise is not to expect the exact same of an author. His other book's aside, Zusak creates wonderful characters here and his writing is beautifully poetic - it needs to be appreciated in its own right rather than in comparison to any other of his books. 
 Firstly, the opening chapter of this book is genius. It's one of the best openings to a book I've ever read. The plot is constantly moving and is paced perfectly so the story never runs dry and I always felt compelled to keep going. The ending I found unconvincing, but I'm trying not to let that spoil the rest of the book, which was otherwise consistently brilliant. 
 Ed and his friends - Marv, Ritchie and Audrey - are all very well crafted characters, with just the right quirks to make them interesting and realistic. Ed himself does a lot of lovely things in this book, but he is far from the dreaded Gary-Stu. He makes a lot of mistakes and struggles a lot of uncertainty and personal issues. He's sarcastic and clever, and he doesn't always know what the right thing to do is. Also, he treats his dog excellently. I didn't know the relationship between a man and his dog could be so perfectly written! 
 At the core of the story is a beautiful message about little acts of kindness, and, as it says, 'small things that are big.' 
 Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of.""",2015-06-06 15:18:01,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak
2742,19057,4,"""3.5/5 stars, but hedging much closer to 4 than 3. 
 I am in love with The Book Thief. Seriously, hopelessly in love. It tears my heart out, makes me cry, makes me laugh, makes me feel. This was perhaps to my detriment in reading I Am the Messenger. While I expected them to be unalike in subject (ie/ not a historical fiction), I did have some subconscious expectation of them being at least somewhat alike in some other way -- style perhaps? The feel I get from the words? While there are certainly moments that feel ""Zusak-y"" (he seems a fan of pairing up unlikely and unexpected things in lists) I would not have been able to peg these two books as having been written by the same author. Honestly that diversity in writing style and subject is probably to Zusak's benefit (who wants to be boxed into one style?), and me pointing it out is not even a proper critique, it's just something that people should be aware of going into it. 
 Now, my first ""critique"" critique has to do with the inconsistent tone. The first chapter is, undoubtedly, setting us up for the expectation that we're about to read a satire. The language is heightened, and Marv and Ed have a full-on argument about Marv's awful car while the bank they're in is being held up by the most inept and slap-stick bank robber imaginable, whom Ed thwarts. What ensues thereafter becomes more like a standard mystery: Ed receives, one by one, an ace card from every suit. Each ace has three clues on it corresponding to three specific people whom Ed is charged with making their lives better. This section is highly grounded in realistic imagery and is necessarily heavy on description. I honestly found this to be quite enjoyable, as Zusak has a great way of integrating descriptions of the city into the storyline, a technique allowed to him by his premise. The hints of absurdist satire are mostly gone, except at the point where Ed receives a gun in his mailbox as part of a message, though the hint of it is subverted and made serious/realistic once more based on how Ed decides to use it. 
 It's when the last suit is visited -- hearts -- that the tone changes a second time, this time to existential and poetic metaphorical language. It's beautiful, but so deviant from the realism of what preceded it that its presence almost confused me. I will say though that this last fourth of the book is my favorite, as its gorgeously written and closer to the style I was expecting. The metafictional turn that the ending of the book took really won me over. So, on the one hand I have to point out the bothersomeness of the tonal shift, but on the other hand, what it shifted to was personally preferable to me. I wish that more of the book had been in that style, because especially within the first two suits, I got a little snoozy at some parts. I honestly think the ""surprise"" ending was great, and the last two lines were very wisely chosen. 
 So, all in all, while a bit tonally inconsistent, I did enjoy this. I would recommend it, but would warn people not to have any preconceived expectations for it.""",2016-09-26 13:58:02,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal,Markus Zusak
2743,186074,5,"""In the present day, the main character Kvothe is in disguise as an innkeeper in a rural town. At the same time that strange, deadly creatures begin attacking townspeople, a Chronicler comes into town looking for Kvothe in order to chronicle the tale of the extraordinary life that led him to his status as a figure of legend. Though reluctant at first, Kvothe agrees on the terms that he be allowed three days to recount his life. As the first of three books, this is the first day of his tale, spanning from his days as a child in a travelling troupe to his teenage years in a university, studying magic. 
 It's possible that this is one of the best written books in the entire world. I'll elaborate: for me, there are four main categories that really make books excel or fall behind, and since this book nails all of them I'll go through them below It's worth saying first though that this book conquered every fear or misgiving I had about it, the main one being the flashback component. Usually, I find books told in flashback to be missing a certain amount of urgency, but this one isn't at all. I'll address this further in 'plot'. 
 +World: Fully realized. I mean this in the same sense that Westeros is fully realized in the Song of Ice and Fire series. First, it's obvious that the author has an extremely developed map of the world in his head, and he walks us through many of the different segments of this world seamlessly, from forest paths to vastly different neighborhoods of urban cities to backwater towns to university buildings. Not only does Rothfuss send us to these places with incredible detail about the physical land, but he is continuously relating nuances of the world to us through the characters that exist in these various parts, in everything from their actions to the way they speak. Doing this is hard enough, but Rothfuss also seamlessly sets up the rules for his world in regards to the existence of magic and the legendary nightmare figures the Chandrian. 
 +Character: It's so very easy for a character to feel like a character, if that makes sense. For them to feel like they exist for the purpose of the story, or to move along the story of the main character. But every character in this book is whole in the same way that the world is. We get the sense that every character here is the protagonist of their own story, in spite of the fact that everything is being told to us through Kvothe's voice. Each character feels completely distinct from one another, and completely fleshed out. If a character enters a scene, Rothfuss never forgets they're in the room. I felt like I knew each of them. 
 +Pacing: This is a loooooong book. Not only is it a long book, but it also has a present and a past storyline, a multitude of characters, universal rules that are new to the reader, and spans multiple years and many cities as the main character moves around. Unlike some other epic fantasies, we spend the entire book with Kvothe, not dodging in and out of other storylines. Somehow, Rothfuss has made this nearly 700 page book go by as quickly as a 300 page book, and that's a skill. It's full of these mini story-arcs that build on one another, each adding bits of new information that continue to build the story as a whole. 
 +Plot: INTRICATE. As I said, Rothfuss uses mini story-arcs to tell Kvothe's tale. While I'm usually skeptical of flashback stories, it succeeds in this book for two reasons: one, to serve as a break between the story-arcs, a little change of pace to keep the reader on their toes; and two, there's another fully developed storyline in the present timeline that we're moving through as well. In between the flashbacks, we return to Kvothe the innkeeper as he tells his tale to the Chronicler. Though we don't know exactly what's happening in the present world, it's clear that these strange supernatural attacks are related to Kvothe's past, which we're finding out in slow increments, providing even more urgency to keep reading. 
 Usually, I don't like flashbacks because we know the main character is safe at the end of the tale. Rothfuss completely diverts this, both by making us extremely invested in the characters surrounding past-Kvothe, and making it clear that Kvothe and his surroundings are still in danger in the present, and that he's been damaged somehow for the worse. 
 I'm awed by how Rothfuss has so neatly laid out the threads of his plot that the reader doesn't even realized they've been primed for later pieces of the story until those pieces come. The denner resin comes to mind specifically -- early in the story, I didn't realize it was a plot point and instead assumed it was another detail of a fully rounded world. Later, everything we're seeded with early on about resin comes full circle. And this is only one of many examples. 
 I'm both excited and terrified to read the next book in this series. I know it won't disappoint me, because Rothfuss has gained my full confidence, but I'm terrified to be caught up to the number of books that have been published!""",2014-03-13 18:03:48,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 Can a novel published only a year ago become a classic? All the Light We Cannot See sure has that ""feel"", quality about it. I also think this would make a great book to be studied in high-school or college/university. 
 I'm only going to jot down a few things, as there are so many wonderful reviews on Goodreads. 
 There were so many things I loved about All the Light We Cannot See. 
 This novel is so layered, so thorough and is also very touching without being sappy. 
 The writing, while relatively simple, is exquisite. I loved the third person narrative and I didn't mind at all the alternate POVs or the very quirky, small chapters that were popping here and there. 
 This novel is so high on details, it's hard not to imagine yourself on the streets of Paris, or walking through the Natural History Museum, or strolling the streets of the quaint, seaside town of Saint-Malo. 
 The descriptions were extremely vivid. At times, I felt as if I was suffering from synaesthesia - where senses get somewhat amalgamated and mixed up - you associate colour to numbers or smells to touching certain textures. Beautifully olfactory as times, Doerr manages to make us ""see"" what Marie-Laure was ""seeing"". 
 The character development is absolutely exquisite. You'll be hard pressed not to love the two young protagonists - Marie - Laure, who's a blind French girl, and Werner Pfennig- a German orphan, who ends up becoming a soldier in the German army, despite not being of age. 
 Their innocence is taken by the war. They're thrown into situations none of them would have ever imagined. 
 The love and dedication of Marie-Laure's father were quite touching. He was an intelligent man, a dotting single father, who was trying to make his blind daughter's life as easy as possible. One of the things he comes up with is a miniature town that he painstakingly builds so that she can learn her way around their neighbourhood. 
 I also enjoyed, or better said, appreciated Doerr's take on the Nazis. By telling us about Werner's history as a little boy, Werner enrolled in an elite school, Werner's struggles during the war, Doerr humanised him, so he no longer was just a Nazi. Most books on the subject, vilify, make unredeemable monsters of all the Germans. Surely, they were not all bad. What they did as a collective was atrocious! But, most people, taken as individuals, are quite decent beings. Only when put together with others, that's when things change. It's an interesting, somewhat puzzling characteristic of human behaviour, that makes otherwise decent people act/behave like ... I won't say animals, as that would be derogatory towards the animals. Just watch young men (and not only) together on a night in town. Then add the will to conform and belong, circumstances, propaganda, patriotism, fear, youth and a few other things, and you've got yourself a group of monsters. 
 I loved how music, and science, and reading sort of connected two people that were supposed to be enemies. 
 Anyway, I'll end this review by saying All The Light We Cannot See is deserving of all the accolades. I'm glad I got to read it. This is one of those books that begs to be re-read. 
 I've received this novel via NetGalley. Many thanks to HarperCollins UK, HarperPress/4th Estate/The Friday Project for allowing me to read and review this tremendous novel.

2766,186074,5,"""Re-read review. 
 A story about a story about stories. 
 I remember being completely blown away by this book when I read it first, and so approached this re-read with a mix of anticipation and anxiety. The first quarter or so of the book is a lot of establishing shots, and I was afraid that I was going to be disappointed. But once the story gets going proper, I found the feeling that I remembered. 
 Kote is the owner proprietor of the Wayside Inn, a well stocked and maintained pub that is nevertheless located in a very out of the way village, and is poorly patronised. Together with his one employee Bast, Kote goes through the motions of life, rarely catering to more than four or five local regulars. But Kote, and Bast too, are more than they appear, as becomes apparent when a stranger makes his way to the Wayside seeking Kote's story. And what a story it turns out to be, replete with music, danger, adventure, dragons, evil men, magic, beautiful women and at it's heart, a mystery. Too much to be told in a single night. Or, it transpires, a single volume. 
 While the plot is engaging, the world intriguing and the characters are well drawn and complex, I think it is the quality of the prose which really set this book apart from other fantasy stories I have read. While there are a handful of times when it could be argued the author is trying *too* hard (like the bookendy opening and closing sections), all in all this book reads like a labour of love which has been polished to perfection by a true craftsman.""",2014-03-21 00:34:17,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

The entire book was pretty much Layla discovering she hadn't been told something, finding out more about it (for example, researching and looking at a website in one case), freaking out, and then having the cycle repeat.

2768,11930007,4,"""This one is by far the most well developed and it contains the plot for segment of episodes from SMC that I liked the most. I flew though it, because the episodes are still fresh in my mind. 
 May contain spoilers! Read at your own risk! 
 I can't really say much about this volume aside from the fact that up until this point, Chibiusa is my favorite character of the Manga and SMC. Just the way in which she is presented and introduced makes her stand out. Unlike SMO Chibiusa from SMC/manga has a really nice character design and she does feel like a kid that is desperate to find a way to save her parents. She does feel lonely and helpless and she does not come off as bratty. Most of the times I feel sorry for her and when she gave up and went with Wiseman, I felt like she did her best and all she could do was quit because, she's done everything humanly possible and nothing worked. 
 Chibiusa is a great character, and if they managed to nail her, then I'm waiting to see what happens in the manga with Uranus, Neptune and Hotaru and see how they get adapted. 
 OMG!!! 5 more episodes and Sailor Moon R part is finished. We're going into Sailor Moon S. I have some predictions about it: 
 1. SMC does not have the menacing atmosphere Sailor Moon S had, thus it will fail when it comes to the atmosphere. 
 2. It will not nail Uranus and Neptune. 
 3. It will not convey Chibiusa and Hotaru's friendship in a believable manner. 
 4. (Most important) The last episode WILL NOT be memorable in the way episode 125 was (< btw ep. 125 is one of the most memorable episodes in the whole of the SMO series).

2771,186074,4,"""3.5 stars, but I rounded up. 
 This book has had the misfortune of being described as a book similar to the Harry Potter series - or even the next Harry Potter which is just an even bigger curse. The problem being, of course, that anything compared to this series can never quite live up to the magic. A comparison like that sets a book up to be just short of impressive. I knew this going in, so I tried to read at as an independent book. This worked out fine because it wasn't really anything like Harry Potter. Sure, he goes to a university that has some vague similarities to Hogwarts - but they are minor enough to be coincidental. It isn't even clear whether he's studying magic! Plus, he doesn't get to the university until about 230 pages or so into the book. 
 In it's own right, this book was interesting. It was also compared to 1001 Arabian Nights, another comparison I'm not quite sure fits. Yes, it is a story within a story, but it doesn't have the same set up to really be a comparison. Essentially, Kvothe (pretending to be Kote the innkeeper) is found by Chronicler who sits down to write Kvothe's story. The story is told in a flashback in Kvothe's own words, with occasional interspersion of the ""present day"" events in the inn. I had a hard time getting into the beginning of the book, but Kvothe's flashback story was interesting. The issue that I had with this book was the way that it skipped around from story to story. Half the time, stories are mentioned - or, even more frustratingly, only half told - then forgotten. Only to be mentioned - or, if the reader is very lucky, to be fully explained - later in the story. This was confusing, and it didn't help that the characters randomly switch into other, presumably made-up by Rothfuss, languages without a translation provided to the poor reader. The story was interesting enough to hold my attention though, and I will finish the trilogy.""",2011-08-31 21:35:33,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance,Patrick Rothfuss

 Brian Savage where have you been all my life? 
 I went into Four Letter Word knowing absolutely nothing about this novel. Let me tell you... 
 Brian and Sydney are a book couple force to be reckoned with. 
 There are so many aspects in this novel that I loved. 
 The first is obviously the couple this story is about, Brian and Sydney. I loved the way their relationship started with Sydney calling to bitch out Tori's two timing ex only to find out she dialed the wrong number. I laughed so hard because of this scene. Damn, that is embarrassing. 
 I also loved the fact the first half of the book was Brian and Sydney communicating only via text and phone calls. That brought to the surface an even stronger emotional connection between the two. It wasn't all about lust. It was actually a slow build friendship that eventually became a relationship. 
 Sydney felt safe discussing her ex husband and their marriage issues with Brian. Normally I would find this weird but the way it was written I found it endearing and heartwarming. I actually swooned over Brian Savage. 
 I loved the two separate stories and how they merged. 
 While the two were connecting via text they also had their own issues going on. Brian was living with guilt and working a shitty job that he wanted nothing to do with, to try to ease this guilt. Trust me ladies when you find out the reason for Brian's guilt you will completely lose it. Poor guy. When he officially started texting Sydney he decided that job was not fair to her, and even only talking to her twice he wanted to do right by her and gave it up. *Another swoon worthy moment*. 
 While Brian was going through his issues, Sydney was living with the fact that her ex husband wasn't the man she thought he was and trying to move on with her life and getting back to the woman she used to be. 
 I loved the moment Brian and Sydney.....FINALLY.....lock eyes with one another. 
 Complete and Total SWOON! 
 But with every perfect book couple, sometimes looks can be deceiving. When Sydney finds out Brian has been keeping a huge secret that has the ability to destroy the perfectly blissful relationship they built, Brian makes it his life mission to make all of his *mishaps* disappear. Then and only then Sydney has to choose whether she can trust Brian and move on from this issue or disappear from Brian's life completely, because frankly we all know that Brian would never let Sydney go unless she forced the issue and disappeared. 
 This novel not only had a kick ass slow build relationship between Sydney and Brian, but it also included an amazing friendship between Sydney and Tori. Actually I wouldn't call it a friendship, it was more like a sisterhood. I loved the way Tori and Sydney had each others back no matter what. Those two are very inspiring when it comes to friendships in novels. 
 I cannot believe it took me this long to read Four Letter Word. If you're like me and was scared to read this because of all the hype that surrounded it when it first released, do not, I repeat do not hesitate to pick Four Letter Word up and give it a go.

 Okay. Major fangirl attack over. Sorry about that. 
 So, I guess it's pretty obvious I absolutely loved this book, right? Just in case it's not, I'll just say it. I loved this book. It was so sweet, emotional and heartbreaking. It was pure awesomeness! 
 I admit I was a little worried when I first found out it would be about Stephanie. We didn't get off to a great start in Wait for You, and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to like her, but when I finished Fall with Me, I warmed up to it. I was also super-excited to get to read more about Nick, I found him really interesting in Stay with Me and Fall with Me. And I warmed up to Steph. Actually, I have to say she's an awesome character. She just felt so right, somehow. 
 I also loved Nick. As I already said, he's a very interesting character. He's got some baggage, yes, but he's totally swoon-worthy. Honestly, I don't understand how JLA can write about so many perfect, absolutely swoon-worthy guys. Where does she get her ideas? 
 There are obviously attraction between the two of them, from the very moment they meet. And neither of them are in the business of ignoring or denying their attraction to each other. 
 It was actually pretty refreshing to read about Steph, who supports one-night-stands, but still believes in love. Way too often, you read about overly innocent characters, and I'm happy to know JLA can write about a character who actually has some experience. I feel like it is not really accapted for girls to have one-night-stands, and that they should be super innocent and have seriously zero experience, but it's okay for guys. That is so wrong and sexist, and what happened to gender equality and not making a difference between the genders? 
 ""I was a hundred percent full supporter of no-strings-attached hookups. However, I never understood, and never would, the double standard that existed. It was okay for the guys to take charge of their pleasure, but not women? 
 Not in my world."" 
 Let's just take a moment to appreciate the awesomeness of Steph, this quote, and JLA, for mentioning these important subjects in her books. 
 I could write a full essay about this subject, but since this is supposed to be a review, I'll settle for saying that it's important and that I love JLA for this book. 
 Let's get back to talking about Nick and Steph. Their relationship starts with a one-night-stand, and those of you who've read the previous books in Wait for You series know how he feels about hookups, so you can imagine his reaction when Steph walks right back into Mona's. For those of you who haven't, basically, he doesn't see the girls after a hookup, like, ever again. 
 Then something brings them together, and suddenly they have to spend time together. It was really great to watch them grow closer throughout the book. It was such a sweet and emotional love story that had me hooked from the first page. 
 There was also another, not-so shocking, new about Avery and Cam, which ended with a fangirl attack of epic proportions. Forever with you might be my favorite book so far in this series. I don't know how Jennifer can keep surprising you. When you think it can't get any betger, she writes something like this, and you're just struck speechless. 
 As usual, the writing is good, the plot is interesting, the characters are awesome, and I'm in love. For the first time ever, I wish there was a way to go back in time, because I want to read Forever with You for the first time again.

 I thoroughly enjoyed the storytelling, and even if Kvothe had his ""me, me, me"" moments, at least his Mary Sue traits are justified because he does have actual troubling times he has to survive throughout the first third of his saga. So, I'll give him that. Rothfuss knows how to spin a good yarn. 
 The only real complaint? The passiveness of Denna. Yes, this is told from Kvothe's POV, and yes, this is merely the first installment and perhaps she'll have a more active role later. However, I feel Rothfuss could've thrown Denna a bone here and there. This particular door stop is nearly 700 pages, so you're telling me there's no room for Denna to share that she's got some survival traits of her own? 
 She ditches town a lot, meaning she travels a lot. She explains to Kvothe that she's a ""city girl"" on and on, but you're telling me she has no idea how to take care of herself when she has to travel through more rural towns? Maybe she does know how, but it isn't believable within the text we're given. I mean, she immediately starts chewing on the druggy resin when they're tracking the dracus, and even as a city girl, I would think she'd know about that particular resin and NOT immediately stick a foreign substance in her mouth anyways. She lets Kvothe cook, so I have no idea if she knows how to do it herself or if she's used to men taking care of meals for her, but yeesh. She sings, she's pretty, but she ditches a lot. I was actually angry that she left him on his own after he defeated the Dracus. He spends his time concerned that she's mad at HIM, and that makes no fucking sense. She ditched without checking on his well-being. She shows up whenever it's convenient to spice up Kvothe's plot, and I have to side with Kvothe's friends on this one - I don't understand his attraction to her yet. 
 I mean, he already has three other more interesting ladies vying for his attention and his money lender lady is my personal ship. Anyone knows that Kvothe's real true love is his lute. Just give me more descriptions about how Kvothe cares for his lute, and I'll be satisfied.

2789,14064,5,"""Richard Matheson wrote I am Legend in 1954. Arguably, it might be the first well known horror story in which a scientific explanation was given for vampirism. This alone makes I am Legend a classic in the genre of horror. To some extent, it might even be the induction of horror into the age of secularism, moving away from demons and devils and rather looking at the human condition or the morality of scientific warfare at the time. 
 In addition, as the story progresses, the questions seem to move away from superstition to a more enlightened brand of reasoning. It makes for an interesting character arc, as the main character continues to educate himself by questioning his own understanding of his world. To an extent, I am Legend is reminiscent of the life of Socrates, up to his trial where he was forced to drink poison. In a recent movie based on the book, it feels as if the script writers missed this. 
 I'm not sure I am Legend can be called a novel. The book is about 160 pages thick and might be around 25,000 to 30,000 words long. Generally, something like that would be called a novella. Nevertheless, Richard Matheson delivered with this story a work of fiction that arguably influenced every zombie novel or movie ever since. 
 The funny part is that I am Legend really doesn't have anything to do with zombies. In fact, even the movie, in which Will Smith played the lead, almost completely departed from the premise in the book. The main character in I am Legend, written by Matheson, has no real idea what is going on. He seems to assume the creatures that populate the post apocalyptic world are vampires. He is not a scientist and there is no mention that he has a military background. In fact, his ignorance becomes quite apparent. He believes in supernatural explanations. 
 That is until he realises that some weapons used to kill the so-called vampires, such as crucifixes, shouldn't really work on vampires who were never affiliated with the Christian religion to begin with, like Hindu vampires for instance. 
 At this point he starts looking for scientific reasons for vampirism. 
 This is indeed a major theme in the book, which is more or less ignored in the movie. 
 It is sometimes interesting to see how Hollywood can take a novel and turn it into something different, for Matheson's book takes a definite different approach to the story as far as theme is concerned. The book is certainly more thought provoking.  
 Stephen King, George A. Romero and Ann Rice have all admitted Matheson's influence on their work, which should serve as evidence what a great writer he was. Perhaps his greatest strength in this work was his ability to tell the story in such depth from the point of view of the character. Written in first person, Matheson takes the reader into the mind of the character as he wanders the empty streets of the city during the day and hides in his house during night. 
 We see how the character begins to doubt the morality of his own decisions and actions and how he comes to realize that the time of man has gone. There's action and tension and horror. 
 What I like about Matheson is that he manages to convey so much through writing simple actions. There is constant movement in this book, and it's very easy to visualize the world. 
 I highly recommend this book to all fans of horror. It is indeed a classic.""",2014-05-16 15:52:18,I Am Legend,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;mystery;thriller;crime,Richard Matheson

2797,18690890,4,"""After having read a couple of books by Green now, I thought I knew what to expect. Even though his books are good they follow a similar pattern which begins to make them predictable. Paper Towns broke out of this pattern and was even better for doing so. 
 Similar to when I read Dan Brown's books I felt awed at the skill of the characters in firstly being able to set the clues up and secondly for being able to solve the clues. However, I feel greater awe for the author who has had to think each of the clues through and work out just how everything pieces together. They then have to present this in such a way that they don't lose the reader along the way. That is an impressive skill. 
 I enjoyed the start of the story where Margo was around and going on the midnight rampage with Q. Then it was really intriguing as they gathered the clues that Margo had left behind. However the story then got a tad boring as Q was moping around unable to find anything else to lead him to Margo. However the final road trip to discover her was really interesting. 
 I was unsure how the book would end, I figured that Q would track down Margo eventually but I didn't know what would happen then; I couldn't even decide if she would be dead or alive. I thought that she might return home once she was found, but as you got to know Margo better even that seemed unlikely.  The actual ending was quite good in that it concluded in such a way that it was a great ending that didn't contradict any of the characters that had been built up throughout the story.

It could be read as a stand-alone book, with a lack of a cliff hanger that makes you eager for the next in the series 
 The book is classed as suitable for reader over the age of eleven, which is probably due to the minor references to sex and reproduction and the fact that someone gets shot and nearly drowned.

 This was honestly one of the best books I've read in my entire life. It was so simple, in so many ways. It was a massive riddle hidden in the most mundane form.

 I've been dying to get into a cute contemporary of late, it feel like it has been ages since I picked up a title to make me smile and tug on my heart strings, and so 'The Comeback Season' jumped out at me from the shelf. But comparatively, this books was sweet but dull. 
 If you are not a baseball fan, or a sports fan for that matter, 'The Comeback Season' may feel a bit slow, the narrative is bogged down with statistics and aspects of the game. For me, that's what happened, and found myself skimming forward frequently. I had read a number of reviews that have stated the same opinion, but I just had to find out for myself given how much I enjoyed other titles by Jennifer E. Smith. 
 Although our protagonist, Ryan, and her love interest Nick are relatable, there was nothing outside of the baseball connection that had me particularly relating with them. But I must admit, they make a really cute couple and I definitely ship them Overcoming their personal obstacles in an unassuming manner to discover the truth under their noses was endearing. 
 This book talks a lot about loss, and what happens after. And despite the fact that I too have lost a parent not too long ago, the book failed to draw the raw emotion to the surface. And that bothered me. I did however, shed a tear from a scene from Ryan's childhood and the loss of her dog. That was heartbreaking and beautifully written. 
 I loved the note this book finished on - in true contemporary style, and is worth the read just to get to that destination. 
 We touch on some girl politics and friendships in high school, and it was a great relief to see them have great depth and evolve throughout the novel, avoiding the trap of a two-dimensional character... well done Smith! 
 For an unassuming book it has a lot to say. I truly wish I had connected with the book more, but by the end the narrative felt clunky and some of the symbolism, a little cliche. So, this juxtaposed with the beauty of Jennifer E Smith's prose left me with an unsatisfied feeling from what I have gotten out of her other titles. 
 I think if there wasn't so much baseball in the content I would have enjoyed 'The Comeback Season' a lot more, despite its authenticity, and rated it much higher.

But Logan believes that the Mark may be more than that, and that getting it is what killed his sister. With strange noises and shadows hovering in the corners, Logan is slowly being consumed with suspicions. There is something about him that has not only a group of society out to possibly kill him, but another on a mission to keep him alive. Swipe has you falling into Logan's paranoia and constant questioning of the motives of everyone he meets. 
 Stories centered on young boys, aren't my usual read, but the cover of Swipe reminded me of Unwind by Neal Shusterman which I enjoyed, so I wanted to give it a try. This book is definitely geared for a younger male audience, more of a higher middle grade novel. There is little to no romance and is focused more on the mystery of what is going on with Logan. I actually thought the fact that Erin and Logan stay in the friend zone, makes the ending all that better. All of the characters make choices that make sense, even if they are unexpected. Angler introduces a lot of issues that teens face as they transition from elementary into middle school and beyond; the way relationship change, how hormones come into play, interfering with friendships, and how with a little knowledge you could question everything you thought you knew about the world and the people around you. 
 Angler throws in a few twists that really surprised me and each lead nicely towards a sequel. I could definitely see reading more of the series.

 Ahhh, this book made me so happy (despite the slow start). It was a growing up book - both for Rachel, and the story itself. A turning point book; a book where things started to settle, take a more definite new direction, set the scene for the epicness to come. Everyone started to get more depth and character, to show - and accept - their personalities and quirks, to play their roles in the story, to work together and move things forward. Like I mention in my updates, I'm in awe of Kim Harrison's way of crafting and layering everything - from character traits, to dialogue, humor, twists and story plots. So much depth, progress and finesse, all made in a very subtle, realistic way. Genius! (I still want to be her when I grow up). 
 The scenes with Al, Jenks and Trent were priceless. Some of my favorites in the entire series. They still make me giggle. :D 
 Also, this was a book where Kim showed her evil author side. In the last 20% of the book, she made me laugh out loud until my sides hurt, get so frustrated I almost threw my device across the wall AND drown in a sea of emotion until I had tears streaming down my face and wanted to crawl into a corner and hide from it all. And it was pure gold. 
 The only thing that got on my every last nerve was Rachel and her choices when it came to the men in her life. Not a fan of either Marshal or Pierce, and they're not that much better than Nick in my opinion.

The main character seemed to be effortlessly good at everything he does, and yet some mysterious failure or loss in his past has led to him going into early retirement and ""waiting to die"" -- what this failure or loss is will presumably be revealed in a later book, because there's no explanation in this one. Obviously something needs to be left for later books, but without this explanation the character is just annoying Every challenge he faces seems unconvincing, as does his personality for the age he's supposed to be --a barely-educated teenager talking like an academic? It seems to be a conflict between wanting to make him a genius and making him exceptionally young for a student of magic.

There were times where I was so frustrated, I wanted to throw my Kindle across the room. It was painful, raw, intense, and addicting. UUGGGHHH seriously, this book left me wounded. 
 You just have to read it. Don't try to find out what happens, just read. Let B tell you her story.""",2016-11-14 19:18:12,A Love Letter to Whiskey,romance;young-adult,Kandi Steiner
