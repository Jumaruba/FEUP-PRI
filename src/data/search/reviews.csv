0,19398490,4,"""A beautiful story. It is rare to encounter a book that does such a good job painting the scenes in your mind - you really felt like you were there and got to know the characters and the people they came across. I generally love WWII books and movies, but wasn't sure if I'd like one featuring a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator - but he brings a lot of life to them. 
 That said, the novel drifts around a lot, and the plotline jumping forward and backward in time drove me nuts. 
 I thought a lot about if there is a theme to the book. One was the diamond and if it was really cursed (based on the Hope Diamond perhaps?). Another is that 20K Leagues is an awesome book. But I think the book was a lot about fear and the unknown, and how people deal with it. Marie-Laure was blind and couldn't tell what was happening around her - yet she was the bravest one. Werner was afraid of ending up as a miner, which drove him to join the army, and learn about radios. And Uncle Etienne was afraid dying from a sniper he couldn't see, so he didn't leave his house and he created a radio transmitter. So the moral of the story is... don't be paralyzed by your fears. 
 This, she realizes, is the basis of his fear, all fear. That a light you are powerless to stop will turn on you and usher a bullet to its mark.""",2016-01-03 21:20:46,All the Light We Cannot See,"fiction,history,historical fiction,biography,young-adult"

 So sweet!! Filled with tons of romance and some real emotion. Don't read any spoilers for this book! I'm glad I didn't know anything about it. 
 Renee Carlino's books ALWAYS captivate me. 'Swear on This Life' is one of my all-time favorite stories. I will say that Adam is definitely my favorite thing about this book. *SIGH* Adam is one of the most memorable characters ever created by Ms. Carlino. Impulsive, sweet, charming, creative and loving, he really puts himself out there when he meets Charlotte. While I'm not always a fan of insta-love, it just WORKED here. Charlotte opened up her heart to Adam because he seemed, well, absolutely perfect. 
 I was absolutely enchanted by Adam and could understand how Charlotte fell for him. But life has a funny way of working out and things don't turn out quite how Charlotte expected. There was definitely something off about Adam right from the beginning but I couldn't put my finger on it. 
 ""You're stunning and beautiful and I loved every second of it. I'm sorry you didn't like it. Did I hurt you.?"" 
 ""No, but are you going to paint it?"" 
 ""Paint what?"" 
 ""Us, what we just did?"" 
 ""No."" 
 ""No?"" 
 ""No. I don't need to. I'll never forget it and it's sacred."" 
 The story took a lot of twists and turns and it was definitely one that I was not expecting!! Charlotte has had terrible luck at relationships and let's just say that Adam does not turn out to be everything she expected or imagined. Nonetheless, he still feels like the one love of her life, even though they spent a very short time together. 
 Life moves on and Charlotte gets back in to the dating scene. She meets the adorable Seth, who is a minor-league baseball player. He really likes her but she can't quite forget Adam. Seth is patient and sexy and athletic and funny and smart and is just an all-around wonderful man!! But can Charlotte move on from her brief time with Adam? 
 It was like we already knew each other, like we had met in a previous life. Memories that didn't exist began exploding in my mind like fireworks. 
 This is a lovely, romantic, bittersweet story filled with wonderful life lessons about healing and loving. I also adored all of the characters. This is not at all a love triangle (although I love those, too!). Don't read any spoilers about this one, you will enjoy the book so much more going in blind. The conclusion was just lovely and as always with Renee Carlino's stories, I was sorry to see this one end! 
 ""I want you to know that I am grateful to you. I'm grateful to you now. I got to experience IT in this life, and I don't think it's measured with time."" 
 ""You don't think what's measured with time, Adam?"" 
 ""Love, Charlotte.""

2,28963772,4,"""You're the best mistake I've ever made."" 
 'Four Letter Word' (clever title, no?) was everything I expect from J. Daniels: sweet and funny banter mixed with THE hottest romance and deeply-felt emotion. Brian and Sidney's story was unexpectedly dramatic but completely readable and satisfying! 
 Brian and Sidney meet by accident in the funniest way. Their surprise connection and relationship then develops via text messages and phone calls, BUT it really worked for me! Sidney is completely devastated and betrayed as the story begins, so she will she ever learn to trust another man again? Even one as ""perfect"" as Brian Savage? 
 ""I needed you, but I didn't know I needed you until you reached out to me."" 
 As with all of J. Daniels books, the hero and heroine and totally relatable and very ""real"". They have regular jobs, very good friends and and just came across as very down-to-earth. The secondary characters here were all wonderful: great supportive friends who stood by Brian and Sidney through everything! 
 Brian was a fantastic, sexy, dirty-talking Alpha with a sweet and loving and sensitive side. He and Sidney have fantastic chemistry and I was rooting for them to make things work. I absolutely loved how Brian always tried to do the right thing and be the perfect man for Sidney. He made some terrible sacrifices and poor choices BUT he completely won me over with the way he treated Sidney! 
 'She couldn't know too much. She could never know. Never. I gave her enough so I could still have her, but I took everything.' 
 'Four Letter Word' was a wonderfully paced and steamy story, perfect for when you crave a sweet and sexy contemporary romance. J. Daniels is one of my go-to romance authors, and she really delivered with Brian and Sidney's story. I cannot wait for more stories in this series! 
 'Love was a risk. It was wild and unpredictable. You could either hold on for the ride, not knowing how it would end, or you could let go and never know the amazing you could've had.'

4,13872,3,"""I had to look up ""geek"" because it surely didn't mean the detailed interest of , say, a computer geek. So I learned the carnival meaning. Luckily the really gross and bloody part occurred only briefly at the beginning. The next oddity was the father deciding to produce his own freak show for the carnival (based on his seeing horticultural variety at the International Test Rose Garden). The mother dutifully took drugs to alter her offspring. Their living children were four: Arty with fins for arms and legs; Elly and Iphy, the Siamese twins; Oly, the hunchbacked, dwarf narrator; and Chick the youngest, with his special powers. 
 Had it not been a group read, I might have stopped there. However, I remembered a comment of a professor about other novels with ""grotesques"": What could the author say through them that couldn't be said through more average characters? I decided to read a bit more through that frame. Then the next chapter captured my attention with its narrative strategy of jumping into the future with Oly and her daughter Miranda. Several events are revealed that make a reader wonder how they happened. That same strategy is used a few more times, like a carrot to keep one reading. For the first two thirds of the book, the pacing was very effective. Then the notes of a reporter/participant were introduced, and while they provided important information that Oly, the narrator, couldn't have known, they dragged the pace considerably. Also the very ending of the book, while motivated, seemed to take too long. It also left me wondering to what extent it was a change in her character instead of an extension. 
 I have not yet answered the What could be said question. First hypothesis, something about disability issues. Did not hold up. Second hypothesis, something about minorities. The carnival provided a sort of ghetto where deformities were normal; however, the carnival was dependent on the money of the norms buying tickets. Oly didn't feel odd till she no longer lived in the carnival setting. 
 One group member read an interview with the author and learned she is an environmentalist and is anti-war. Perhaps the father's manipulation is an extreme of the various pollutants in our atmosphere, food, and water. And there was one paragraph in the reporter's notes where Arty ponders how people could criticize his followers who are maimed by choice and not criticize war with the injuries it produces. Maybe. And is it really choice when there is cult-like power in the leader and manipulation? I feel the need to think more on the followers' willingness to endure amputation and what it might say about other things we readers may be willing to give up and for what.""",2015-11-19 22:18:02,Geek Love,"fiction,fantasy,paranormal"

Most people also didn't like the fact that the murderer gets revealed fairly early on, but the book didn't focus on who was commiting the crimes, but why they were commiting them, and I actually really enjoyed that aspect.""",2017-01-05 15:17:08,There's Someone Inside Your House,"young-adult,mystery,thriller,crime,romance,fiction"
7,25854070,5,"""Oh. Man. This one got me right in the feels. 
 Trevor is a successful artist in the end stage of renal disease. He's been on dialysis for the past seven years in the hopes of finding a suitable donor, but his kidney function is failing and he probably has less than a year to live, even with dialysis. He's 39 and facing his mortality. It's creeping up on what will likely be his last Christmas with his large and loving family, but his flight is cancelled when a blizzard grinds all transportation around Denver to a halt. 
 Marc is a driven attorney, hell-bent on making partner at 38. He's sacrificed his entire adult life to be the kind of son his homophobic mother would be proud of, only to note that he has no life except work. Stranded in the white out, he makes his way to a nearby hotel and books a room for the night. Seeing Trevor in the cafe, Marc is immediately attracted. His invitation to sit and join him becomes a long conversation and a further invite to share his room once Trevor confesses that he was unable to get a room due to a sell-out. 
 Neither man is really open to more than one night's solace, despite their incendiary passion. Trevor hasn't had a partner for years, and he's had even less of a libido for most of that time. Something about Marc stirs him, however. In the cold light of day neither Marc nor Trevor can admit they have more than lust boiling along, even if it's true. That said, Trevor doesn't want to reveal his illness and Marc knows a relationship will detract from his workaholic ways. Still, Marc can't abide with Trevor spending his Christmas Eve, and maybe longer, on a couch in the hotel's lobby. He invites Trevor to his beautiful and barren home outside Boulder. 
 Trevor's reluctant to let any connection build between himself and Marc, but it happen anyway. They spend a fantastic Christmas together, Trevor coming clean about his illness and prognosis when Marc presses him for more than their three day fling when he returns from visiting his family. It is bittersweet and melancholy and heart-wrenching and wonderful that these two lonely souls find a spark in such dire times. 
 I fully enjoyed the resolution to this one, which, I will state firmly, was an HEA. Marc's selfless offering of himself helped him to realize all that he had to offer others, and allowed him to break free of his self-loathing. I really liked how he engaged himself with his colleagues and found the best way to handle his very sad situation. Trevor is a man who has resolved himself on imminent death. He's afraid to hope one more, probably last, time. And it shows. He does find the courage to accept Marc's lifeline, however, and it proves the adage that life is always darkest before the dawn. 
 I just plain loved this. It's a well-told strangers-to-lovers story that doesn't ooze sap, despite the medical realities of the plot. The Christmas aspect was balanced, with high and low points--love, loss, isolation, acceptance. I will admit to shedding a tear, or three. As a person with an even rarer blood type than Trevor, I sympathized with his plight. (I may B- but I will always be positive!) There aren't too many sexytimes, but they are all about the feels. Highly recommend!

9,186074,5,"""This is one of those books that once you start reading it you just cannot stop. It was relentlessly readable. The broad outline of the plot is somewhat conventional but the way the story is told is brilliant and very captivating. 
 The protagonist of the story is a man named Kvothe. At the start of the novel Kvothe is a humble innkeeper living under an assumed name. He supposedly has a past history of great heroism/mythic adventure that has come to ruin in some way. This book is the first third of his life story that he is narrating to a Chronicler. 
 Kvothe is not a totally likable or reliable narrator and it is this continual undercurrent of distrust at the recollections of our supposed hero and the clever framing device that add a great layer to the main plot, recounting Kvothe's childhood and attendance at university. Additionally, this book is beautifully written, well paced, and endlessly intriguing. I love how this book treats magic, and the world building thus far has been great for where we are in the story. Every aspect of this world feels so real and so fascinating.

 Part 1 in a new series 
 My Four Letter Word Review . . . 
 Let's start off with the confession that this is my first J. Daniels book that I have read. 
 I know, I know this is blasphemous but now that I have read my first J. Daniels books it definitely won't be my last. 
 In Four Letter Word we have Sydney who is a bit down in her luck where it comes to love but life won't get her down. With her re-locating to lick her wounds at her best friends house she ends up berating a wrong number on the behalf of all sisterhood. What might have been a moment of oopsie daisy ended up being a game changer for her. 
 ""WILD"" was his four letter word for ""love."" 
 Brian is just surviving. He's not really living until one fateful phone call that changes his world. Brian's stuck in the pits of hell of guilt. This guilt is causing him to make all kinds of bad choices, but something about the anonymous ranting phone call wakes him up back to the living. 
 On a whim he starts a texting relationship with Sydney. At first it was because she breathed life back into him, but very quickly she got under his skin. This should be a good thing, but Brian's recent decision making has made things difficult to have a real life relationship. 
 Sydney may have just got out of her marriage but her new phone pal sparks what has been missing for her all along. What starts out as a phone relationship turns into something quite steamy and sweet. 
 I liked the growth of Sydney and Brian together and as individuals. I loved the friendships of all the other characters especially Tori and Jamie and now I can't wait for their story, since we know its going to be a bumpy ride between these two. 
 I quite liked this book and all that was Sydney and Brian. Their was a good amount of angst without being too much with a nice balance of humor, steam and second chances 
 Can't Wait for Jamie's story and his snark.

 Part 4 of an ongoing series 
 My Kept From You Review . . . 
 Finally we get Killian 'Kite' Kane's story. And what a story it was. Killian for me has always been the mysterious dark horse in this series. Now we find out that there was quite the reason for Killian's dark side. However, we also find out what helps tame his inner beast. 
 Savannah AKA Savvy has her own past but she always finds the good bits in everyone. This is part of the gift and curse that is Savvy for Killian. He wants her to find the good in him, but he's also tortured enough to think he doesn't have any left and he doesn't deserve any good in his life. 
 ""Because if you come near me again, next time I won't let you go."" 
 Even though Killian was young when he met his savior, he always knew the potential of her. Which is part of the reason he let her go. Now years later and Savvy has walked back into his life. This time around he won't make the same mistake twice. 
 I absolutely loved Killian and Savvy together. Savvy was a strong kick ass heroine, while Killian was the most loyal protective man you could ask for. However, they both had their pasts to contend with. 
 Throughout the years, Killian still knew what Savvy was to him and held that dear and near to his dark heart. I loved this part of Killian that he kept for her. Nashoda Rose has such a gift at creating beauty in a darker world. Kept from You wasn't nearly as dark as some of the others. Actually it had more light and hope than the others which helped balance the series out. However, it's Killian's past and fears that create the darkness within him. The guys of Tear Asunder are all near and dear to my heart and I'm so thankful we finally got Killian's story. Thankfully we have a new character in town with Trevor, whom was Savvy's neighbor and we will soon get his story as well. Can't wait!""",2015-06-04 15:37:25,"Kept from You (Tear Asunder, #4)",romance

 eARC for Honest Review from Author 
 Finally the conclusion to Brad and Julia. If you have not read the first two please be cautious of this review as their will be spoilers for the first two books. 
 Brad's fail safe solution of protecting Julia is with an engagement. At the end of book 2, I was thinking this engagement was out of love but I had a nagging feeling that it was only for her safety and I was concerned that Brad was going to go back to his man whore ways but Brad surprised me in this book. 
 Right from the beginning we get to realize that Brad is really all in with this relationship. He truly loves Julia. Throughout this book we get to feel and experience the depth of Brad's emotions and love towards Julia. 
 Julia loves Brad but she also wants some independence so she conforms to some notions but puts her foot down in others. She is fierce when it comes to Brad even when it comes to his family, her family, or her friends. 
 As the wedding gets closer temptations and pasts rear their ugly head. Julia's ex-fiance tries to make a dent into her plans but with his appearance it only solidifies her feelings for Brad. As Brad is trying to turn a new leaf he gifts Julia the strip club causing them to crash head on to Brad's past and potential weakness. 
 As my heart started to get palpitations wondering what Brad was going to do with temptation and I wanted to bitch slap Alexis with her antics causing me so much grief then Brad surprises Alexis and me. 
 Things are going as smooth as can be then be in the world of Brad and Julia they still find time to explore sexually, while they prepare for their wedding, evade bitchy friends and trying families. 
 Just when we think we are going to get our HEA the rug gets pulled under our feet. As Brad's world falls apart Julia fighting spirit comes to the forefront. However, not to spoil to much but we do get our HEA in the end. 
 I really did enjoy this series. It had so many different facets going on while a beautiful love story was blossoming. I loved the growth and depth of Brad. One of my weaknesses are man whores who succumb to love. It may not be the norm relationship, but it works for Brad and Julia and in the end that is all that matters. When the pivotal angst was happening in the book I did find that part a bit rushed which caused me to lose a bit of the dimension in that storyline but it didn't effect the whole series experience. 
 I am a big fan of Alessandra Torre and if you like Erotica with an edge and a little kink and drama then this is series worth the read.

 Finally, I have been in a reading funk lately with being bombarded with similar plots, formulas and story lines but this little number shook me out of it. It was different with an air of mystery and suspense in the background but still had a great love story. 
 Here we have Dahlia who has lived through a lot of sadness and loss but one constant she always had was Ben who also happened to be the love of her life. With Ben they have a huge once in a lifetime love being friends since they were kids growing into lovers and on their way to getting married....then the unthinkable happens and she has to live through another HUGE loss. 
 When Dahlia was still with Ben, she had a girls night out and during this night out with her best friend she meets a singer named River from a band who she is instantly drawn too but she does the right thing and goes back to her boyfriend and pushes thoughts of this singer to the back of her mind. 
 ""...All I know is, I was a young college girl who flirted with an insanely attractive guy at a bar and had to leave because she felt like the cosmic universe had crashed down on her. And she couldn't accept that; she had a boyfriend."" 
 Dahlia is having a hard time with the loss of Ben but with time and the support of her friends she is able to finally move on and start living again. Her first real step out into the world she runs right back into River from years gone past and their connection is as strong as ever. 
 River and Dahlia make up for lost time and their connection does nothing but grow and cements the two of them together. Dahlia has a hard time with this since these feelings are so new, different and stronger than she had with Ben but since Ben is gone she has to let go and move forward with River. 
 Now this love story is all and good and I adore it but the awesome part through the whole book is the undercurrents of secrets that you know are going to cause a world of shit for these two. There are so many elements that are going to be pulled together I assume in the next few books that can either strengthen or break River and Dahlia. But let me tell you that epilogue HOLY SHIT!!! SO was not what I expected but I LOVED that twist and I can NOT WAIT to read TORN to find out what happens with this new twist and how they play out with all the other undercurrents. 
 This books is a must read for me and I can't wait to read more from the series.

 I loved this book. I loved every character. ALL OF THEM. (well maybe expect the bad guy) All of their interactions were fantastic. I was laughing, I was heating up (if you know what I mean), I was angst ridden, I was giddy, I was so many things from this book and I can NOT wait to see what happens with Allie and her dilemma. Could be potentially delicious. 
 You heart stops with Lucas's first smirk and you love Emma the moment she face plants the ground. 
 Their coupling was against the norm and that is why I loved them. One of things that I loved was that they were a strong couple throughout the book without all the extra petty miscommunication drama and relationship angst. The drama came from outside sources and while this was happening it was only making their relationship stronger. 
 This book has tattooed, pierced bad boys who steal your heart and fun loving friends and family to make you whole. 
 Lucas will definitely be making an appearance on book boyfriend monday. *swoon*

I am so glad I kept reading, however. By the end, I was fully immersed in Ed's story. The book is clever and touching, and this novel offers more proof that Zusak is a truly superior author- he can work magic on ordinary situations, he has a beautiful gift with language and he really makes a reader think.

22,17950614,4,"""First I wanna say that this is one of my favorite series of all time and this book was brilliant. But, that doesn't change the fact that I had major issues with the last 40 pages (Part 6) and the ending overall. Because of those issues, I'm giving it 4 stars. 
 In this book, it is clear things are getting worse and worse. The Storks are wreaking havoc all over the country, new propositions and bills are being put forth by the government to make unwinding an even more ordinary aspect of life. And in the midst are our main characters: Connor, Risa and Lev... (and all the other characters introduced throughout the series: Starkey, Hayden, Cam, Nelson, Argent, Grace, Sonia...etc). They are all working to their end goals, some sinister and some innocent. I loved the intensity of each chapter and how perfectly they were constructed and written. The characters were great, as usual, and definitely brought me back into the world. I loved the tough choices each character had to make and the consequences of those choices. There were moments where I cried and moments where I cheered. Everything seemed so perfect.... until Part 6. 
 Leading into Part 6, we experienced some heartbreaking stuff. Everything that happened seemed like the only possible outcome... It seemed to set up the chance for other, secondary characters to take the reins... but no. That's not how Neal Shusterman decided to do it. The next bit will be in spoilers.... 
 Lev wasn't killed by the cops beneath lady liberty. Connor was unwound but put back together like the unwind legend of Humphrey Dunfee. Sure, Connor learned to be more accepting of Cam thanks to his own process of rewinding. Sure, Lev got to see Miracolina again. But here's the thing... Lev was always meant to die. He repeatedly searched for ways to feel fulfilled and only discovered that feeling when he was gunned down. I don't understand how he could feel okay about surviving. I guess having Miracolina around made things okay...? Or was it his kinkajou that made things better? :P As for Connor... I felt like his survival was okay, simply because he learned more about Cam through the ordeal. We know things would have gone okay for the country without Connor... We know that the Parental Override bill was vetoed. I guess we just had to have Connor reunited with his parents... Whatever. I can handle his survival, but I'm not okay with Lev's. 
 As for the rest, I think letting both Lev and Connor live took Grace's accomplishment out of the spotlight, and I think she deserved the recognition for her work with the printer. 
 Una's wedding was so sad and yet beautiful. And the fact that her and Cam have developed some sort of connection... just... YES! :D 
 In the end, at least Starkey died and Nelson got his just desserts.  
 It seems I am the only one complaining about the ending of the book, and the series overall. But I truly loved the book, but I wish it had ended a bit more ... I don't know... gritty? In the end I could have given it less stars for my complaints, but I really enjoyed the rest of the book, which is why I gave it 4 stars.""",2014-09-02 01:29:48,"UnDivided (Unwind, #4)","young-adult,fiction,fantasy,paranormal,mystery,thriller,crime,romance"

 This is a very promising debut novel that is based highly off the authors own awe-inspiring, cross-country adventure at a young age. 
 I was so amazingly wrapped up in this story that I just HAD to stay up last and finish it. The chemistry between the characters is undeniable and genuine; it's easy to lose yourself with the time they share together, almost as if you were there. Angeli is a tremendously brave -despite her unknowing of it-- to take on the long road ahead of her alone. With each cherished friend she meets up with, she is trialed with many different choices to make, and finds pieces of herself along the way. 
 Each character you meet in this story has their own problems they face and have to deal with. I feel that not only with just Angeli, readers could relate to, but there is a character in here that everyone might feel a tad of a connection with. Angeli has witnessed so much. That connection is hard to come by in books, and I feel it is a very important bond between reader and character/author. 
 Angeli faces a lot of her own struggles before the journey and as it takes place. 
 The stress she undergoes, as well, and how she comes out stronger in the end is inspiring for anyone who just needs that little push to get up and follow their own dreams-- to live a little. 
 I love how each chapter ends with a mileage log and a page from her diary for each day, filled with important revelations and the emotions she experienced. Experiences such as being detained on the Canadian border, Ground Zero in NYC, the struggles with two boys who claim their love for her, endless! All in all, she sees that there are others out there who suffer much worse things than her in their lives, the different ways people live and their cultures. She escapes danger, and goodness, just exciting to live vicariously through these pages. I wish I could have gone through with making a trip like this. My best friend growing up and I would mention it in passing but plans just never fell through. What a great learning experience this must have been for the author. This story absolutely proves that life is what you make it. 
 In the epilogue of this story, she states that she will never know exactly who she is, or what may become of her career-- if she ever decides one at all... Well, let me just offer this, she has nothing to worry about. Her unique and refreshing storytelling is going to get her far, very far and I am excited that we were able to witness the debut of a long and beautiful career ahead of her. And I am sure that after the readers finally get their hands on this coming of age novel, that they too will agree. =) !""",2013-08-12 20:38:52,"Once Upon a Road Trip (Once Upon a Road Trip, #1)","young-adult,romance,non-fiction,fiction,history,historical fiction,biography"

 I have never read anything by Ernest Hemingway before. I knew of his reputation, but never found the desire to pick anything up. After this book, I am really fascinated with their lives--especially hers--and I definitely have the desire to read his works. 
 One thing I loved about the books is that the author didn't feel the need to make one of them right and one of them wrong when their marriage begins to unravel. By the end you are aware of their strengths and faults and love them for it. You can see the intense personality and background to Ernest that will eventually be his undoing.

32,8683812,4,"""Maybe you have to be a Hemingway fan (or a Hemingway fan and a woman) to go for this one. I fully confess that The Sun Also Rises is one of my favorite books EVER, and I've been on something of a Hemingway kick of late. (Blame Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris, or my 2008 trip to Pamplona and San Sebastian, or the collected short story collection I gobbled up in grad school.) 
 I think if you have even a touch of Hemingway fever, you feel like squealing when Hem meets up with Gertrude and Alice, Dos, Pound and Shakespear, and of course the lovably-drunk F. Scott and Zelda. The story is told from the perspective of Hemingway's first wife, Hadley -- surely a grounding force for the time they were together, up until the point that Hemingway decided he wanted to move on. I'm no expert (I count Wiki as a source of Hemingway knowledge), but the book feels historically accurate and meticulously researched, so I have no qualms there. 
 What I do miss, though, is the Hemingway voice. While Hadley was sitting in her sawmill apartment taking care of Bumby's cough, I was a little restless. I wanted to be where Hem was, in the cafes where he banged out story after story, in the thick of the salon with Gertrude instead of to the side with Alice. 
 Still, I think it would be very difficult not to love a story that begins (or very nearly) with these words: ""This isn't a detective story -- not hardly. I don't want to say, Keep watch for the girl who will come along and ruin everything, but she's coming anyway, set on her course in a gorgeous chipmunk coat and fine shoes, her sleek brown hair bobbed so close to her well-made head she'll seem like a pretty otter in my kitchen.

36,1122023,3,"""Reads kind of like your standard slasher movie. 
 The opening quote on the front cover of this book simply says, 'Scream meets The Exorcist', and that is a very apt description of the novel as a whole. It mixes in the elements you will see from your typical slasher movie, but also adds a paranormal, demonic possession storyline ala Exorcist. If I was being nitpicky, I'd say it was less Scream like though, as Scream was a movie that tossed the slasher conventions on their head, and created clever twists using those tropes. This book does play it more standard, and is therefore more generic than clever in the end. Despite this however, I did enjoy this. 
 The plot line for 'The Harrowing' follows five teenagers, all from different social groups, who have decided to stay within the confines of their university during a holiday period instead of going home. While alone on campus, they make the clever horror movie decision to play with a ouija board, and chaos ensues.... 
 What I most appreciated about this book was that it actually put some though into the demonic possession angle. While the entity is of course evil, it's not simply just the devil, or a dead person with 'unfinished business'. The twists and turns kept me intrigued to the finale, and while ultimately the whole thing is a little predictable, I can at least say I was entertained throughout. 
 The characters here are pretty generic, each one belonging to your typical horror movie archetypes. We have the geek, the jock, the slut, the goth, and the supposed 'cool dude'. While the characters themselves don't stand out too much, and there's not too much to get attached to in anyway. I can say overall that I at least liked them all, there weren't any annoying characters in the group to bring the novel down and that probably ended up relating to my enjoyment of the story. 
 Overall though, this is a perfectly fun read. You won't really remember too much after you have read it, and it's certainly not going to go down as one of the best of the genre, but it keeps you entertained, and is a quick easy read, so that gets an easy 3 stars from me.""",2013-12-21 15:32:03,The Harrowing,"fiction,fantasy,paranormal,mystery,thriller,crime,young-adult"

 As someone who didn't much like 'Across the Universe', I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. 
 This novel is set in the future, after a war that devastated the world, This world has androids and reveries - where you can relive the memories you want to. Ella has a special gift of being abut the control these reveries (which were invented by her mother) and things start to get weird after she sees her dead father in them, giving her warnings. 
 I enjoyed the plot of this novel. It was fast, full of action and intrigue, and information was released slowly throughout the novel, so you didn't work everything out at once. 
 Ella was an interesting character - she's really relatable, you can really feel her grief for her father, and her confusion over all the events. I love that she doesn't lose her head automatically over the love interest character. She tells him when he's out of line, and her feelings for him grow gradually. It's not instalove. 
 Jack was a really charming character, and I would love to know more about him. I thought her mother and her dad and Ms White were well developed, but there were some others that needed a bit more depth - like Julie and Xavier, who were kind of just there.

In a novel which purports to be ""historical"" fiction, one does tend to expect some explanation of the setting and historical context. Fortunately, I am not unfamiliar with the Cathars or medieval France, but if I had been, I wouldn't be much enlightened after reading this nearly 700 page book. Instead, the reader is plunged into the Inquisitional terror with little or no idea of the actual conflict or why there is conflict at all. Apparently it should just be enough to invoke the Inquisition and we're immediately there - Catholics bad, everyone else, good. Interestingly, the author uses her sex scenes as tools for characterization and to manipulate the reader. They were obviously placed and obviously constructed to create an assumption about the women participating. There was very little subtlety involved. I do prefer subtlety. The second half of the book, the medieval story sort of broke down and the author appeared to have more interest in the modern story.

 On the one hand, it was an interesting and intriguing look at Hemingway before he was 'Hemingway,' the man before the legend. McLain does a great job with her characters, with her story, with her writing. I enjoyed peering into the Lost Generation in early Paris; so many familiar names before or as they made it big. And it certainly looked at how relationships can change with circumstances, in this case fame, but also the people you live with. Most married people bemoan the loss of their single friends after the wedding and again after children (or vice versa), and this is the novel of why that's not really bad. The writing is vibrating, the story intriguing, and I finished the whole book in less than 24 hours. It's an easy read. 
 And yet. I couldn't drop the feeling that I wouldn't really have cared about the novel if it hadn't been centered on the Hemingways. The story is character driven, but only because they were such characters. Much of the tale was about how Hemingway struggled to make it. And Hadley - Hadley was sweet and charming and, you know, perfect. She never did anything wrong, except maybe love and need her husband too much. Sorry, I don't buy that. Just like a marriage takes two, so does its degradation - and yes, Ernest gets the cheater blame and no one makes their spouse be unfaithful...But before that, all failures were painted as his, and I don't buy that. 
 Then, too, there were dichotomies. He loved her for her strength but without him she was weak. Even with him, she was passive if it was what he wanted. It's hard to see it both ways. Maybe that's how it ran, I haven't read anything else about their lives, but even in France with a hip crowd, it takes a strong woman to leave her husband and become a single mom, especially with no job skills, especially in 1927, especially when she was brought up classically and seemed so against the post-war movement. 
 So unlike many of the people who reviewed the novel, I can't help but think the real Hadley must have been stronger than she was portrayed. I'm interested in learning more about her, honestly, and I'm glad she ultimately found her happily ever after.

White did an admirable job of trying to throw in some misdirects, but they were all fairly convenient and obvious. The history White gives the main character is a somewhat interesting backstory, but I wish it had connected better to the rest of the novel. 
 The writing was really, really plain. Not one interesting turn of phrase, and if another author uses ""sign off"" so consistently to describe having ended a phone call, I will eat several hats.

57,32336119,5,"""Worth the Wait was an excellent title for this book because it was definitely worth it! Not only do we get Hogan and Violet's story, we also are treated to Nathan and Brooklin. There is even a little side romance where Colt finds some happiness as well. At first, I was hoping for Nathan to get his own story. I wasn't sure I would like both romances in one book. But both couples' stories were woven together so well that it really worked for me in the end. 
 Hogan has a lot of baggage from his late wife and for a time was not the nicest guy to women except get them in bed. Violet is fiercely independent and has worked hard for everything she has, including the diner. Between Hogan and Violet, the attraction is there, but they have a ways to go before they can trust each other. I was really rooting for them. I loved Hogan in the first book. He just seemed so lost and deserving of a good woman in his life. 
 Nathan is smitten from the beginning. He has a tough job cracking the walls around Brooklin. But she is harboring a secret, so her reasons for keeping to herself are valid. I'll let you read it to find out her secret. There does end up being a little mystery and the scene toward the end was pretty intense. 
 I highly recommend this book as well as the first one, Don't Tempt Me. Both have great characters, lots of fun banter and scorching romances that will just make you sigh.""",2017-03-27 14:46:44,Worth the Wait (Guthrie Brothers #2),"romance,mystery,thriller,crime,fiction"
58,18634982,4,"""Eyes on You is definitely one of those books that sucks you right in. Robin is finally getting her career back. A successful book and a new TV show have her thinking that life is pretty good. But someone has other ideas. Slowly, she starts to feel like someone is following her and watching her. She starts to get threatening messages and someone drugs her more than once. The problem is that Robin thinks she knows who is doing it, but no one believes her. 
 I thought the psychological suspense was was spot on and could feel the frustration building in Robin as things begin to unravel. For the most part, I liked Robin's character. She is ambitious and likable, if a little too trusting. I just thought she made some incredibly stupid choices throughout the story. She did redeem herself in the end and I was satisfied with her growth. 
 There were a multitude of suspects in the book. I was happy that I wasn't able to figure it out early on. I like it more when I'm kept guessing and was surprised at the identity in the end. I definitely recommend this one. It's the first I have read by this author and I look forward to reading more by her.""",2014-06-24 05:18:25,Eyes on You,"mystery,thriller,crime,fiction,romance"

Ms. Duvall has done it again. The third installment in the Immortal Guardian series was just so good. I am so loving this series and the characters. Not only are the books well written, they are filled with action, romance, humor and very hot and sexy immortals! What's not to love? 
 Bastien Newcombe has come along way from the first book. While most of the other Immortals still dislike him, they are slowly starting to trust him. Dr. Melanie Lipton wants to get to know him a lot better. I loved these two together. Melanie is a great match for Bastien. I loved her forwardness and determination. It really seemed to throw Bastien for a loop. In addition to their love story, the rest of the Immortal family plays a big part in this book. It was nice to see and have the others involved. I won't say how, but Ami plays a huge part. She is one of my favorites in the series, so I was thrilled she was in the book. 
 While the ending was a sweet HEA for Bastien and Melanie, the book left me wanting more! It's not a cliff hanger in the traditional sense, but having to wait to see how Ami's situation will play out is going to drive me crazy! I did find out that Richart is getting his own novella, In Still Darkness, in May, 2013 in the anthology, Predatory. I'll be stalking Amazon for that because it will have to tide me over until Etienne's book comes out in September, 2013.

A massive plague has hit the world (or at least southern California) taking not only Robert Neville's wife and child, but the rest of the world. He holes himself up in his house, protecting it from the vampires with garlic, crosses, and planks over the windows. He only goes out in the day, and even then only when there is no cloud cover, so that he can be home in time for dark, when the vampires attack his house. He eventually gets extreme cabin fever, driving him to drink and going mad. He tries to cope by looking into the cause of the disease when he really just wants some kind of companionship. He at one point obsesses over trying to catch a surviving, though feral, dog. I really felt sorry for Robert Neville. I don't want to give away any more of the plot, though that is really secondary to this character driven story. 
 It's rather short, only 5 1/2 hours in the audio version, which is probably a good thing. The voice actor is exceptional, with a small variety of character voices and really acts out the scenes. I highly recommend the audio version, but I am also going to have to read the novel myself as well.

 Or maybe it is about loss. 
 There is a mother who lost her son twenty years before and descended into alcoholism, deep depression and a loss of society. 
 There is a grand/father who lost his grandson and most of those he's cared about in his life -- simply through the movement of time -- who's never had the love of the daughters he loves, who needs closure and a chance to heal himself and those he's leaving behind. 
 There is a man who lost his father to an act of violence -- terrible on one hand, misunderstood on the other -- who lives a lonely existence on the alvar, being without really being. 
 There is a girl who loses the only one she ever loved, and she never even had a chance to tell him; there is a mother who lost all her sons; there is a man who lost his self-respect and his health; there is a family who lost their cohesion; there are two boys and an old man and a drunk man and an exiled man and a police man and two soldiers who lost their lives. There is deep loss in Echoes from the Dead on the Swedish isle of Oland; it is an island of victims. 
 And there is another person to consider. He killed some of those who lost their lives, or was the subject of others' losses. His actions rippled out to catalyze new actions, which created more victims. But he was as much a victim as everyone else. A man-child who never matured, a boy who wanted to be respected and be good and was at times, a boy-man who couldn't control his violence but was able to rationalize it, a lost heart who just wanted to be home with his mother. He was a victim too. And Johan Theorin lets him be exactly what he is, letting us care for him if we want, without passing any authorial judgement, simply letting him exist amongst all those his life effected and affected.

 I'm not going to write a big review for this cause you know what there's already a lot of fantastic reviews out there, what I am going to do is write some of my thoughts... 
 First of all This series has been one of my top favourite reads of all time, and this book really was the Icing on the cake. This love story has brought us full circle in that this is in 'my book' how Brad has come to realise that he is very much IN-LOVE with Julia, this is how he entwines himself in all that is Julia, how she becomes his best friend, his soul mate how they're engaged and how this year that they're planning their wedding is how they both become a whole unit TOGETHER. 
 Sexually they have a somewhat taboo relationship, and in that way this is not a 'normal' love story, I love Alessandra yet again for giving us readers something extra to enjoy, This book was erotic, beautiful and fluent I very much enjoyed the ride. As a couple they love to share themselves with an extra person, and this was an extra dimension their relationship. Saying all that , Brad is starting to feel that he didn't want anyone other than Julia but Julia just wanted to give something extra to Brad, really this has a complete feel in the final instalment, I just felt that as a couple they became Whole together. 
 I loved how Julia is feisty as ever and held herself well when confronted by Brads 'bad' mafia father, The whole protecting Julia scenario and Julia fighting strong was just another reason why I loved her and how Brad was her match in heaven they suit each other perfectly . Not only that but I enjoyed how Julia and Brad's life has changed their responsibilities are different, how Julia's friends might hold grudges but Julia became mature in her actions to the whole ordeal.

 I loved it. There were certainly very ""childish"" elements, I guess you would say, and nothing was too deep. It was, however, very thought-provoking, as the struggles the characters went through were all too real and very well explored. 
 The thing with the ""childish elements"" is that it reminded me, in a way, of a Tiger Lily book I read.. The book took place in ""The Middle of Nowhere,"" which was actually the town's name. I kid you not. With this book, it was a bit less overstated, with peoples' names like Professor Cake and Mr. Pound (POUND CAKE! It just adds to the humor a little tiny bit, without being IN YOUR FACE) 
 Also, here's something I was thinking when I was listening to this book, regarding a certain very enthusiastic woman: Ha! Michael Page makes Mrs. Molasses so hilarious and I picture her like Mrs. Grunion from Mr. Peabody and Sherman - ""Yoo-hoo! This is Mr. Trousers! I found him dying in my courtyard!""

 Left Drowning is one of the most incredible books I have read in a while. Ms. Park created a world with 6 amazing characters that I fell in love with and immediately adopted into my own family. On top of all that I learned she is an evil genius who likes to torture her readers wickedly, more on that later. 
 The world of Left Drowning centers on Blythe McGuire and Chris Shepherd. Through meeting Chris a lonely Blythe is wrapped into a group of friends she would never have thought she could have. Chris, Sabin (Who I am hoping gets a story of his own some day!), Estelle and Eric all bring Blythe into their intimate circle of friendship and love helping to transform not only her but them as well. 
 This world was so real and so emotionally raw for me. The magic Ms. Park wields in her ability to create a world so vivid and bold, evoking emotions in myself that are normally detached from me when reading, is astounding. Her words are so powerful I couldn't help but feel everything that Blythe felt, and in essence I became Blythe as I read and it made the experience 10x more profound than I expected. 
 The anticipation and excitement I felt as Blythe and Chris interacted was so enticing. I was feeling the butterflies and the raw sexual energy that Blythe felt. I ached for Chris to have her and was driven damn near crazy myself as I waited and hoped for that moment to come. The way the steam scenes were written with anticipation and longing heightened the reading experience and set me on fire. 
 Let me start this next part by stating I don't cry easy. I didn't cry when I got married or had my two girls which is something that I know makes a lot of people cry, heck my husband even cried when we got married. What makes me cry? Well lets see physical pain makes me cry like stubbing my toe really bad, or if someone where to hit me. I also cry when I see an animal hurt, I mean that is just horrible stuff so how couldn't I cry when an animal is in pain. 
 So anyways, there have been many books that are emotional or angsty and have made my eyes glisten with unshed tears. That is the important thing is I never dropped a tear. Well guess what, apparently Ms. Park made me stub my toe after ramming my funny bone into something hard and then forced me watch as she kicked my imaginary puppy. Why the hell did you have to be so mean to me?!?!! What did I do to you?! My word I would never have thought someone so sweet looking could be so violent and wicked! I mean she must have done all those things to me since 69% of the way through (not 70% and I don't care how naughty yelling ""69 killed me"" sounds!) a gorgeously written book I was actually crying, I mean tears coming down my cheeks and a runny nose! My heart, my poor freaking heart was in agony, I felt my chest constrict even. I was literally feeling crushed by what I had just read. I was not able to shit rainbows! 
 If that isn't talent, I don't know what is. To actually make me feel exactly as the character was feeling. I was living in the world created by Ms. Park in this book. I was Blythe. Well, of course after being made to feel like complete shit I had to keep reading until late into the night because damn it I wanted to feel better. Thankfully I carried on and soon found my heart healing, and I was able to move on which made the lack of sleep I am feeling this morning worth it. 
 This is a good long novel at 399 pages, a standalone that wont leave you hanging on a cliffhanger. All I can hope for is there will be perhaps a companion novel someday for some of the other amazing friends I made while reading this book. 
 So yes, I felt this book deserved more than the standard 5/5, it was at least a 6/5 for me. Lord only knows how many more of my imaginary puppies Ms. Park would kick if I gave her any less ;)""",2013-07-21 19:35:55,"Left Drowning (Left Drowning, #1)","romance,young-adult,fiction"

91,147843,4,"""Ms. Britain has written a thoroughly enjoyable fantasy epic. I know this book is well over a decade old, but the shift in writing has moved away from this style of story-telling, that slow burn that gradually percolates a story through a very long journey that leads to a final climactic ending. I liked this story a lot. It was a great place to spend a few hours in the forests of Sacordia. The characters were well thought out, the setting was perfect, and the action was intense. It was a well-paced, good fantasy romp. 
 The one issue that I had is that the dialogue was not particularly great. Conversations between characters were adequate, and conveyed the meaning of the story and the plot along its natural course. But I couldn't point to one single part of this story as being brilliant. Ms. Britain has some wonderful ideas and some intriguing concepts that are in place throughout her novel, yet there is nothing that truly sold me on her characters. None of her characters were truly stand-out or overly memorable. The setting was more engaging than the characters for the most part. I somewhat liked the king, but there wasn't a whole lot to recommend any of the characters. Karigan's father was a decent example, but he's not in the story for very long. 
 Karigan herself is a good character, but again she doesn't seem to be very developed. She's a strong personality in the story which is chock full of strong personalities, but her character herself doesn't seem well developed. Her history before the fateful encounter with F'ryan Coblebay doesn't seem well developed and she doesn't seem to change much or develop over the course of the novel in a way that makes it seem like she is a different person after this experience than she was when she began the adventure. This isn't really a negative point so much as an undercooked one in my opinion. I think this will be rectified in later additions to the series. 
 Overall, I liked the story quite a bit and look forward to reading the other novels in the series.""",2016-01-25 11:45:16,"Green Rider (Green Rider, #1)","fantasy,paranormal,young-adult,fiction,romance,history,historical fiction,biography"

 It was good for what it was, a prequel showcasing the Spartan's training and their 'first contact' with the Covenant and the Master Chief's first experience with Cortana.

 Oh Dante Walker, you cocky bastard, how I've fallen for your wit and charm. I'll admit, this book is not going to be for everyone based solely on our wonderful narrator, Dante. He's an ass. He's deeply in love with himself and can be quite rude or put on the full charm when needed. But I love him for all those quirks. The amount of times I LOL'd, well I don't even know. Seriously just go look up some quotes from this book. DO IT! Scott's writing and dialogue are spot on. You know what kind of person Dante is from the start. And when he meets Charlie, who is just pure nice down to her core, and she starts to point out the good traits within Dante. A little bit of his softer side starts to make an appearance. 
 Scott has created a different take on the whole Angels/Fallen Angels craze. You've still got people like Dante working for The Boss Man(hell) and people working for The Big Man(Heaven) but in a whole different way. So if you like your fallen Angel books and you want something with a different sort of narration(meaning you want to laugh and roll your eyes(in a good way)) than pick this one up.

I got so sick of feeling sorry for Fitz that I eventually shut off my emotions to save myself the heartache.

 So before I begin my review, I think it would be fitting to write a letter to the author since Kandi Steiner told us a story that was aptly titled: A Love Letter To Whiskey. 
 Dear Kandi Steiner, 
 It's 2:30 am and I just spend the last three hours getting lost or in this case drunk on your lyrical and poignant prose. How can this one story consume me? Have me strangely intoxicated? Addicted? It's simple. One taste of your raw words was all it took. It didn't take much because shot after shot of your literary brilliance, you left me feeling numb, high and sated. I wanted to drown in whiskey. I wanted to feel whiskey. I wanted to be vulnerable to whiskey. I wanted to love whiskey. I wanted to hate whiskey but I couldn't because whiskey didn't consume me. It was your words Kandi Steiner that I was addicted to. 
 ""It turned out a Whiskey stain was just as permanent as ink, and I wondered if I would ever truly wash myself clean. Or if I even wanted to."" 
 This story. These characters. These words. These emotions that you had coursing through my veins was the very essence of why I love to read. This was not a story of perfect characters but instead of flawed individuals who continued to make mistakes after mistakes. Individuals who hurt each other emotionally. So how could I be intoxicated on a story where cheating occurred multiple times? The answer to that is simple. Love is complicated. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is beauty. Love is truth. And the truth of the matter, love can be selfish. Love can be cruel. Love can be an addiction. Good and bad. It can be toxic. But love can make you feel. And the story of Jamie and B was a story that I will happily drown in over and over again. Why would I torture myself in such a complicated love story? Because love is meant to be consuming and a story that makes you feel every fiber of emotions coursing through your veins is a story worth remembering. And this is one love letter to whiskey where I will savor every last drop. 
 ""My first taste of Whiskey had been nothing. My first shot? Child's play. I'd been holding back, delicately balancing on the line, afraid of drinking too much --but this was it. I knew it. I felt every inch of the fall from tipsy to drunk. I was completely wasted, and all I wanted was to feel this way forever."" 
 Sincerely, 
 ~Michelle xo 
 Emotionally consuming. Intoxicating. Raw. Flawed. And breathtakingly poignant. These are the words that immediately comes to mind as I sit here in write my review for A Love Letter to Whiskey. Kandi Steiner honestly blew me away with this book. In the three hours that I was held hostage, I felt like I was on an emotional roller-coaster going through the motions and the unexpected twist and turns. In all honesty, I needed a drink after reading this book because my heart and emotions were scattered and beating wildly as I drank in every mistake, love, hurt, and loss the hero and heroine experienced. 
 ""Jamie was whiskey, that much I was sure of. I couldn't deny the way he burned, the way his taste lingered."" 
 That first taste. Once you had your first drop of love, it's a high and addiction that you can't forget. The buzz that you crave. For Breck, her addiction came in the form of a boy who knocked her world off its axis. The boy she knew who was top shelf material. Yeah he was that drink that was rich, smooth and left a good burn. And that drink was her very own whiskey named Jamie. 
 ""I was spinning, tipsy, teetering on the edge of being wasted on Whiskey. I'd dreamed of kissing Jamie so many times, but nothing could compare to how it really felt --his hands on me, so strong, his mouth skilled and passionate. My legs were weak and he felt it, taking the weight of me in his arms, kissing me like he'd waited his entire life to have the chance."" 
 Jamie and B's relationship was built on a friendship that was held by truth, love, and an indescribable connection. To sum it up, it was intense. But like any friendship when feelings are involved, lines would get blurred. And the timing of Jamie and B was never right.When she was single, he was in a relationship. When he was ready for her, she wasn't available. But as much as the timing was never right, their feelings were always there but miscommunication and timing was always their downfall. She wasn't ready to be fully consumed with whiskey even though she already knew she was drowning in it. 
 ""It turned out I was water, he was whiskey, and I couldn't dilute him --not now that I knew he loved me enough to let me. I needed to be stronger, to be ice the next time I melted with him."" 
 A Love Letter to Whiskey is an utterly raw gripping addictive read. This book was built on a symphony of raw emotions. Emotions that left you frazzled, confused, hurt, angry, sad, and wildly intoxicated. Steiner did not write an ordinary love story but instead a story that left you savoring every drop of her poetic and stunning prose. To the very last drop, you will want a taste of whiskey. You will want to know and experience a selfish kind of love. An addictive kind of love. And most importantly a love that is honest. Real. Raw. A love that leaves you vulnerable and breathless. And so if you are ready to take a sip and get your first taste of a literary masterpiece then I urge you to get drunk on this book. Take a sip, savor the taste, and enjoy the lasting aftertaste of whiskey or in this case Kandi Steiner's words. 
 ""Even if you must move on, please don't ever let us go.""

 ****5 BRAD DE LUCA STARS*** 
 Ahhh...I'm sad that the Innocence series is coming to an end. Literally, I devoured and consumed all three books of the Innocence series plus the Diary of Brad De Luca in three days. I was addicted to Brad De Luca and Julia. I never wanted their story to end and I wanted more. Hands down Ms. Torre's writing is captivating and spellbinding. When I read the last page of the epilogue, it was bittersweet for me. I hate to say goodbye to Brad and Julia. These two are unlike any couple that I have read. Their relationship screams passionate, hot, sexy, understanding, love, and trust. Brad and Julia's relationship is not your typical norm but they are still a committed couple even though they have a sexual preference of menage. What makes this couple stand out is that there is no jealousy...they are simply confident with their relationship. Their love is so strong that not even another person can come between them. They only have eyes for each other. 
 End of Innocence picks off where it last left off in Masked Innocence. Julia and Brad are back and PASSIONATE than ever!!! Ms. Torre was able to incorporate sex, love, trust, and suspense all in End of Innocence. Julia's new found sexuality is embraced. Brad finally found the one woman who can satisfy and complete him. Together they are each other's missing piece. All loose ends from Masked Innocence were wrapped up in this final installment. Ms. Torre did not just give us an ordinary predictable love story. She took us on one hell of a sexy rollercoaster ride that I didn't want to get off. End of Innocence concluded in Brad De Luca fashion. Readers are left holding their breath if Brad and Julia can weather any storm that comes their way. Is this lifestyle Julia wants? How strong is their love? Will Julia and Brad get their HEA? 
 I loved the transformation and growth of Julia's character..the once naive heroine blossomed into a confident, independent woman who knows her sexuality. Julia is no longer blindfolded but has her eyes wide open. She knows what she loves and that is Brad. She accepts this newfound sexual exploration with open arms. As for Brad, I absolutely love him. He is sexy, confident, and the man knows what he wants. He only has eyes for Julia and she is the only one in his heart. If there ever a couple who was confident in their love, it was Brad and Julia. 
 The Innocence series has made me a fan of Alessandra Torre. Her writing is flawless, brilliant, and spellbinding. She has a way to hypnotize her readers with every word. I find myself losing track of time because I am devouring her books in one sitting. Her writing is original. Her characters are real. Emotions expressed are raw and heartfelt. Passion and intimacy was felt. Alessandra Torre did an amazing job in developing Brad and Julia's relationship. It was fun, honest, sexy, passionate, fierce, and steaming hot. Brad is unlike any male hero...his presence in the book will make any readers sigh and swoon over him. Ms. Torre will amaze and captivate you with the Innocence series. She was able to conclude the story that left me smiling. So if you haven't read the Innocence series, what are you waiting for? Go meet Brad De Luca.. Like an addict who needs their fix, the Innocence series was what I craved.

112,17325147,5,"""Left Drowning is about friendship, family, sibling love, loss, abuse, faith, hope and overcoming your past, and love. Love all the characters in the book because they felt real and believable. You felt their pain, sorrow, loss, and love. 
 ""Don't you see, Chris? You and I are supposed to be together. There is always a choice. This is not an obligation or a duty. But our lives are entwined, they have been, for good reasons. I've known that from the moment I set eyes on you. It never made sense to me before. How I felt so deeply connected to you before we'd even spoken. But I did, and I do."" 
 Left Drowning is an emotional compelling story of Blythe McGuire who lost her parents in a tragic house when she was 17 years old. Her brother, James and her were luckily able to escape and survive the tragic accident. The loss of her parents has tragically shaped and changed the lives of Blythe and James. Four years later, Blythe is a very sad, self depreciating damaged and depressed girl. She's been living in a numb, almost lifeless state until she meets The Shepherd siblings. (Sabin, Chris, Estella and Eric) 
 She meets Chris Shepherd. She feels an inexplicable connection to Chris, and he brings out feelings in her that she has long since buried. Along with Chris' two brothers, Sabin and Eric, and their sister, Estelle, Blythe is saved from drowning. They teach her to breathe again. The Shepard clan becomes the family she is missing. Along the way, Blythe reconnects with her brother James and other close family friends. Blythe learns to take charge of her life. Chris gives Blythe hope.. 
 However, Chris and his family also have demons in their past. Blythe wants to be there for Chris, to help him like he did her, but he keeps her at arms length. She makes him feel too much, makes him remember his troubled past, and he doesn't want that, he only wants to move forward with his life. They both have emotional and physical scars. Blythe and Chris past and future are connected. Although, they don't believe in faith and God but they were destined to meet each other. Their physical scars fits together like a puzzle and they were meant for each other. 
 ""I am overwhelmingly in love with you, Chris says as he matches my steps. ""I've spent most of my life thinking that my father never gave me anything but pain. But that's not true. He did give me something. Someone. You. He gave me you. Last summer, you asked me to believe in us. I don't believe in much, as you know, but I do damn well believe in us. Forever.""

118,31549837,5,"""Wow. Wow. WOW! This book was SO freaking good. 
 I am struggling to put in to words how much I loved this book. I've just spent the last two hours finishing it. Reading it nonstop because there was no way on this earth I was putting it down. The angst was off the damn charts. My heart still hasn't stopped racing. 
 ""But sometimes, even when we know something is bad for us, we do it anyway.. Maybe for the thrill, maybe to cure our curiosity, or maybe just to lie to ourselves a little longer."" 
 I had no idea what to expect from this book. Honestly, my hopes weren't that high but I wanted to give it a try anyway. I couldn't have been more blown away! The books storyline is something I'd normally shy away from because it irritates me, but I was hooked. 
 A Love Letter to Whiskey centres around the life of B and Jamie. And by life I literally means 10 to 15 years of it. Meeting as teens, these two have the craziest, most insane life together.. and apart. I loved them from the first page, and was rooting for them for the entire duration of the book. I really can't go in to too many details because this is one of those books where you just have to find it all out for yourselves, but suffice to say, this book has it all. Ups, downs, emotions, angst... everything. I was on the edge of my seat, reading at lightning speed, because I had to find out what happened next.. and fast. 
 At times I wanted to throttle the characters, bang their heads together, or just lock them in a room until they sorted their shit, but what kind of story would that be? Ultimately, everything they went through, that made me want to tear my hair out, absolutely made this book. 
 ""I think sometimes life is about embracing what hurts, because pain is one of the most vivid emotions we can feel. Pain reminds us that we are alive, and I'll always appreciate that stinging reminder."" 
 I've never read a book by this author before but I thought her writing was incredible. I fell in love with the characters as soon as I started reading the book, and I fell in love with their story just the same. This is a book that will easily make it to the top of my favourites list and I can't recommend it enough!

119,20959438,5,"""It's official.. Nicole Reed is a genius. I fell in love with her writing in her first series, The Ruining Series, and since then her writing has got better and better. Beautiful Ink was out of this world. The writing was flawless, the characters were interesting and the story was captivating. I was glued from start to finish. It has been a long time since I have fallen in love with a book and its characters, but I did, 100% with this book. 
 ""This is for those who carry a piece of their soul inked out lovingly on their skin."" 
 CHILLS. I hadn't even got to the story, just the dedication, and Nicole had already given me chills. I knew immediately that there was no way I wouldn't love this book. And then I read the prologue and I knew I was done for.. I couldn't wait to carry on and just devour the whole thing. This book takes all sorts of things I love, throws them together, and takes you on one of the most amazing rides. We've got an MC club, a tattoo artist, a hero coming along to save said tattoo artist and a whole lot of twists and turns. I loved it! 
 ""Diamond showed me the beauty that lies within the art of tattooing. If you respect the magic, appreciate the art, and forge yourself in the blood, a piece of your soul lives with another."" 
 It's so hard to talk about this book and the storyline without giving too much away. Nicole has created a story that has so many twists and turns that giving away part of it, would reveal a whole lot of the other parts. What I can say is that the way in which she has told this story is just clever. We have mixtures of past and present, different sets of characters, and we are always wondering if and when the past will catch up to the present, with everybody in one place. It was edge-of-your-seat stuff. 
 I loved every single character in this book and often felt myself torn over whether I should in fact like this character or that. There were 'bad guys', the ones we were meant to like and the ones we couldn't help but love, regardless of their actions. The situations these characters found themselves in were, at times, heart breaking. Not one person had an easy time in this book and Nicole really showed that. There were no easy choices for the characters to make. 
 ""You deserve respect and love and everything your heart desires."" 
 ""You need to live your life instead of watching it pass you by."" 
 I am so looking forward to the rest of this series, whatever those books may be about. Whether they are about the same characters, or some of the secondary characters, then I know I am going to love it just as much. Nicole's writing and story telling ability is out of this world and I feel so lucky to be reading it.

 I think I've said this before--really not sure though--but my main issue and prerequisite for biker novels is the believability factor. This is a world I'm not familiar at all, so for me to dive and get sucked in, it has to feel real to me. Obviously, this one unfortunately didn't. It had something to do with the plot, story development, character dynamics, and dialogue.

121,13449677,5,"""I love it when authors switch it up to the guys' POVs and I have to say that this has to be my most favourite among all the other novels I've read that included a guy's POV. Dante Walker is an ass. I swear, he's the cockiest, most arrogant and egotistical bastard I've ever met. And I love his bad-to-the-bones ass.

 Even though I'm half asleep, I wonder if she's checking me out in my boxer briefs. Then again, who wouldn't check this out? 
 ---- 
 I glance in the mirror. Surprise, surprise---I look finger-lickin' delicious. 
 If it wasn't for reminders here and there, I would've never imagined that all the things that happened in this book just happened within 10 days. Being inside Dante's head provided me a whole new perspective on what the ""reformed"" bad boys really go through once they've met THE girl. And his road to redemption and love was just oh-so beautiful and profound. 
 I couldn't even remember how many times I laughed out loud with his inner ramblings and egotistical self-praises. But what I loved most was his transition from being Charlie's corruptor to her protector. It was like I actually witnessed the wheels turning inside Dante's heart and mind whenever he goes on full attack mode against anyone who hurts and offends Charlie. At the same time, you also feel the change in him when he starts to take notice of Charlie's real beauty as well. I even teared up during that scene in Vegas when Charlie in all her drunkeness, opens up to how much she sees the goodness in Dante and he just stares at her in awe as he felt his heart slowly opening up to a whole new feeling. And then he finally falls for her... 
 I stare at the note and try to decide how to sign my name. Dante? Love, Dante? Obsessed with you, Dante? I feel like a freakin' twelve-year-old, like I'm seconds away from zits and wet dreams.

 Don't let her kiss anyone, and I'll start being a better person. I'll eat vegetables. Save baby seals.

 Charlie was the perfect heroine. She's not your typical beautiful-girl-who-everyone-adores but with her spunk and big heart, you just know that she's the perfect match for Dante in every way. I mean come on, if you managed to turn a self-centered super badass demon into a selfless and lovesick puppy, you just have to be incredibly awesome right? And she really is. 
 All the other supporting characters including grams, Annabelle, Blue, Max, and Valery, also contributed in the overall character dynamics and they really complemented each other as well. And even though Dante isn't your typical perfect swoon-worthy lead guy and Charlie isn't your usual physically-perfect girl, I still completely adore their journey together and I can't wait for the next installment in this series!""",2013-03-07 05:13:14,"The Collector (Dante Walker, #1)","young-adult,fantasy,paranormal,romance,fiction"

123,8683812,3,"""I'd consider this book about Ernest Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, somewhere between biography and historical fiction. The author obviously based the story on facts and real correspondence, but chose to embellish the narrative by writing in first person as Hadley. I'm not sure I understood the point of doing so. Author McLain offers little introspection into Hadley's thoughts or feelings, and Hadley comes across as one-dimensional. Even as a secondary character, Hemingway himself pulls more of the focus of the novel. Hadley seemed like an afterthought, like a companion to Hemingway's strong personality. Maybe she thought of herself that way. 
 I found the descriptions of an artist's life in 1920s Paris fascinating: philosophical conversations in smoky cafes, spontaneous trips to Spain for inspiration, and a constant fog from too much alcohol. I enjoyed reading personal accounts (albeit somewhat fictionalized) with Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. They were idealistic artists, celebrities of their time, and they were as provocative as any ""Brangelina"" celebrities of today. 
 But the setting can only carry a book so far. As mentioned, I couldn't empathize with Hadley because McLain didn't bring her to life. There's not much plot movement, other than watching Hemingway become an author and their marriage become dissolved. Hemingway behaves questionably, but I struggled more with why Hadley allows him to continue. 
 I don't regret reading The Paris Wife, and there are some redeeming qualities, but overall I didn't find it very affecting.""",2011-11-08 13:41:37,The Paris Wife,"fiction,history,historical fiction,biography,romance,non-fiction"

 Rothfuss is so good at getting Kvothe's emotions across without actually telling us what he's feeling. I love how this book falls comfortably into parts -- the part where Kvothe lives in the forest and masters the lute, the part in Tarbean, the part when bonetar nearly burns down the Fishery, the part with the draccus. It is so authentic as a story being told as a personal narrative, because it sits in my mind like that after I've read it--a story, a slice of life, with a bunch of different adventures wrapped up in it. But it has a very strong overarching narrative, and strong characters, that pull you through and keeps the parts from feeling at all episodic. 
 The part that I love best about this book, though, is the one that hasn't happened yet. The part when Kote, the mild-mannered innkeeper, becomes Kvothe again and picks back up his sword. So, if you're reading this Pat, there better be a Day 4 or a second trilogy!!

 I'm not gonna give the synopsis of this book because it's a sequel and I don't wanna spoil anything for you guys who didn't read the first book yet. 
 Expectations 
 After reading the first book of this series, (Marked), I had the following expectations of the sequel book Betrayed: 
 - A similar progression of the story already introduced in book 1; 
 - A bit predictable events; 
 - Expanding on the background of Zoey. 
 Review 
 My expectations were not quite what is going on in book 2 of the House of Night series 
 It is true that the story continues where the story ended in book 1 and there are some predictable moments, but also surprises. I find this a pleasant change within the story.There are several moments in the book that I really could not predict what would happen. 
 Personally I find it a bit hard to believe that Zoey knows exactly what they should do with the elements and how they should call on the Goddess Nyx. Everything is a going as it should be. A bit too much of a good thing. The authors show two different sides of Zoey's caracter. The one where she always knows what to do and one side where she's very unsure about herself. I find this a bit contradictory.

 That was one pile of pseudo-religion mainstream diarrhea trash that does so much injustice to the book, you should ask to have your memory deleted if you've ever watched it. 
 Now the book. 
 Simple, proper horror. The author portrays the feeling of loneliness and despair in a very vivid, touching way. The way the protagonist responds to the dog, and then the sight of ... let's not spoil, are harrowing, brutal, elemental, heartbreaking, disturbing, beautiful. 
 The research part is probably the weakest link, as it tries to justify something that cannot be reasonbly explained with proper science. But then, it does give the protagonist something to hold on to and maintain his sanity as he tries to survive in a vampire-ridden world. 
 The ending is epic. There's no better way to describe it. 
 All in all, for a work of art written some 70 years ago, it feels remarkably fresh and modern and relevant in every little aspect. It might have been written today, yesterday, 10 years from now, it has that immortality of all great works. Again, the science piece is a bit loose, which is why one star must come off, but other that that, these are absolutely smashing 150 pages of emotional horror and class. 
 Indeed, it is a legend. 
 Remember, don't watch the film! The book is infinitely better.

145,23377551,3,"""Brantley has suffered something horrific three years before she moves into an apartment above Myles Franco. Myles has attitude the first time he meets Brantley and Brantley gives it right back to him. Myles is surprised since he is not used to a woman actually standing up to him. First Myles has his own negative opinions about Brantley as Brantley does about Myles, but as time goes by they begin to see that what they show to the outside world is not actually what is on the inside. 
 Brantley works as a bartender at a pub, taking double shifts just trying to survive. Myles has his own secrets, but when these two meet there is an attraction and then a comfort that they both take in each other. However, something happens and then the security and faith that one character felt for the other is broken and it takes them to a different path. 
 There was a lot of unnecessary information about the secondary characters that I think could have been deleted. I did not really need to know about how Brantley's cousin, Jen and her fiance David met, etc. Then there was a lot of information about the best friend, Livvy. A little detail is fine, but sometimes a lot of information about secondary characters gets in the way of the actual plot and I lose interest. 
 Also, I am not sure if I really cared for any other the main characters. 
 This story is written in dual POV and the switch is every other chapter. I think the switch in POVs happened too quickly. There were points in the book where I had to think about whose POV I was reading. 
 The premise was there I just think that some of the unnecessary detail and frequent switch in POVs took away from the story. One thing I did like about this story is that Brantley did not back down and just accept a ""sorry"". What was done was wrong and I completely understood Brantley's words and actions toward Myles even though I could not understand why he did things the way he did. I think Brantley showed her strength in those scenes. Some of those scenes were very well written because I felt her emotions. However, majority of the time the unnecessary information took me away from the main characters.

She's more focused on her budding romance with the school outcast, Ollie, until a second murder strikes fear into everyone in town. Maybe Makani lying so she can spend more time with Ollie is putting her in even greater jeopardy, since she might be next on the killer's list. She hasn't told anyone the reason she moved from Hawaii to Nebraska, and the killer seems focused on offing students who stand out in some way. 
 I know 3 stars seems like a low rating - I think I might have had my expectations too high for this book. At the Boston Teen Author Festival a couple of weeks ago, one of the authors was talking about subverting tropes and how this novel didn't, it was just a perfectly executed thriller. So I knew going in that there wasn't going to be a twist at the end, that it was a straight teen slasher novel. There are definitely some wonderfully creepy moments, which scarily resemble one of my worst nightmares, wherein the victims discover common objects in their homes moved around. It's definitely a great thriller, and the pace kept me turning pages. 
 In relation to the trope conversation above, I think there are a lot of young readers who have never read a straight thriller, and so for them this is new, but for me this is simply a better-written version of the R.L. Stine and Christopher Pike novels I devoured as a teen. Honestly I kept waiting for a twist, especially after they figured out the identity of the killer about 60% of the way through the book. The hot pink of the cover text and book design led me to believe the killer had to be Ollie, who has pink dyed hair . For some reason, the movie ""Scream"" kept coming into my head, and I figured there would be two killers. I also expected, from the title, that the grand finale would happen inside Makani's house. It happened in a haunted corn maze, which was fantastic, but again I just expected something different . I also expected, after Makani reveals the reason she left Hawaii, for that to somehow come into play. The killer's reasoning felt a little weak and I wanted it all to be more connected somehow, more so than it was. 
 So, I am giving this three stars because it was enjoyable to read and well-written, but didn't do anything new for the genre.""",2017-01-09 06:29:02,There's Someone Inside Your House,"young-adult,mystery,thriller,crime,romance,fiction"

 Fall of Reach is a prequel to the original Halo: Combat Evolved story and gives amazing insight on how John 117 came to be. He definitely has more of a personality in the book, so it was good to actually see that. 
 As the title of the book indicates, this story goes into detail about the events leading up to when The Pillar of Autumn jumped into slipspace and escaped literal destruction from the devastation of Reach. Reach is the biggest military base humanity owns, and they fight valiantly, but the Covenant is just too powerful. They come full force at the planet and The Pillar of Autumn narrowly escapes.

 My brother loved this book. My brother usually has the same taste in dark fantasy as I do, but I just could NOT like The Name of the Wind. 
 It had a lot of great elements: red headed main character who is smart as a whip, the traditional hero's journey, an interesting love story, and a fascinating world. 
 Those elements just didn't add up. The writing was great. The MC was an asshat. Seriously, this guy is a total freaking idiot and that's okay. I mean, I love characters that learn over time, that change and grow. Kvothe did not change or grow. Basically, he just stayed a poor, vicious street orphan from the time his parent's kick it and throughout his entire college experience. 
 GOD, the stuff going on between he and Ambrose is just DUMB. I mean, sure, the first few times were funny. But it's like he didn't learn that lesson AT ALL. He just kept kicking that dead horse again and again and again. To my utter annoyance. 
 The other thing that doesn't thrill me, and this is just personal taste... I hate stories told backwards. I hate when the main character goes back to tell a story that happened in the past, because there isn't a lot of tension there. If the MC is telling the story, then you know they live. And you know that there's nothing at stake, really. I like life and death. I like worrying about my characters and feeling like I have an emotional attachment to the moment. It was really hard to get drawn into the story because of the way it is told. 
 That being said, the best part of this book is when he goes to audition at that musicians hangout. (Can't spell it to save my life, so I won't bother.) I was literally holding my breath that he'd make good. And he did. But then he ruined it completely by being an asshat and I pretty much lost interest after that.

 The Body Electric is set in the same universe as Across the Universe. There are many great references to Beth Revis' trilogy, and I absolutely love all those easter eggs. It brings back great memories and tempts me into reading those books all over again. 
 Ella Shepherd is desperate to hold onto her dying mother. Her mother, dying from a (thankfully fictional) disease called Hebb's, is barely surviving. (Note: I get nightmares and shivers from the way Revis describes the disease.) Ella is a seemingly normal girl whose parents are well-known among the science community. But one day, she jumps into her mother's tech-induced dream and changes everything in her life. Suddenly, Ella is thrown into a war she'd never heard of. What I love the most about Ella is how much she is tested and how well she manages to rise above it. No matter how far she is crushed, she strikes back. 
 Every character has its own agenda. The leader of the corrupt government is searching to crush the rebel group. Ella is searching for answers (about Jack and about the dangerous mystery). The leader of the rebels is focused on Ella, and I love how every character has its own purpose, their own (gloomy or bright) personality. Even their own dialect. It makes every character unique in their special way. 
 The plot unravels slowly, almost lazily. Ella undergoes a normal day, and readers are given a chance to see Ella's attempt at normalcy. Suddenly, a spark flies and everything changes. Ella discovers ""old"" friends, and she finds more questions than answers. I'm absolutely emotionally invested in Ella's search for the truth. I'm swept away into Ella Shepherd's world and her vast number of problems, and I ignore everything in my world. 
 The romance between Jack and Ella is very entertaining. Ella, after being mind-wiped by a mysterious and unknown person, meets Jack at her deceased father's tree. Thinking Ella still remembers him, Jack says and does the wrong things and scares Ella. Good amounts of drama ensues, and I love the way Ella slowly falls in love with Jack (again). 
 Overall, The Body Electric is a pulsing Science Fiction story that is perfect for fans of Across the Universe and Legend (by Marie Lu). With dark descriptions and many strong characters, The Body Electric is simply amazing.

171,16217442,3,"""The end of the series. Wahhhh! 
 I wish The Morning Star... Let's not start there, on second thought. Let's start in the background of the story. Once upon a time, there was a girl named Katerina Alexandrovna, who had the ability to bring things back from the dead. She was torn between so many choices. Love and dreams. Duty and love. Dreams and duty. Each and every book was always starring a war within Katerina Alexandrovna along with the war between someone. 
 Okay, that clears up a lot of the issues. The Morning Star is an okay book. Disappointing, because its predecessors fared so much better like The Unfailing Light and The Gathering Storm. The Morning Star, compared to the last two, didn't go into many details and wasn't as good. 
 The plot went by very quickly. Sometimes, in the middle of the book when I was reading it, I wished that the author would slow down a bit because everything went by a little too quickly. Like she was here, then there. And whoa! How did she get there? It's something like that along the lines. Crazy. Fast-paced. And insane, but overall landed on my positive thoughts. But disappointing was one of the negative thoughts on The Morning Star. 
 I like how the author did little recaps here and there, but I wish she expanded on them, because I can't remember everything about the last two books. Hello? That book was about two hundred, or four hundred books ago. It might as well be eons. 
 The ending. This is me for the entire ending: (O.O) Yes, that's correct. That face right there. For the entire ending, I was shocked, shocked, shocked. Then I was, what the heck did I just read. But of course, I'm not telling you anything, but it is worth reading the last part because it is just that good. And I'm left thinking that Robin Bridges should write some more of this series.

172,17325147,5,"""When we first meet Blythe McGuire, she's not living, she's barely existing at a small college in Wisconsin. Still grieving over the loss of her parents in a tragic fire four years ago, she shuts everyone out, spending her time going to class and drinking her nights away. She has an estranged relationship with her brother as she believes he blames her for the loss of their parents, so she is, on all accounts, alone. 
 Enter the Shepherd family. Y'all, if there's ever a fictional family that I want to be a part of, it's the Shepherds. The first Shepherd Blythe meets is Sabin, the flamboyant theatre major who helps draw Blythe out of her shell. In the same day, she meets his sexy older brother, Chris, and they fall into an easy friendship that soon turns to more. 
 Blythe and Chris are both jaded due to circumstances of their past. As Blythe begins to fall for Chris, it's evident that he feels the same, but it continuously resistant to pursue anything further than a friendship. He's so hot and cold that it's exhausting wondering which Chris is going to show up. 
 Can Blythe and Chris get over their tragic pasts in order to have a beautiful future, or has too much damage been done for them to overcome it in the name of love? 
 ***** 
 Five stars are not enough for this book! 
 I finished Left Drowning three days ago and I am still literally at a loss as to what to say about this book. No words that I can type could ever give this book the justice that it deserves. This book resonated so deeply within my soul that I will never forget a single moment of it, and I don't want to. Jessica Park did an amazing job in bringing every emotion I could ever possibly feel to the surface. She took my heart, ripped it out of my chest, stomped on it, stabbed it, and tore it apart. When I didn't think it was possible, she repaired my heart in the most beautiful fashion and I finished this book with the cheesiest, largest grin that could ever grace my face, while crying tears of joy at the same time. Seriously. This. Book. Is. Incredible. 
 Blythe and Chris have undeniable chemistry that sizzles through the pages. The way that they are immediately drawn to each other is beautiful, as is the progression of their relationship. They truly are each other's saving graces. They're like puzzle pieces; they're meant solely for each other to create the perfect fit. I can't begin to form the words to express how much I love the relationship of Blythe and Chris. 
 At one point Chris utterly and totally destroys me and I was left wondering... 
 Blythe's strength as she continued to heal was extremely admirable. She's now at the top of my list of favorite female heroines. I felt everything she did. I felt her pain, her sorrow, and her angst. I also felt her falling in love, her pain healing, and the familial love she felt for Sabin, Estella, Eric, and James. She may have been a zombie for the past four years, but with a little bit of help, she rejoined the land of the living, and I loved going on this journey with her. 
 I also need to give a special shout out to Sabin. He was probably the best secondary character that I've ever encountered in the literary world. He was just as important of a puzzle piece in putting Blythe back together again. He was the instigator, the push, the spark that she needed to begin living her life again. He was her person. And it was undeniably beautiful. 
 I read Left Drowning on my birthday, and I'm pretty sure I freaked my husband out. If there's ever a book to make you ugly cry, this one is it! After crying on the couch for over an hour, I made my husband go to the store and buy me a bottle of wine because my heart seriously needed some liquid courage to continue this story. Jessica Park's writing style is so effortless, and she writes in such a way that the characters pop off of the page and instantly grasp onto your heart. I connected with this book in a way that I haven't experienced in a very long time. 
 Don't let me scare you with my talks of all the crying and emotional wreck that I was while reading this book. This payoff is more than worth it in the end. If you take only one recommendation from me for the rest of my blogging life, Left Drowning needs to be your choice. I'll even mail you a gift package of Kleenex tissues and chocolate to help you cope. I'd send wine, but I'm not really good at sharing that. I'll even send a few free hugs your way. You're going to need them. 
 Amazing, heartbreaking, devastating, tear-inducing, beautiful story.

 Rating: 
 Dante Walker. He is one annoyingly hot, funny and arrogant guy. I honestly can't decide whether I would like to knee him in the groin or kiss him. However, what I can decide is that he was the perfect protagonist for Victoria Scott's amazingly original take on the whole heaven-hell-angels-demons genre. Dante basically helps Satan (or Boss Man, as referred to by Dante) collect the souls of humans who are major sinners and he doesn't mind - not a single bit - as it does have many benefits. 
 Although Dante does seem like your run-of-the-mill bigheaded bad boy, he's undoubtedly good at being one. He's got plenty of attitude and definitely seems completely carefree and self-absorbed. However, the little glimpses given into Dante's life before he died and started working for Boss Man revealed a surprisingly human and hidden side of him. 
 Despite the fact that Dante never felt remorse for taking others' souls and dooming them to an afterlife in hell, his newest assignment, Charlie Cooper, became a catalyst for his change of views. The main reason being that Charlie is an all-rounded good girl and Dante usually collect souls that aren't so angelic. Saying she was a breath of fresh air to him would be a crazy understatement. 
 I did love the vast difference between Charlie's and Dante's characters and that Charlie could see right through Dante's big personality. However, I felt her innocence was a tad overdone and at times it felt slightly unnatural, making it a little uncomfortable to read and process. 
 The uniqueness of Victoria Scott's adaptation of the whole heaven and hell/angels and demon theory made The Collector an utterly unpredictable read. It was so much fun discovering how things worked in Dante's reality and I would say this book was a favorite of mine in the YA paranormal genre. In fact, the pacing was also impeccable and I actually finished The Collector in 3 days, which was lightning speed for me as I read like a snail. 
 To sum this up, The Collector was hilarious, well-paced, original and had such touching yet fun romance. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, The Liberator, (hopefully) soon. But I do wish that Charlie will be a more realistic and believable character in the sequel while Dante... he can just keep being his obnoxiously attractive self. If you're looking for a quick, not-too-intense read, I would definitely recommend this!""",2013-09-01 06:08:13,"The Collector (Dante Walker, #1)","young-adult,fantasy,paranormal,romance,fiction"

178,186074,5,"""If I could give this book another five stars, I would. 
 There are few things in life that I treasure more than a fantastically written piece of fantasy. 
 This book happens to be one of them. 
 The impetus that led me to read this book started with a decision to make a concerted effort to find something new to read. I was in fantasy book limbo. I had not started a new series in a few years - and those I've tried largely fell flat by book two - and was instead stuck in a circular habit of re-reading old favourites. 
 Which led me to a list on the internet that in so many words, listed the best fantasy books of all time. 
 Many of those books high up on the list already were on my 'read' list. This was the exception however, a revelation that intrigued me enough to start considering adding it to my 'to read' list. 
 As fate would have it, by about the time I decided to seek it out, I found a copy in a second hand book store, too good an opportunity and too fortuitous a find not to purchase it and start reading it. 
 And so this was the beginning of something very special. 
 The characters are interesting, the story-telling is sublime and the concept is familiar to fans of fantasy, both in a coming-of-age sense as well as in the trials and tribulations of one's life journey. And yet somehow it still managed to largely avoid the heavily cliched tropes of fantasy that has since mostly exhausted the genre (and its fans) to a point of almost severe aversion. (And is a large reason why I ended up in fantasy book limbo to begin with) 
 The world-building is fantastically magical but not so much to lose its sense in its own spell. Somehow it stays fundamentally grounded on ""human"" logic that makes it believable enough for those who have grown ""attached"" - for lack of a better phrase - of the grittier realisms of George RR Martin. In doing so, it makes it immediately attractable to all degrees of fantasy fans. 
 It is not devoid of its dark moments - with darker to come if foreshadowing indicates anything - but it is at the heart of the book a rather wry tale told with an underlying humour. I would go so far as to say it is almost a bit sarcastic, as if the book is attempting not to take itself too seriously. Which simply adds to the character of the tale as a whole. 
 It is a book I would recommend again and again to anyone who asks for a book recommendation in the genre (and even outside it). It is something that I would freely converse and debate about to any who'd care to argue the merits of the story and the setting. 
 Ultimately, the book in of itself is more than just the beginning of a story, it is the beginning of a great many wonderful things. 
 And is a gloriously written introduction to the world of Kvothe and the wit of its writer Patrick Rothfuss.""",2012-07-01 23:54:38,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)","fantasy,paranormal,fiction,young-adult,romance"

 Easily the best high fantasy book I've read since Game of Thrones, or when younger, books like LOTR. Basically, it's up there. 
 The first 70% of the book I could not put down. The lyricism of the first page had me entranced. Some of the most beautiful writing ever: 
 'He moved with the subtle certainty that comes with knowing many things. The Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. It was deep and wide as autumn's ending. It was heavy as a great river-smooth stone. It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.' 
 I read the prologue and thought Yes this is the book for me. It's gorgeous. It's the story of Kvothe, who we meet when he is being an innkeeper, but that is not who he truly is. 
 I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe Kingkiller. I have earned those names. Bought and paid for them. 
 But I was brought up as Kvothe. My father once told me it meant ""to know."" 
 I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned. 
 I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. 
 You may have heard of me. 
 I can't even. This book is awesome, and is the story of Kvothe telling his own story. He is upfront about the fact that stories are embellished or changed etc. which I loved. An unreliable narrator is an interesting one. 
 But what is excellent about this book, well from what I've tried to work out anyway- is how real and raw it is. 
 This is a story, but it's a story of a man's life. It doesn't have to have direction or purpose. He has a promising start but has his future warped by tragedy and murder. 
 ""Think of all the stories you've heard, Bast. You have a young boy, the hero. His parents are killed he sets out for vengeance. What next?"" 
 Bast hesitated, his expression puzzled. Chronicler answered the question instead. ""He finds help. A clever talking squirrel. An old drunken swordsman. A mad hermit in the woods. That sort of thing."" 
 Kvothe nodded. ""Exactly! He finds the mad hermit in the woods, proves himself worthy, and learns the names of all things, just like Taborlin the Great. Then with these powerful magics at his beck and call, what does he do?"" 
 Chronicler shrugged. ""He finds the villains and kills them."" 
 ""Of course,"" Kvothe said grandly. ""Clean, quick, and easy as lying. We know how it ends practically before it starts. That's why stories appeal to us. They give is the clarity and simplicity our real lives lack.' 
 I can't finish this review now. I will in a few days. Just- read this book.

 I am a huge fan of the Argeneau series. I love the uniqueness of Lynsay Sand's version of vampires. I have this thing for authors that use different ways of depicting vampirism. The Argeneau series is fun and always easy to read. As many of the books that I have read it hasn't gotten old yet. It is one of the few series that I usually purchase the day that it comes out. That's saying a lot if you ask me. So if I'm such a huge fan why on earth am I reviewing book 1? Because I felt like reading something like the Argeneau series and after failing to find something recommended that I haven't read already I decided hell I'll just re-read this one! 
 What shocked me almost from the start is that I barely remember this book. I originally read it almost exactly 2 years ago. This story is about Lissianna and Greg. It's sort of an introduction to the Argeneau. There are some things not included in this book that must have evolved some to the series in later books. It features my favorite matchmaker Marguerite Argeneau. She is the mother of Lissianna and she kidnaps Greg to help Lissi with her phobia. Lissi is a vampire that faints and the sight of blood. Just that premise lets you see how comical these books are. But they are also very romantic as well. It was really fun reading about characters from later books such as Thomas, Mirabeau and Jean Louis. 
 Although this is a good introduction to the Argeneau's I wouldn't rate it as my favorite book in the series. I would have to say that award would go to Marguerite's book. It's still a great book and I love Lissi and Greg. So if you like vamp books and are looking for something different than this might be for you! Just keep in mind it is meant to be humorous. I get sick of reading reviews for this series giving it a hard time. If you like the Love at Stake series you will love the Argeneau.

 When I started this book, I did not realize how dark this book would turn out to be. It is told mainly through the eyes of Oly who is older now and no longer traveling with the circus.

Arty gradually becomes something of a traveling evangelist, becoming the leader of a strong cult following of people who yearn for something else from their lives - something out of the ordinary, the need to belong to an exclusive group of those who do not belong in the normal world.

The beginning was very intriguing which I think is why I kept reading it. But by the end I was skimming just to be done. I had been meaning to read Renee Carlino's books for a little while. Didn't know which one to start with I chose this one because the synopsis did sound really good. This review has a ton of spoilers in it so fair warning now. If you really want to read this book and don't want to be spoiled and know important plot elements please don't read below. 
 **************** 
 We have Charlotte a protagonist I really liked mostly because she was a damn mess and it's really refreshing to see a main character in her twenties who doesn't have her life together. Charlotte meets Adam and they have a really weird and sweet night together. When we are first introduced to Adam he seems kind of spacey. He doesn't remember much. I figured this might be like a 50 first dates situation where he has a short term memory problem. After spending the night together Adam is weirdly pissed at Charlotte and she leaves. Charlotte then joins match.com meets a nice guy there and he stands her up. Flash forward six months. She meets match.com guy again who is a hot baseball player. He's super boring and I don't really care about their relationship but I'm sticking around to see what happened with Adam. Charlotte goes on a wild goose chase and eventually meets his neighbor who in turn tells her Adam has a brain tumor and is currently dying in a hospital. 
 This is where I start to not like this book. And here is my very long list of reasons: 
 1. Cancer as a plot device. 
 That is so overdone at this point like can we not? Didn't Nicholas Sparks already beat this dead horse enough? I also really hated that that was like a twist. If I had known going in that this was a cancer book I wouldn't have read it. Both my mother and my grandmother died of cancer so I have a really hard time romanticizing it. 
 2. Manic pixie dream boy. Oh, my god! Adam was the epitome of the MPDB. He was spontaneous and weird but he's also hot and rich and in his final days he takes Charlotte to France and teaches her to sail and they fly on private jets and have an on-call doctor. Um...seriously? Like I said romanticizing cancer. Also I felt like the only purpose Adam served was to develop Charlotte so she can 'find her way. Like wtf? 
 3. The other dude. So like at first I was indifferent to him. He seemed fine but I knew he wasn't the star of the show here so I didn't get attached. But then after the dude dies she meets this guy again and oh they get married...awww. Are you kidding me?

She hoped the one thing she cherished the most, her Grandmother's rose ring, could be saved but it was very valuable and was also sold.

 The Collector is book one in the Dante Walker series by Victoria Scott. I was first introduced to Ms. Scott when I recently read Fire and Flood and immediately fell in love with her and vowed to go back and read this earlier series. And after I finished this first book I can say that I was most definitely NOT disappointed. 
 Dante Walker is a collector. He collects souls for the Boss Man that lives ""downstairs!"" Dante lacks nothing in the self-confidence department. He's good at his job and he knows it. But his latest assignment is the biggest of his two year career. He has been given ten days to collect the soul of Charlie Cooper. If he completes this task, he will get to stay ""above ground"" for good. No more fiery pits of hell. And he has complete confidence that he will complete this task. His future depends on it. Charlie will be putty in his hands, or will she?! 
 Charlie Cooper is good. She has a pure soul. When Dante first meets her, she is not at all what he expected. She's a tiny little thing and a total nerd. She has frizzy hair, walks with a limp and has crooked teeth. But as Dante gets to know her, he realizes that Charlie's beauty is within. But, he cannot figure out what Boss Man wants with this girl. Still, no matter the reason, he is committed to getting Charlie to give up her soul. 
 ""I like the sound the world makes,"" says Charlie. 
 ""But as I watch Charlie listen to her favorite station, I realize she has something most never will-peace."" 
 So when I first met Dante, I saw what he wanted everyone to see, a guy that is confident, cocky, and gets what he wants. But as I got to know him better, I fell in love with him. I saw the reason for his actions. And once Dante commits himself to something, he does not waver. At first it was to complete his assignment. But as he got to know Charlie his loyalties change. And when Dante falls, he falls hard. 
 ""My heart throbs, and I know it's over for me. I'm done. Putty in her hands."" 
 This book has everything, quirky humor, some heart pounding action, plenty of good guys and bad guys, and some of the sweetest moments. The two main characters won me over immediately. But we have plenty of fantastic secondary characters as well. Dante's best friend, Max, Charlie's two best friends, Annabelle and Blue, and Valery who is a Liberator which is what the soul collectors that work for the Big Guy upstairs are called. 
 This is a fantastic first book for this series and I can't wait to see what's next for Dante and Charlie.""",2014-01-28 06:14:21,"The Collector (Dante Walker, #1)","young-adult,fantasy,paranormal,romance,fiction"

Because Temeraire is naive but intelligent, she has the opportunity to question all the wrongs of Regency British society and colonialism, and to defend them according to the beliefs of the time. Maybe there are other writers who can evoke so much about time and place and character from the difficulty of finding suitable evening wear, but most writers overlook such prosaic material, particularly in a series that has war and adventure at its core. Brilliant stuff, deeply layered and truly thoughtful. I want to downgrade everything else, in order to give Novik more stars.

 **Potential Spoilers** 
 So I really hate to be the odd man out but I really did not like this story. It wasn't the story necessarily but Blythe's love interest Chris who slowly killed it for me. I know, I know, so many loved him but I just saw him as weak which is odd considering how strong he had been to take care of his siblings and survive his childhood. 
 ""Chris has the same unromantic view of the world that I do. I suspect that neither of us wants predictable march through life that includes things like marriage, kids, and a white picket fence. We both have histories that preclude wanting to seek out tradition.""- 
 Blythe 
 Blythe lost both her parents in a horrific accident. Since then, she's barely lived, doing only what she needs to survive but not enjoying life. She certainly has suffered like no teenager should ever have to. She carries a tremendous amount of guilt in regards to her parents' death and an injury that her brother suffered, that same fateful night. Years have passed but slowly Blythe begins to arise from the ashes. Much of this is thanks to Chris and his family, my particular favorite is Sabin. 
 The Sheperd family is just what Blythe needs. Having been alone and in her self-imposed hell of torture she has forgotten what it's like to live. They bust right into that shell and pull her out kicking and screaming. Her normal weekends would consist of binge drinking and fooling around with guys but only to the point of her turning them away when things started going too far. How could she let someone see her scars, both physical and emotional when she can't stand them herself. But the Sheperds give her not only fun and happiness but love, something that's been missing from her life for too long. And the feeling of family and belonging is not something Blythe ever wants to lose now that she's gotten it back. 
 ""There is nothing like trauma to make you see the world clearly, and not that I know there is no God, I cannot go back."" 
 -Blythe 
 I did not really like the story at all, the plot was interesting enough and I enjoyed the banter between the Sheperds and their family but at some point it became too much. Blythe was an admirable character and she was interesting to read about, but the whole romance with Chris was sort of a letdown. And Chris, I couldn't like him, I found him too weak. (To everyone who read and loved Left Drowning, please don't throw things at me.) Sure he had a shitty childhood but for someone who took the brunt of the pain in order to shield his brothers and sister, he didn't seem to have any sense of self-perseverance. In fact he seems to purposely think he is not worth anything even considering how far he has come. At one point in the story Chris became a monumental ass-hat. In my eyes and I could not get over the fact. It's one things for a weak heroine but Blythe who has been suffering with her issues for years manages to overcome then in a seemingly small amount of time whereas Chris doesn't even bother to try. I think at some point too it just kept going when it should have ended. There were some minor time jumps that I felt took me away from the story a bit but it wasn't far enough to thoroughly disconnect me. 
 So there were a few saving graces in Left Drowning. It was not a DNF for me but I few times I waved my kindle around hoping the end would be near. 
 Number one on my list is Sabin who is Chris's brother. She actually meets him first and every time he is just a joy to read about. When we first meet him I was excited thinking he was Blythe's love interest in the book. Chris was nowhere near as awesome. Let's just hope Sabin gets his own book and soon. 
 ""Dude, get a grip. And don't date anyone whose name sounds similar to mine. It's creepy.""... ""Well, shit, I hadn't thought about that. Chris, Chryslte... Oh, the tragedy! Clearly I cannot make juicy love to a woman ever again, for I would only think of you, dear brother. And that would be a sin of outlandish and vile proportions."" 
 - Chris and Sabin 
 The rest of the Sheperd family was pretty awesome. 
 Blythe's boldness in taking charge of her life-very commendable. 
 Chris is really a powerful motivator as long as he is not focused on himself. He pushes Blythe to her limits, making her face every horrific moment in her past in order to conquer her future. 
 I was shocked by the turn around with her brother and the truth he kept hidden. But it was bittersweet to see them work everything out and move past the accident without pointing fingers and forcing self doubt on each other. 
 I loved how bold Blythe became once her inner sex vixen was unleashed. Let's just say this girl has no problem letting out her inner slut when the time calls for it. 
 Blythe really grows throughout the story. She develops into an even stronger character. I was surprised by how forgiving she could be in both circumstances revolving Chris and her brother. 
 Another thing I didn't like was how everything seemed to work out so perfectly. I mean the world is not that small. But of course there is a connection between them that goes back, ugh, I just couldn't believe it. It was all too unrealistic for me. As soon as I heard the story from Blythe I knew there would be an almost unbelievable connection between the two. And as a Jessica Park fan it pains me to say that. 
 In some ways Left Drowning, drowned me with monotony and un-believability in almost 400 pages. I know, I really hate to say it but I felt let down after being sucked into the story and somewhere along the way my enthusiasm just drifted. 
 Overall 
 This story was really just a step above OK for me. I couldn't stop reading at the same time I couldn't stop disliking some of the characters more and more. I can't argue that Blythe is one strong heroine and makes the story bearable, as well as the rest of the Sheperds but I was disappointed by so many minor plot points that they were all I can focus on. I am desperately hoping Sabin gets his own book so I can jump back on the Jessica Park bandwagon because Left Drowning was just not my cup of tea.""",2013-03-13 12:50:05,"Left Drowning (Left Drowning, #1)","romance,young-adult,fiction"

217,2407022,3,"""Overall, I would have to say that I really liked the idea of this book, but I think the execution suffered a bit. The beginning, where Carmen and her family are moving to Mars and acclimating, is given so much room to breathe it feels slow. About a third of the way into the book I was still waiting for something to happen besides Carmen narrating the minutiae of her life. It also reminded me too much of Heinlein's ""Podkayne of Mars"", but wasn't similar enough to benefit from the comparison. Carmen isn't as smart as Podkayne, and her brother is just sort of there in the background rather than being a sociopath. Her parents are almost nonentities and the other secondary human characters are very shallowly drawn. 
 The plot twists and exciting moments are almost afterthoughts, in some cases literally. The book is narrated from the future, and at the end of nearly every chapter is a sentence-long description of whether what the characters thought at the time turned out to be right or not. A clever device, if used properly, but at the end of every chapter it just exhausted me. 
 And the climax of the book is almost literally an afterthought, a lazy attempt to wrap up the loose threads of the story. More time is spent on the details of how one would attempt to get her bachelor's degree via VR headset from a spaceship and another planet than is spent on the supposed crux of the book's plot. 
 But still, I liked the ideas presented, and I liked the author's take on a ""Martian"" race as well as a first contact scenario.

 This sat on my kindle waiting for me to read for a few months, but I finally got around to reading it. I knew up front it was going to be a 'hard' read(as in emotional roller-coaster.) There were parts I simply skimmed through and usually I'm hung on ever word by her. Not this time. 
 We pick up a few years later when we start. Rob and Matty live in NYC and are in love with each other. But both of them have issues. Matty's is his eating disorder. It controls his life and he only feels 'free' when Rob does a hard reset with him. Something Rob doesn't like, but will do to help Matty. Rob will do anything to help Matty, but he needs help himself. 
 Matty is coaching now and his star pupil is moving up the ranks and thus is moving to get more intense training from a well known coach. Matty's boss, Valentina is constantly putting him down, which isn't helpful. It's like a wound and she keeps ripping off the bandages before it has time to heal. 
 Rob is working as a physical therapist and well he loves his job, there are factors he doesn't love. He feels trapped. He hates the city life, it constantly puts him on edge and fantasies living on the open land again. He doesn't tell Matty any of his stressful worries though, because he feels Matty has a lot on his plate already and as his Dom he needs to just suck it up. He finally as an acquaintance (who happens to be living the BDSM lifestyle AND is a sports psychologist.) who gives him some advice. 
 Their stress levels reach an all-time high and bubbles over causing Rob to  say his safe word . 
 In the end everything is working out for them and they are both much happier than they have been in a long time. 
 Okay, so there was a part in the book where Rob takes Matty away for a mini vacation and there was one thing I couldn't get out of my mind. They go for a horseback ride to have a lovely picnic and all I can think about is...  Is Matty in the nude? Because Rob told him no clothes for the whole time... and if all I can think about is that must have been pretty uncomfortable for him...  
 I feel the author did a very good job with researching about Matty eating disorder and with Matty's inner thoughts, portrayed it well. I feel she did well with Rob's emotions trying to deal with until he breaks himself because there is only so much one can handle by themselves. I especially liked that Rob was the best anchor Matty could have asked for and well they had some big issues, they both remained in love and fought to keep their relationship together.""",2015-05-11 11:55:31,"Training Complex (Training Season, #2)",romance

 I just wasn't into this story as much as the first one. I did have some expectations going into this story. I wanted it to be as good as the first. Sadly, in my opinion, it did not. I really(still am) trying to root for team Tyler and his ex...Mitch... look, I can't even remember stunt man's name. I remember his ex wife's name(yup he was married) Julissa. She had more of an impact than he did. 
 Edit: His name is Memphis. See, I was wrong and I just finished this story today. He doesn't light my fire... though... that elevator scene was super HOT. 
 Okay, so Tyler's first boyfriend was his roommate from college. They even got their own apartment together. Then one day Tyler comes home to find him gone. Vanished, without a word. Nothing. Well, Tyler of course was devastated and played the 'what if' game. What did he do to wrong? His ex became a professional model/ stunt man. Fast forward ten years. The tabloids get Tyler's name. News is out, stunt man is bi and had a boyfriend ten years prior. Then the questions circulate. Did Tyler make stunt man straight?!? He goes and confronts him. 
 Stuntman, aka survivor of cancer twice, is a professional adrenaline junkie. He walked out and away from the love of his life ten years ago. Still, he allows cancer to control his life. He even made a bucket list. He was married, but divorced his wife, who happens be to his business partner. He got issues he needs to work out. He would love to be able to explain and get Tyler to forgive him. Stunt man, I just really didn't like him that much. I feel bad that about it, but I simply not loving him. So, here is the gist of what is going on  he finds a lump on his neck. Cancer. He doesn't want it confirm him. He doesn't want to go through it again.  He wants to just live life to it's fullest. But he can't because he is being held back  because of his cancer . 
 Tyler isn't the same man he was ten years ago. He is more confident and in control of his life. He fights his attraction for his ex as long as he can... but even afterwards he needs to push his ex to do the right thing. His ex keeps running away but this time Tyler won't let him. 
 Then we have the ex-wife. Of course I didn't want to like the ex... but really she is great. She is in the story some, but I don't feel she dominates from the sidelines. She is caring and determined and the female version of Noah. 
 I simply didn't care if Tyler and his ex got back together or not. I felt that that ship had already sailed. No matter the reasons, which in some I understand why it want down then. In fact, it probably helps that Tyler grew up some and became the man he is today. Stunt man came off as a bit childish in my opinions. Stunt man was had his good moments. I mean he jumps off buildings... that is pretty awesome. I just felt he needed some more confidence within himself before going to seeking Tyler. 
 The epilogue was good. It wasn't great news, but it wasn't the worst news. 
 Well, I will continue the series. I am hoping Noah meets someone as awesome. I just love Noah and his blunt(but caring) personality.  cutting his hair off and talking Dylan into it also. HAHA  His buddies are all moving forward into coupledom and he is the last one standing. Plus, he just deserves happiness too.

 Part I 
 connor:  I agree I ship him and rissa so hard haha. I understand rissa though, but the things that she feels for him just makes me think its just all the good parts of over unwinds. In my unsouled review I said that cam was starting to scare me, because he was getting anger from all of the parts.  
 Starkey:  I honestly dont think there is any hope for the storks unless starkey is out. He is just way too crazy and self obsessed to really care about anyone else. I agree with connor 100% when he says the storks arn't helping at all, they are making the AWOLS look scary  
 oh those advertisements are insane, but they totally seem like the ones we see. 
 Printer:  I understand why connor is hesitant to touch the printer because it is the only one there is, and I also understand that he needs to also get moving and try to figure it out. ""we need some stem cells"" ""okay I'll go pick some up at walmart"" looool that was so funny. I missed sonia.  
 Rissa  Rissa gives off a very different ribe than the first book, mostly because she has been through so much. I can't believe how strong she is and that she can still smile and laugh. When she said that there was no destination for the AWOLS it hit me. What are they going to do?  
 Basement:  That kid in the basement I forget his name, like bae or something lol. But he is scaring me. ""he would be a great leader if he would stop being full of himself"" (not an exact quote) but it was funny lol. I feel like he is going to have a big role. He is sticking his nose into their business and I don't think he will stay out of their way much longer.  
 part II 
 gardener :  it's interesting to have a different perspective.  
 Argent: really?! I think because I thought nelson was with him, I read fast and I don't really catch details so I thought nelson was the one who corrected him but it makes sense now.  
 Hayden and Jeevan:  Yeah I really hope they teach this tool a lesson  
 Risa  I keep picturing them at sonia's place looking for them and finding out that there is a basement since it goes to the exact inch.  
 Lev  Idk its a toss up, you dont know if they want to say out of it or if they think they have stayed out too long  
 Cam  yeah idk he still scares me big time. I have never liked him, and I am more afraid of him than anything. Part of me feels bad like its not his fault but then the other part just makes me think I like all the parts and not him. I am happy that he still hates Rebecca though. I can't wait for him to shut her up.  
 Part III 
 Sonia's  every time the group would seperate I would get excited that nelson wouldn't find them and then it was like dangit!  
 Cam:  well that was no surprise. But yet, I didn't expect them to be so ugly looking. Some details were shocking but most were obvious  
 Sonia's  I can't believe she broke it!!!!! I am nervous to see how Connor's parents act. So now that Connor is gone, Nelson won't find him but he will find risa and hope Connor will go after her? That's my guess  
 Part IV 
 Starkey:  that's exactly what I thought!!! But I thought they were against it?! Is the government the clappers??  
 Cam:  he saw Roberta go in there so he wanted to see. I think he wants to not let them happen which would be good, but I think he should like talk to them and use them  
 Sonia:  I love her so much! It still hasn't hit me... She cares about their lives more than her own and I love her  
 Grace:  yeah go grace!  
 Part V 
 Argent:  omg!!!! He is the server!  
 !!!!  I am in utter shock right now. Wtf Connor can't be unwinded!!!  
 Nelson:  When nelson started talking about connors eyes it hit me  
 thoughts:  yeah I can't believe all of this is happening. We just lost two main characters. I am hoping argent stole all of Connor and find someone to rewind him? Plus they said lev was still alive so your dream might still happen. 
 NELSON THO!!!! Yesssss! So happy he got a painful unwind, let's see how you like it buddy!!!  
 End 
 I am so glad we invented 3D printing before anyone could think of unwinding lol so hopefully this doesn't happen in real life""",2013-11-17 11:50:07,"UnDivided (Unwind, #4)","young-adult,fiction,fantasy,paranormal,mystery,thriller,crime,romance"

 Kite and Savvy meet in high school even though they don't run in the same circles. However they do catch each other's attention. Neither has great home lives and soon life's circumstances tear them apart. The major difference between the two is that Kite lets his past taint him while Savvy still believes the good in others.

Her father is in prison, her family gone, and with a secret tragedy that forever changed her, and she is trying to put a life together, to stand on her own. She is a hard worker and willing to do whatever she has to to make it on her own and owe no one. 
 Myles Franco has made a lot of mistakes in his past. He has now sworn off any females and has dedicated himself to his work. It is one thing trying to move on from his past mistakes but the problem is that those closest to him won't let him forget. 
 Brantley meets her new neighbor Myles under less then pleasant circumstances. Neither like each other, she thinks he is an ass and he thinks she is a b**ch. However there is no denying how each thinks the other is very pleasant to look at. Soon their runs in are less then friendly and filled with slamming doors. However, when a storm hits their town they are forced to actually spend some time together. 
 Brantley and Myles can not deny to themselves or each other the attraction they have. The question is can they let down their walls and share the secrets of their past. 
 I went into this one completely blind, no idea what to expect. I loved these characters and their stories. I will worn you this book is full of angst and miscommunication which usually irritates me but I loved everything about this story. I could not put it down.

 4.5 Lovingly kinky stars 
 This is the final installment in Brad and Julia's love story. These will always be two of my favorite characters. I love that Julia is a strong lead that doesn't suffer from the stupid decision that most female leads seam to fall prey to. She is level headed, thinks out her decisions, loves from her heart, and believes in communicating. 
 Yes it is true that there is nothing conventional about Brad but the one thing you can say about him is that he loves with all his heart and he will do whatever to save and be with Julia. What is great about Julia is that she is one that doesn't need to be saved but can save herself. But then she still loves the fact that she knows Brad is her safety and is always there for her. 
 In this book we get to know more about Brad's family (I will just say flat out I do not like his father and so wanted him to get his due) and Julia and Brad continue their loving yet unusual relationship, and for them it just works. I have really enjoyed Brad and Julia's journey together.""",2014-04-04 05:05:12,"End of the Innocence (Innocence, #3)","romance,fiction,mystery,thriller,crime"

 I discovered Fighting Destiny when I saw a few Goodreads friends reading it and thought, what the heck I will give it a try. I was hooked from the very first page and was dying to read the next book in the series. However, I used some self control since I had a ton of books waiting for me on my kindle to read and a bunch of ARC's to finish. However, while planning to leave on a vacation I thought what the heck now is a good time to treat myself and go ahead and read the next book in this series and see what happens to Syn. 
 So not disappointed. It is rare that a second book in a series is as good as the first especially when one has high expectations. This is one of those rare finds. I devoured this book, could not put it down. 
 Let me say I love Syn, she is a kick ass heroine, who is still very loving and very feminine. There is no resisting this woman. Syn has found herself a member of a world she was taught to hate, hunt, and kill. Now she is fighting turning into one of them. However, no matter how much she denies what she is there is not avoiding it. 
 Ryder is the man (Fae) she can't stay away from but she still doesn't fully trust him, yet he is the only one who can help her become who she is meant to be. I really don't want to go too much into the details of this book because it is filled with twists and turns, passion and surprises and I would hate to spoil any of them. 
 I will only say one thing..... YOU MUST READ THIS SERIES!! You will be so glad you did. It has everything, passion (lots and lots) romance, love, action, mystery. The supporting characters are almost as fantastic as the main ones. Trust me when I say you will be so glad you read this book.

 I read this book early last year and forgot to write a review until it was too late, so I took advantage of the long vacation to read it once again--thus, here I am writing this while feelings and emotions are still fresh. 
 It took me ages to finish this book the first time I read it and although I finished it a lot quicker the second time around, it still took me longer than how I usually peruse fantasy novels. The reason for this was the pacing of the frame story. See, Name of the Wind covers two timelines: The present, wherein Kvothe tells of his life story; and the past, the story being told. Truthfully speaking, I found the frame story a bit slow, too slow to my liking, that it took me ages to get past the opening chapters. I remember giving up reading the book multiple times because of it. However, once the real story began, the book became very difficult to put down. 
 ""I would pass over the whole of that evening, in fact. I would spare you the burden of any of it if one piece were not necessary to the story. It is vital. It is the hinge upon which the story pivots like an opening door. In some ways, this is where the story begins."" 
 Name of the Wind's magic was one of the things I loved most about it. Of course, there is ""knowing one's true name""--a concept that has been used in fantasy literature throughout history, but more importantly, I was fascinated by Sympathy. It was interesting how the author used concepts and laws borrowed from real Science and built a magic system around it--it can give you quite a headache too if you tried too hard to understand it. The school setting reminded me of Hogwarts, but not quite. Familiar yet foreign. I get why people see some similarities with Harry Potter but seriously speaking I think that's as far as it goes. Name of the Wind has its distinct charm that cannot be found elsewhere. 
 Overall, I enjoyed this book. The stories within stories were fascinating and absorbing. The world was carefully built, and although it took me awhile to be submerged in it, the dive was worth it. Rothfuss is a great storyteller. He has a way with words--his prose dances and flirts with you like music, and I think this element shines through the brightest whenever Kvothe speaks of Denna. You'll understand what I mean once you've read it.

 Ah yes, another one of my most anticipated books. I love being part of the VMafia (represent!) and I simply couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Everything about it intrigued me: how does ""sealing souls"" work? A demon book boyfriend? Female MC's a nerd? Sounds freaking awesome, right? Right. 
 This isn't just one of those books where the guy's impossibly hot and you'll immediately like him just for that. In fact, Dante's a douche - from start to finish. The only difference is he gradually focused his douchebaggery elsewhere as the story moved forward so he actually becomes less of a douche. But what's so likable about him if he's such a bad guy? His sense of humor. 
 I've never been average. I look like a movie star and move like an athlete. That didn't change when I kicked the bucket. It's okay to be jealous, to covet me. It's a delicious sin - tastes like chicken. 
 When I read that line it took me a while to get over it. Heck I'm still not over it. Dante was so funny that all the mean things he said didn't sound that mean. But he was still mean, let's not forget. Him being a demon and all. 
 I never got bored with the story because of Dante's narration that was both entertaining and witty. I also liked his whole transformation. Dante remained his funny self when he decided to go against the grain so I didn't feel like anything was rushed or unreasonable or overly dramatic. It was inevitable but it didn't appear all too dramatic (I thought it would). It was just right. 
 Then we have Charlie. I honestly didn't expect Charlie to be... well, an ugly nerd. I thought she'd at least be passable-but-quirky-cute and Dante would just fall head over heels for her. But he didn't... at least not right away. It took a long while. A makeover became all too inevitable once Dante kept commenting on everything he finds physically unattractive about Charlie. Just to give you just how unattractive Charlie is, here's how Dante described her: 
 This is the girl Boss Man is after? She looks like a porcelain doll... beat three times with an ugly stick. 
 Douchebag, right? But Charlie still saw through all that and he liked him for him. That's the most attractive thing about Charlie - her heart (cue ""awwww""). Oh man that's cheesy! I'm serious though. She's so sweet and forgiving despite going through a lot of crap. I liked how quirky she was and how simple it was to like her. 
 Insta love. Here's what I liked about the love story: Dante didn't fall in love instantly. I often characterize insta love by the span of time the leads spend together that I forget to consider how or why their feelings developed. It was clear that Dante saw the good in Charlie and she affected him greatly. He's a demon after all. It's like he got an intervention when he started spending time with Charlie. So I get that he fell madly in love with her. What I didn't get though was how Charlie was able to reciprocate the feelings. I know she's got a really good heart and she saw through Dante's mask from day one (day one!) but I didn't understand how she could return the same kind of love Dante felt. I just didn't. In fact, when Charlie started ignoring Dante and was being overly dramatic, I got super annoyed. It was just so confusing! She obviously has feelings for him but she's acting all weird. It was so not her. *rolls eyes* I'm just glad the book's written in Dante's POV. The love story made sense from his side. Charlie's? Not so much. I'm hoping for more insight from Charlie in the next book though. 
 Now the thing I wasn't so hot about was the big twist in the story that turned everything upside down. The story just blew up into a bigger thing that I don't think really fits well with how the story was going through the first half. Everything was all light in the beginning but when the conflict came it sort of gave the book a different feel. Plus, it was weird. Charlie becoming the light of the world who's going to bring peace for hundreds (I think) of years? A bit far-fetched if you ask me.  
 Anyhoo. I'm eager to see how the next book will turn out. There were so many things left hanging and we need lots of explanations! And Dante! Lots of Dante. ;) ---the creepy winky face. 
 I really liked it as a whole because there was never a dull moment for me. Even though I didn't quite like a few things here and there, what matters is The Collector kept me entertained. 4 stars for Dante and the awesome Victoria Scott!

 Ed Kennedy is an extraordinarily ordinary human being. Or so he thinks. He dreams of being something more, and fulfilling his own expectations of himself. He's lazy but unsatisfied. Until he stops a bank robbery and sets off a chain of events beyond his control. Now, is his chance to change the lives of people who desperately need it. 
 And it is a wonderful story of change and reaching your potential. Of making sacrifices to climb higher and of friendship and second chances. It's a whole package of goodness. But it also has a portion of ""mystery,"" and it doesn't really hold up to expectation. As Ed receives his instructions, he wonder who is directing him. Why? How? It's a pretty weird set of circumstances. But honestly, the curiosity never really hit me or made me frustrated. It was just a puzzle piece that didn't really fit. And it wasn't resolved clearly. 
 The confusion of the ""mystery"" was still the only problem I really found with this book. Otherwise, the characters leapt off the pages and the problems they all faced were palpable. Even the religious ideas in the book were inspiring and universal, not all-consuming or aggravating. It was very nicely written and the change in Ed was a gradual flow through the book. 
 I still have no idea how or why what happened came to pass. Maybe I need to give it another read, but the resolution was bland. The reasoning behind Ed's mission was almost meaningless; it added no real purpose to the story. The highlight was the individuals themselves and how Ed managed to help them.

 I liked some of it and some of it I did not. 
 Jenna comes into the book as a scared, beaten and brutally raped 16 year old. The book revolves around her and Kidd, a member of the MC and younger brother to Chipper who finds Jenna when he goes to the Metland club. To make things even more icky, Jenna was given, given to this scum who beat on her and raped her when she was 16 by her father. So when Chipper saves her for a while she is afraid she'd be sent back so she doesn't completely reveal who her father is, Brew who is the VP of the Metland club..yea. So Kidd has a thing for Jenna, but knows he won't act upon it until she is 18, but after her encounter with him on her birthday things change and Jenna has to make a decision, become an old lady or become a club whore. She chooses to become a club whore because she sees what happens behind old lady's backs and she doesn't want that. She has a place at the club and runs things herself etc. Kidd really screwed up with her because of the things he said to her on her 18th birthday ultimately brought her to her decision and also turned her to Ice. She won't talk to him or let him apologize for his major screw up. And what a screw up it is. So 6 years later after an incident rocks Jenna's world, Chipper asks Kidd to step in. So he does, because Kidd is now the Pres of the MC of all the affiliates as well. He decides to forcefully claim Jenna as his own and from there the story takes off. 
 For the most part it's interesting, I completely get why Jenna thinks the way she does especially with the way she was treated and had to live at a very young age. Kidd threw that to her because he was so pissed off at himself he threw her away.

254,19398490,3,"""Literary Fiction is difficult to pull off. It easily comes off as pretentious or superficial and, unfortunately, that is very true of All the Light We Cannot See. 
 Almost every chapter (of which there are over 100) ends with a whispering bit of prose that is clearly meant to make readers stop and underline and circle passages and draw hearts or exclamation points in the margins. Perhaps if chapters were not so short (which I actually really loved), or if Doerr chose to end some chapters with cliff-hangers, some with finality, some with those ethereal bits of prose that he loves so much, it would not have impeded his story as much as it did. Instead, those moments of prose become tedious instead of incidental and the more frequently they appear, the more obvious it becomes that each is a painstakingly created image. That ruins their grace. 
 It's hard to do well and there is something ineffable about the work that goes behind creating the kind of image that takes your breath away without make you roll your eyes. I did a lot of rolling my eyes while I read this book. 
 That said, the book is still beautiful. The story, a wandering examination of several lives impacted by WWII with a precious stone at its center, is compelling. Each character is flawed and strong and relatable. The undertones of the supernatural in the midst of what is otherwise historical fiction offer a really wonderful weighty levity (I mean, how else do you describe the supernatural darkness that drives the characters' paranoia about the curse of the diamond and its impact on world history and the characters personal lives?!  to the story. 
 Really, my only criticism is that this book would be better if it didn't take itself so seriously.

An invisible dome that suddenly and inexplicably cuts off a small Maine town from the rest of the world? How intriguing is that?

As I feared from the beginning though, even King couldn't come up with a reason for the Dome's existence that was as cool as it was.

 Sharon Ashwood gives good haunted house in her paranormal romance, Ravenous. 
 Ghost-busting grab student Holly Carver is a witch out to make tuition money, but the Flanders House is no easy job. Six people have entered the building, but none have emerged yet. So in goes Holly and her vampire partner Alessandro Caravelli to investigate. Work of demons is definitely afoot, but that takes some kind of sorcery, so who's the mastermind? 
 The author's website proclaims this as ""urban fantasy romance"". Ah...no. I much agree with the publisher's label of ""paranormal romance"". The first three chapters are intriguing, and Flanders House makes for one hell of an interesting read. But the rest of the novel doesn't live up to it, though there are worthy scenes here and there. 
 The problem lies mainly with the characters. Long-haired, leather-clad vampire Alessandro has superficial qualities (if you go for that unoriginal type), but otherwise I can't really describe his character. He doesn't come alive. Same with Holly, bordering on being a Mary Sue - three guys fancy her (including her 1 tru wuv, so the others have to be evil, right?) for no particular reason I can see other than she's there. And Holly has a lot of powerful magic, only it's crippled in the beginning. But of course it's conveniently restored for her to defeat the baddies, but I would've respected her more if her powers had remained handicapped. 
 A childhood accident led to Holly's magic being crippled, but for me her sister Ashe Carver deserves her own novel. She has the more interesting story: Ashe had magic, and then she lost it for good. So how is she dealing with paranormal problems when she no longer has her powers? 
 The author has the potential to write some really interesting stuff. But for now her characters need to step out from their prescribed cardboard cut-outs and become more like real people.

 I enjoyed this book. It was an easy, laid-back read that kept me entertained with its sweet story line. 
 Right from the start this book has my attention. Cameron is looking to let go for one night and it leads her to Aidan. Things then get interesting when she finds out he's her boss at her new job. I enjoy forbidden romances, I like the secrecy and danger element of being discovered and I think that side of things was created well in No Kissing Allowed. 
 As well as that, Aidan's commitment issues added another dimension they had to overcome. I felt for him and his views of himself, but I thought his growth was believable and steady. I grew to like him more and more as the story developed and by the end I didn't want to stop reading. 
 Which leads me to the only issue I have--and it's not really an issue, just a wish. I really wanted this book to be longer. It was a short read but I loved the author's style and it was so easy to get lost in. I wanted more from the characters who could make me smile and I didn't want it to end.

 This is one of those books that has been on my to-buy list forever. I finally got round to purchasing it last November and finally started and finished reading it a few days ago. It has split my opinion and I'm not sure I'm going to explain why as my head is a rambling mess, but I'll give it a go. 
 Overall, I liked Legend. It had a kick-ass female lead, a criminal bad-boy and lots of destruction in the dystopian genre. It started off well and the alternating points of view worked in this book, giving a good over view when the characters were apart. It also moved at a quick pace, with short chapters. I was actually surprised at its length when it came in the post as I thought it would be at least 100 pages more--don't know why I assumed it. 
 However, I think my main issue with Legend was that it was predictable. It would have probably been better if I'd read it when it first came out as I wouldn't have been so used to the genre but reading it now, it just read like every other dystopian book. It also didn't hold or conceal its secrets very well. I had guessed the ending at the twist way before it was revealed so I did find it lacking in that sense because I was right on every assumption. 
 Saying that, I probably will by the second book though as it finishes on an annoying cliff hanger that only sums up part of the book and I'm intrigued to see where it goes next.""",2013-07-21 03:21:45,"Legend (Legend, #1)","romance,fantasy,paranormal,fiction,young-adult,mystery,thriller,crime"

 What I liked about this book is that it does the frame story well. We get a glimpse of the main character, Kvothe, and hints of what he can do and what he has done. This then gives credibility to the fantastic details of the first person narrative, which otherwise would feel like just another tale. I like how the telling of the story impacts the present, and I hope that in the second and third books because he has told his story, our main character is empowered to move forward and do greater things. Because of the frame story, there's a hint of mystery throughout as we try to unravel the main character. 
 This book has a fun mix-up of classic tropes. The life of the bard, the life of the inner-city impoverished orphan, the life of the student at a school (university) for learning magic, and the life of a young adventurer. Because of the frame story, we know the main character is going to become a warrior, but it doesn't happen in this book. 
 I enjoyed the storytelling approach. It made it a fresh, fun read.""",2012-01-20 20:30:54,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)","fantasy,paranormal,fiction,young-adult,romance"
281,25854070,5,"""Warning: this novella kept me up late and made me cry and I want to hug it and squeeze it and love it. It's also got that ""trapped in a blizzard with only one hotel room"" trope that works for so many people, including me. 
 Trevor is a successful artist, living in a small Colorado mountain town. He's also dying. He's been on dialysis for years, and the story opens with his doctor informing him that it won't help much longer. Trevor has a rare blood type and no kidney donor. He's preparing to fly home for Christmas to tell his wonderful family that he might not be around for the next one. 
 Marc is a workaholic attorney. When his brother outed him in his teens, his mother basically cut off her affection. She waited until he was eighteen to kick him out. Since then, he's constantly chased the next level of success, subconsciously trying to earn back his mother's love, even though he hasn't spoken to her in over ten years. He's driving home from the office when the freeway gets shut down due to a blizzard. He treks to a nearby hotel and gets one of the last rooms. 
 Trevor and Marc meet in the hotel lounge, and Trevor doesn't have a room. They chat for hours and eventually Marc invites Trevor to spend the night. Trevor seizes what he feels is his last opportunity to be desired, to feel alive and unburdened. Marc just falls for Trevor after one powerful kiss, and has ""an oddly strong desire to give this man everything he had, to make this the best, most memorable experience of Trevor's life."" 
 They have great sex, and they snuggle and talk and bond. Marc realizes how lonely he is, while Trevor sees it as a nice farewell to life. Trevor doesn't tell Marc that he's dying, you see. When Marc suggests that they spend a few more days together, Trevor agrees only after saying that it's temporary and can't mean anything. 
 I loved the gentle emotion in this book. Each man wants to give everything to the other in the short time that they have. Trevor especially wants to give Marc a happy Christmas memory, and to give him something to care about when he's gone. Marc, not understanding the true time limit, just wants to convince Trevor to give him a longer chance. 
 Even though their time together was short, I fully believed the affection they had for each other. The story doesn't end there. This is a romance and it does have a happy ending, but I won't spoil it. This was just a sweet (and sexy) emotional story, really done well. I loved it.

 This is my first book about a motorcycle club and Oh My! It definitely set the bar high for the next books I plan on reading. 
 It was an emotion filled roller coaster, fast paced exciting story! It took turns I didn't see coming and kept me on edge. I'm so glad I picked this up. I would definitely recommend it in a heartbeat! 
 Overall the plot was great and the characters were so pleasantly developed. I will say, Helen is one the most likable heroines I've stumble upon. She was strong willed and made the most out of the situation she was in. Plus, she's a badass with full sleeves tattoos. 
 Holder: 
 My heart went to Holder, he had me from the beginning. I felt like his heart was at the right place but the circumstances he was in didn't allow him to do more. Even though, he did go out of his way to do the right thing and that I appreciated. He was born into this MC lifestyle and I was able to understand why he made some decisions. I was kind of rooting for him throughout the story. 
 ""It's like I've spent my life waitin' for you: waitin' for you to grow up, waitin' for you to feel the same, and goddamn it, but I hate waitin'."" He gives a bitter laugh. ""You stole my entire world and I'm not sure how to live in it anymore.""

 Well, this book causes that effect. 
 Rothfuss writes poetic prose, you feel the rhythm of the words as they match with each other, paragraphs go smooth as you read, the word choice, the sentence patterns, the imagery and metaphors used: Nothing seems forced, it flows, naturally, it develops on your head as you read it and shows you everything the author wants you to see. 
 Characters are great, Kvothe is charming enough to feel his distress on his times of need, his joy and his desperation for acceptance of an ""impossible love"", his friendship and camaraderie.

286,186074,5,"""5 stars. This stands as one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. Review to come as soon as I can organize my thoughts. 
 Before I try to organize my feelings into a concise review, I first must thank Patrick Rothfuss for writing such a complex, vivid world with imperfect, relatable characters and imaginative magic. This was a treat to read. At first, I tried to force myself into reading this a small chunk at a time, but once I hit the 200 page mark, I was completely immersed in the story and lacked the self-restraint to continue taking it slow. 
 Rothfuss' writing style is something that I don't run across very often. Without being too descriptive, I saw the world as Rothfuss saw it. I saw every unwritten detail about the towns, the countryside, the sky. There was enough detail to create a world where I was able to fit seamlessly into it and fill in the gaps without being told what to see. For me, this is what make The Name of the Wind so compelling. 
 In terms of characters, I loved the realistic portrayal of love. Typically it doesn't happen overnight, and sometimes it ends in heartbreak. I was so relived that there wasn't any superficial ""instalove,"" which seems to be the new favorite trope of YA fantasy. Instead, Rothfuss added emotion to his portrayal of love, which by definition makes any relationship imperfect. 
 I could go on and on about how much I liked this book. However, I have a dilemma. Should I rush into the second book knowing that the third book isn't coming anytime soon, or do I deprive myself of the second book until there is a release date of the third book? Either way, I will immediately be re-reading The Name of the Wind.""",2015-11-23 07:10:27,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)","fantasy,paranormal,fiction,young-adult,romance"

288,16076395,5,"""The author was kind enough to give me a copy of her book in exchange for an honest review. 
 Once Upon a Road Trip is based on a true story of the author's 2 month long road trip. It's a trip that a lot of people think of having, but never end up doing. She stays with people she met off the internet. But not to worry, she had defense training, mace, and a knife, so she was fully prepared for anything that might come her way. But then there was Canada...oh Canada. She could've gone to jail for carrying mace but holding a knife is perfectly fine. Craziness. 
 Faith, hope and love are common themes in Angela Blount's debut novel, Once Upon a Road Trip. While faith may be a turn-off for some readers, it's refreshing for those that have faith in their lives, such as myself. Reading it, I felt myself wish that I was as strong of a person as Angie is. She has her boundaries and convictions that she does well in keeping throughout the novel. She incorporated Christ in her life by always asking for guidance and showing love to those around her, and she grew throughout the novel. 
 I loved the story and while it may have taken a little bit of time to really get into it, I found myself hooked. I absolutely loved the love story! Especially since it is a true happy ending. It's the story of true love and how she met her children's father. I also loved how clean it was! So many young adult stories have sex involved, and it's refreshing to see a character that wants to wait until marriage. 
 I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read an inspirational read about a girl with faith that takes the trip of a lifetime. I look forward to reading more books from her.""",2013-10-12 09:38:49,"Once Upon a Road Trip (Once Upon a Road Trip, #1)","young-adult,romance,non-fiction,fiction,history,historical fiction,biography"
289,17730406,4,"""We were introduced to Ghost and Natalie in Friend-Zoned. I was beyond excited reading Friend-Zoned because I feel love with every single character! 
 But Ghost? 
 See I just knew his story would be a good one and I was really hoping we would get his next! And what a story it was. 
 Belle Aurora wrote Love Thy Neighbour in the same way she wrote Friend-Zoned and I loved every single word of it. She's got a great writing voice and her characters feel like they can just walk off the page and into your life seamlessly. In Friend-Zoned we were introduced to this group of men and women who come together by chance because of the budding relationship between Nik and Tina. I really loved those two and I was so happy to see more of them in Love Thy Neighbour. I didn't really have someone in mind when I thought of Tina however, I always picture Maksim Chmerkovskiy as Nik. 
 But I digress...this is about Ghost and Natalie! 
 ""This girl. She's my girl. She's not perfect. Neither am I. But she's perfect for me, and I'll do anything I can to keep her."" 
 Ghost is one of those guys with impenetrable armor. He has a past that no one should ever have and those demons keep him locked up like Ft. Knox. In comes Natalie and she's a force to be reckoned with. She's beautiful, funny, and very strong willed. 
 Together they are perfect. 
 As it is in life, nothing is ever easy. There are several obstacles these two must over come. With every situation you'll find yourself smiling. You'll even laugh out loud a few times. And the sex....holy cow is this book hot!!! My Kindle screen steamed up several times! 
 Ghost aka Asher is still probably my favorite of all the characters. There's just something about him that makes you want to love him. 
 The story could have been much deeper with lots more angst but that would have taken the light, fun tone of Belle Aurora's books. In my opinion these are stories to be enjoyed and not necessarily critiqued at every turn. They are serious but fun. 
 ""Tina leans forward and asks quietly, 'Do you? You know? Love her?' 
 Squeezing Nat's knee again, I reply, 'She's teachin' me how.""

290,17325147,5,"""This book took me by surprise. At first I thought it was going to be good. I knew it would probably be sad. I guessed I would probably cry. What I didn't count on was my emotional attachment to every character. I didn't know that I would become so invested in this story that I would have to walk away from it to collect myself. I didn't realize how close to home certain aspects of this book would hit. I also didn't count on loving it so much. There were times when I couldn't breathe. I literally sat there holding my breath. It was that overwhelming. That haunting. That beautiful. This is a story about healing, forgiveness, love, and for pushing yourself towards LIFE every single day. 
 ""This book is for everyone who has survived. You are not broken. You can love and be loved, despite what may feel like the eternally brutal nature of the world. Even when you're drowning and so far under, there is always time to reach for someone who will teach you how to breathe again."" 
 Blythe is struggling to survive. Her parents are gone. Her brother in another state. It's her last year at college and she's just barely making it through her last year of college. Then Sabin barrels into her life. This chance encounter throws her off course and she makes a decision right then and there. 
 ""Today I will be able to say that I did something unexpected."" 
 This is how she ends up meeting Chris. What a beautiful soul this man has. He's been through something that no one should ever have to endure and yet he's surprising well adjusted. However, the pain felt by both Blythe and Chris is palpable. Together they know they make sense and apart they are broken. They can heal each other...maybe... 
 ""At least one thing is certain: Chris and I are inextricably connected. Do I have factual reasons to know this? Proof? Assurances? No None. 
 Some people believe in God; I believe in Chris."" 
 What I really loved about this book was the slow build. Yes there was an instant connection between the two but no they didn't just fall instantly in love or in bed. The relationship took time to build. It felt real to me. If you come from a past that involves any sort of loss/dysfunction/abuse whatever, then you know that relationships are not easy. Sometimes they don't happen at all. Breaking down those walls and working through your demons is not an easy thing. Letting someone love you when you don't love yourself is even harder. 
 ""I thought he was just like me."" 
 ""I thought we would find our way into a love with no return."" 
 ""I thought we were an absolute."" 
 Chris helps Blythe to breathe again. He shows her how to live through the pain, to accept it, to own it, but to not let it consume you. But for Chris it's not that easy. His pain is much different. He's just not ready to move on. 
 ""You are the great love of my life that I'm never going to have."" 
 I haven't even begun to talk about the other characters. Normally, I might mention one or two because they're funny or add something great to a book. This is by far the first book I've ever read where I loved every single side character. I hate to even call them side characters. I know Blythe and Chris are considered the main but this group boy they are so integral to the story. I know this book wouldn't have been the same without each and every one of them. 
 Chris's siblings are Sabin, Estelle, and Eric. Sabin might just be my favorite of the bunch. He's charismatic and boisterous and funny. He's also battling his own demons. He's there for Blythe in a way that no one else is. She depends on him and he her. They anchor each other. Then you have Estelle who is strong and fiercely independent. She's beautiful and she's also the only who believes in God. Her faith is what helps her to cope yet she too is broken. Eric is Estelle's twin brother. He's shy, sweet, and quiet yet also strong. Zach is Eric's boyfriend and you know they are good for each other but Eric too is broken. James is Blythe's younger brother. He goes to another school and their relationship is complicated. There is a lot of blame and guilt plaguing them because of the circumstances surrounding their parent's death. Seeing what happens between the two was very special for me. 
 Each of these characters have a profound affect on this story. You may only find one that touches you, maybe all of them will, but I know you will connect to one of them. 
 ""You said something last night that was completely wrong. I could never touch anyone the way that I touch you. And I will never forget falling in love with you. Don't forget that."" 
 ""And this is how we say good-bye."" 
 The story will grab your heart and squeeze and squeeze until you think you can't take anymore. It's like this until the very last sentence. You will fall in love. You will want a happy ending for all of them. 
 Left Drowning has everything you could ever want in a book. It's one of the best books I've read this year. Definitely in my top 10 from the last 2 years.

294,16076395,2,"""I received a copy of this from the author in exchange for an honest review. (And I apologize for the lateness--no excuses at all, 100% my fault.) 
 A memoir is a bit different than the usual novel because by insulting the characters, you are indirectly insulting actually people. Strange events can't be deemed as unrealistic because they actually happened, and thoughts that characters have can't be said to be too erratic or contrasting because they were the person's real thoughts. If I insult any of the people who were included and renamed in this story, I apologize. 
 To make it simple, the lasting impression I got from the story was that it made me very angry. The main character, Angeli, was almost raped in this book. I know this book was most likely based on true events the author experienced, so by insulting this I might be insulting the author herself. I'm sorry, that is not my intention. I'm angry because after this event occurred, Angeli did nothing. She knew the possibilities, including that her attacker might even do it to someone else one day, yet did nothing. Being raped, or almost being raped, is never the victim's fault. I'm so sorry that this happened, and I understand how frightening it must have been, but the victim should never be blamed, no matter if s/he is passed out drunk, naked, or in a room with some potential predator. Never. I understand this is most likely what the author did in the actual situation, so she can't change the events, but either way it really infuriates me.  
 To be honest, I feel like the biggest reason I gave this two stars was the ending. The events after this really didn't seem to resolve anything, nor did Angeli receive any worthy consolation, in my opinion. After such a traumatic incident (explained in spoiler), the ending seemed very quick and rushed. 
 I mostly enjoyed the author's style of writing. By switching from third person to short excerpts from the diary Angeli kept throughout her trip, I was able to somewhat understand Angeli's thoughts. Though inconsistent and crazy, they represented that real people have complex minds, not simple 2D ideas that can be tweaked for novel purposes. 
 The characters were also depicted pretty well. I feel like I reacted to every character the way that I should have. The character Scott was a roller coaster of emotions for me, because though I never liked him to begin with, I did start to warm up to him until he proved himself to be a complete and utter fuckface. Three of my favorites included Zak, the boy Angeli stayed with in Canada, and Grady and Vincent, two guys from the south, one of them that eventually became Angeli's love interest. The only character I really had problems with (that I shouldn't have had any with) was Angeli. In the beginning she seemed to regard people in an almost arrogant way, and talked a lot about her ""inner feminine side being repressed"" as well as not wanting to be a stereotype, which apparently is something she cared a lot about throughout the whole book (after her traumatic incident, the fact that she had become a stereotype was one of the first thoughts that sprang to mind.) 
 I normally don't like it when authors include too much religion in a book, so I didn't really appreciate Angeli's thoughts on God. I don't mind if people are religious, but Angeli voiced her thoughts so freely it seemed like disagreeing couldn't be an option unless you were a horrible person, as the only people who doubted God were the fuckhead character i mentioned above, a depressed character who seemed to have no faith in anything (though I did like Kalvin), and a cheating ex-gf. I enjoyed the religious questioning between Vincent and Angeli because Angeli explained why she believed in what she did, showing she was not blindly accepting a faith but believing it because she truly believed she had a relationship with her God. 
 I liked that this was a memoir. It struck me as odd that all of these events actually occurred, but kept the novel refreshing and free of doubt for any one part. Though I wasn't too keen on everyone falling in love with Angeli and telling her they loved her after about two days, I had to remind myself these were actual events and not some sappy hogwash a writer wanted to write. Angeli and Vincent's romance was far from perfect, but I liked Vincent and if he and Angeli are a couple in a real life, then congratulations to both of you.""",2013-12-10 09:00:27,"Once Upon a Road Trip (Once Upon a Road Trip, #1)","young-adult,romance,non-fiction,fiction,history,historical fiction,biography"

300,186074,2,"""Nothing new here. Rothfuss is probably capable of writing a great fantasy novel someday, but this isn't it. There are plenty of ingredients from the Generic shelf, although I admit it's hard to write in this genre without that. 
 When the hero can do anything after ten minutes' study, and can always get out of trouble even without the ten minutes, where's the suspense? Kvothe is a Mary Sue, and this is pulp fiction from the ""mighty thews"" era. 
 The Ambrose/Hemme thread is way, way too much like Malfoy/Snape. 
 The women are just plain unbelievable. 
 The drooling, worshipful friends are hard to swallow, too.

301,32620360,4,"""Wish You Were Here is the first contemporary novel of Renee Carlino's that I have read. I previously read her paranormal romance, Lucian Divine, which I did enjoy, but I have never read any of her strictly contemporary novels. I knew nothing about Wish You Were Here before I started reading it and I am glad I did not. Wish You Were Here was a quick, engaging, and emotional read that I enjoyed. I would recommend reading Wish You Were Here if you are interested in reading a quick New Adult contemporary novel that has the potential to make you cry. 
 My favorite part of Wish You Were Here was the fact that part of the story was based in San Diego, California. I fell in love with San Diego the first time I visited the city for San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) in 2014 and I loved being there in the story. I especially loved that the convention center, where SDCC is annually held, was briefly mentioned. I was unable to attend SDCC this year or visit San Diego, but I am glad that I was able to journey there in Wish You Were Here. I wish I was there in San Diego. 
 Although the ability to predict the storyline of Wish You Were Here was rather easy, I appreciated the path the story took. Wish You Were Here is essentially a book about life. While it also features love, loss, moving-on, and recovery, the true purpose is to celebrate life. Not many books I have read feature the theme of life when under these particular circumstances. 
 The characters of Wish You Were Here were, by no means my favorite characters of all-time, but I fell in love with them and their story. While I do not agree with all the main character's choices and I do condemn some of them, it was interesting to follow her on this journey. Laura's Mvula's Show Me Love is a great anthem for her journey and story arc. The romance in Wish You Were Here was nice, but it was cheesy, at times. 
 Wish You Were Here was an enjoyable read and I am interested to read Renee Carlino's other contemporary books, I currently own Sweet Thing and After the Rain.

308,19057,4,"""I was inspired by the main character Ed's very normal life. Maybe normal is too nice a word. His life is more mediocre. He doesn't have any ambitions or achievements or direction really. The story is about him receiving anonymous cards in the mail that challenge him to help people. He changes their lives in small and big ways just by being observant. It made me want to observe and serve others more. If an ordinary guy can help in small ways, then so can I. 
 After reading I Am The Messenger, I got that chance. 
 I saw a guy shopping for baby formula at the grocery store. He would look at a can of baby formula for a minute and put it back. Then he'd look at another can. Then he'd put it back. I found this strange and fascinating. Most people quickly dump 8 cans of the exact same formula in their shopping cart and hurry off. I have never seen someone compare types of baby formula so carefully. 
 This guy was taking his time for some reason. I continued to watch him (he didn't notice because he was now scrutinizing a fifth can of formula) and tried to figure out what situtation would make someone shop for formula like that. He must never have bought it before. Maybe he has a wife at home with a screaming newborn baby and was instructed to ""get formula"" only to find the grocery store has 473829 kinds. And now he doesn't know what kind to get. So I went up to him and helped explain the difference between the 439280 kinds of formula and gave him a coupon. He seemed grateful. I imagined him going home to his wife victorious because he'd gotten the right formula AND used a coupon. 
 It's not life changing or anything. That being said, Ed didn't feel like he was doing anything life changing either. 
 It's not a big thing, but I guess it's true-- big things are often just small things that are noticed. 
 -Markus Zusak, I Am the Messenger (p. 221). 
 But it reminded me that kindness, true kindness, comes from listening and observing others to see what they really need. Small acts of kindness are big in their own way. 
 The reason this story works is because it's crude, crass, biting, sarcastic, and full of swearing. Let me explain. The writing hides the preachiness of the story so well that I really enjoyed reading it and it wasn't until the end that I realized I learned something. I'm not saying something has to be crude for you to learn something. But hiding a story about serving others in a crude story might accidentally teach someone something when all they had really intended was to pick up an entertaining book. Making it a little crude can also make the story relatable so you close the book feeling like the character did things that you are more than capable of doing, too. 
 There were some parts of the writing that I found so beautiful. Here's one of my favorite quotes. I just love how Markus Zusak takes a cliche saying and switches the words around to paint a lovely picture: 
 Quietly, Marv cries. 
 His hands appear to be dripping on the wheel. The tears grip his face. They hold on and slide reluctantly for his throat. 
 -Markus Zusak, I Am the Messenger (p. 316). 
 I like that the tears grip his face instead of his hands gripping the wheel. But I can still imagine the image of tears gripping his face like he's trying so hard not to cry but he can't help it. I find it so beautiful for some reason. 
 The twist at the end did confuse me. [spoiler]Who is the messenger? My book club helped me figure it out. The character is the message about serving others and the author is the messenger because he made up the story. Right??[/spoiler] 
 Ed's friend has a crappy car and he keeps calling it a Falcon. I've never heard of that kind of car so I couldn't get this image out of my head:

 Words cannot even express the amount of joy it brings me when I am the first of my friends to read something. Well, when it's something I liked - being the one to burst the bubble when a highly anticipated release turns out to be a turd kinda sucks. Anywho, when I saw this blurb . . . . 
 ""Scream meets YA"" 
 I had much excite! But then I saw the next part . . . . 
 "" in this hotly-anticipated new novel from the bestselling author of Anna and the French Kiss"" 
 Oh noes. My experience with Anna was mucho baddo : ( 
 There's Someone Inside Your House is Exhibit A of why you shouldn't just throw the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to giving an author a second chance. This was everything I wanted it to be. Much like with One Of Us Is Lying earlier this year, the comparison to its ""inspired by"" or counterpart or whatever you want to call it was spot on. The only difference??? 
 They say there are no more original ideas. And maybe that's true. (Except what Shelby just read about eating baby teeth - that seems pretty friggin' original.) There's Someone Inside Your House proves that an idea doesn't have to be original for it to be a crapload of fun. This one follows the slasher formula pretty well. There's a super baddy who just wants to . . . . 
 Well, maybe he wants to stab the shit out of you and mash your brains, but you get the idea. 
 There are oversexed teens who say things like ""I'll be right back"" and other stuff that shows they didn't take the sage advice of this fella . . . . 
 There's even a little humor when everyone should be in panic mode . . . 
 ""Shit! What's your password?"" 
 ""9999."" 
 ""What? Why would you do that? Somebody could guess that!"" 
 ""You didn't."" 
 Bonus was you weren't forced to spin your wheels for forever and a day before you found out who the killer was.

 ""I thought at least you could give me this, you could at least do that, but the truth is that you give me nothing."" 
 Welcome to my favorite week of the year! Unfortunately, real life kind of got in the way and I failed to realize Banned Book Week was quickly approaching until I received the pop-up reminder on my calendar this morning. It just so happens that by some strange coincidence I had finished My Absolute Darling last week and (of course) had not yet written anything down. While not yet a ""banned"" or ""challenged"" book, I figure it will only be a matter of time before this selection becomes one due to its disturbing subject matter and the fact that since it is about a 14 year old girl, there's a good chance young people will want to read it. 
 What you have here is a coming of age story about a girl who named Turtle (actual name Julia). Turtle is a girl who lives up to her moniker - attempting at all costs to stay inside the safety of her own shell to protect her family secret from getting out. And I'm going to go ahead and spoil this because readers really need to know what they're getting into here before they decide to add this to their TBR: Turtle's father is not only emotionally and physically abusive throughout the story, but their relationship is also incestous. 
 I picked this up because of my friend Jennifer's glowing review. Sadly, I didn't have a 5 Star reading experience like she did. I appreciate what the author tried to do, but there were some things that pulled me out of the story - and when you're reading something that should feel like getting hit in the face with a frying pan for the duration, being pulled away leaves you with a feeling almost like vertigo (which may be beneficial to many readers *shrug*). 
 So what went wrong for me? Well, to begin with, this needed a heavier-handed editor. As I said before, it didn't always flow for me. My initial thought was it must have been translated to English due to the excessive use of adjectives and detailed descriptions of the local flora and fauna (and at times, Turtle's ""engorged"" bits *eww and also not really an accurate descriptor*), while the actual story itself (which should have been graphically brutal if it followed the author's pattern of writing) was lacking. Not to mention all the G.D. gun talk. If someone needs to be punched in the face like this one did with the foreshadowing, then they probably should stick to easy-readers. The choice of third person narration with everything being only from Turtle's perspective was off-putting as well. I think this would have been much more powerful if written in first person. The way it was I had tons of questions I wanted answers to that could have been provided (and I'm usually one who is okay with not knowing every detail). But I wanted to know more about what made Martin a monster. Was his upbringing truly terrible? Did he repeat the sins of his father? Was he simply a bullshit artist? I wanted to be in his brain. First person would have made that impossible and I wouldn't be griping about it. I also assume Martin murdered Turtle's mother, but that was an open-ended matter as well. I'll leave it that I'm dubious she died while ""abalone diving."" While I do love the ""John Green"" type of teenager, Jacob and Brett were just a little too cool for school in my opinion. And then there was the little something extra (no spoilsies). This story didn't need a kitchen sink thrown in FFS. Not to mention the over-the-top climax and tidy little ending wrapped up in a bow. Some stories don't need to end well. This was one of them. As twisted as it is, if this was a YA book it would get more stars from me. I enjoy authors who are willing to push the envelope. As it was, this amounts to a decent debut. I'll be interested to see what Gabriel Tallent comes up with next.""",2017-09-19 18:01:42,My Absolute Darling,"fiction,young-adult,mystery,thriller,crime"

 In order to prove that NO, I DON'T ONLY READ PORNOS THANK YOU VERY LITTLE I begged Steve to pull me out of my downward spiral and buddy read this one with me. When my husband asked his nightly question ""what are you reading????"" I was so very proud to say a classic rather than smut. I also jumped at the chance to say it was a book written by the author of The Talented Mr. Ripley and that this novel became one of my favorite Hitchcock films. It was at this point my husband pointed out that in the course of our 20 year marriage there has been an annual Alfred Hitchcock movie marathon on Turner Classic Movies and that he was pretty sure the winner of first place in my heart was . . . . 
 He also pointed out during said movie marathons that no interaction with me was permitted during . . . . 
 And . . . . 
 And . . . . 
 And . . . . 
 And . . . 
 Either. So basically me saying ""a favorite Hitchcockian masterpiece"" pretty much amounted to diddly shit. 
 It was at this point I reminded him exactly what this story was about . . . . 
 Guy Haines meets Charlie Bruno on a train and shares a meal with him in order to pass the time. I know what you're thinking - WHY THE EFF WOULD ANYONE DO THIS WHEN THEY COULD JUST READ A BOOK?!?!?!? Who knows? It was a different time when men wore hats and ladies had to worry about stuff like whether the seam on their stockings was straight. Basically, people were cray. Anywho, over the course of this dinner between strangers (*shudder*) Guy shares that he's an architect sitting on the cusp of making it big, has a real beaut of a gal he's planning on marrying and that the reason he's on the trip is to finalize a divorce agreement with his first wife. Bruno's story is pretty much that he's a drunk with an Oedipus complex who would like someone to off his dear ol' dad. Which leads us to the offer of a murder swap and Bruno mistaking a clearly stated no for YAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS leading to turnabout being fair play and Guy getting blackmailed into fulfilling his half of the bargain as well. 
 Sounds like a real winner, don't it??? Yeah. It definitely could have been if it were about 100 pages lighter. There just wasn't much to this one aside from the stabby stabby (or in this case the strangley shooty). The majority of the book was just ""meh"" page filler with little character development aside from each respectively losing their marbles. 
 The Hitchcock film, on the other hand? Magnificent. Please remember, however, that this is the man who could sniff out something so brilliant in an itsy-bitsy little 14-pager.

 To be honest, I don't really know what to say. Geek Love has been on my TBR since 2012. I'm fairly certain I even checked it out from the library at one point and returned it without reading. When Ron 2.0 was trying to bait all us creeps with his Last Days updates someone mentioned Geek Love and since I'm an asshole I went with that one rather than Ron's choice. 
 Enough with the backstory, right? You probably want to know about the book. Well, it goes a little something like this . . . . . 
 ""Tell about the time when Mama was the geek!"" 
 Y'all know what a geek is, right? 
 Well, yeah, but this one isn't about the kind of geek McDreamy was before he got dreamy. It's about this kind . . . . 
 That was Mama Lil. Lil had big dreams of being a trapeze girl, but an unfortunate accident proved that wasn't meant to be. Lil became the geek instead, catching the eye of Papa Al. With the help of some choice dope, a few insecticides and a handful of radioisotopes the two Binewskis created a very unique family . . . . 
 Geek Love is the story of family, of sibling rivalry, of sacrifice, of religion and a need for fame and glory. It definitely reminds us all to . . . 
 And featured a character that, even though it's the first week of the new year, I will remember forever. Oh little Boychick . . . .

Rex Stout spent more time developing the character of Wolfe's assistant, Archie Goodwin, so it's hard to form much of an opinion of Wolfe, except that he's eccentric (as are the other two detectives I mentioned). Apparently Wolfe is also extremely overweight, loves his beer, and grows exotic orchids. He also never (or rarely) leaves his house, hence the needs for the youthful and exuberant Archie (who makes good use of the roadster).

 This was my first foray into the audio book world, and man, was it good. Narrated by Trevor Noah himself, he takes you into an incredible journey back in time during South Africa's apartheid. The different dialects, accents, languages, voices and inflections he uses during his narration are a thing of wonder and beauty. He transports you into his world, he makes you feel everything, and you will find yourself laughing, shaking your head in incredulity and weeping tears of pain and heartbreak - and in no particular order. 
 I never thought of myself as a huge fan of Trevor Noah. I never watched his stand up comedy, and only watched a handful of episodes since he took over from Jon Stewart. I thought he was intelligent and entertaining, but no Jon Stewart. I picked up this book after hearing about it from my sister, who couldn't stop praising it. When I did purchase it, she insisted I listen to the audio book, promising me that it was a 100 times better when you listen to it because you get to truly experience his world and his childhood. So I did. 
 Trevor Noah became my friend during my long commutes to and from work. I was engrossed in his life, and fell in love with his mother, who is my hero in so many ways now. 
 Trevor Noah has a knack at explaining things to you in uncomplicated terms so you leave knowing more than you ever have about pre- and post- Apartheid in South Africa and about the complex system that divided people (white, black and colored), and about the communities he grew up in. He allows you to listen to his story and come to your conclusions, make your own judgments, and root for whomever you chose to root for. I always rooted for his mother, and for him. 
 I admit that I enjoyed his early years a lot more than the later ones. I thoroughly enjoyed his interactions with his mother as a child, their conversations, their arguments and their love for each other was a joy to listen to. Being a mother to a naughty boy myself, I found myself relating to his mother in many ways and laughing out loud at how his naughtiness was dealt with. I loved their conversations about Jesus, and you could immediately tell that Noah was quite a clever boy from very early on. The letters they wrote each other when they were fighting about something were simultaneously hilarious and endearing. I cannot begin to tell you how much I loved this book. 
 The last few chapters, when he gets into the business of hustling, were interesting, but I felt it went on for a little too long. It also seemed slightly abrupt how he went from hustling and DJ'ing to comedy. There was never any explanation on how he got into comedy, why he chose that path, or how he started. I would have liked to know more about that part of his life, because we know that when he gets the call from his brother Andrew at the end, he's already doing stand-up, but we don't know when or how it began. 
 The end tore me to pieces. The pain and heartbreak in his voice made my heart twist and squeeze itself and my eyes flood with unshed tears. 
 A beautiful story, told by a wonderful human being. I have a lot of respect for someone who has been through so much pain and struggle to come out a successful and humble person, and to be able to look back at his life and see it from a comedic perspective.""",2017-07-15 10:31:35,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,"non-fiction,history,historical fiction,biography,comics,graphic"

The story is told by an older Kvothe himself, to a Chronicle that traveled far and wide to find him. Even if some of the plot elements (e.g. a gifted young kid finding his way to a school of magic) may seem similar to the Harry Potter saga, this book could not be more different. The life of Kvothe is harsh, and here the focus is given to the struggle to survive under adversities, as a homeless youth or a penniless student. There are only two small issues with the book. First the main story is weak and as a result the plot feels episodic. Second, I feel like the stage is not set properly for some of the events.

 I don't normally read erotica, and I wouldn't normally go anywhere near a shapeshifting erotica because that stinks of bestiality to me more often than not (although I'm not totally against the idea of animal form smexitimes), so it is highly irregular that I'd not only be interested in an erotic novella, and one about dragon shifters to boot. 
 However Dead Sexy Dragon had an interesting blurb that drew me in: 
 ""The last thing dragon shifter Stig Wyvern needs is his dead friend's kid sister showing up on his doorstep, especially since he's just minutes away from entering a mating phase. Sharing his isolated house with the young woman he's desperately lusted after for quite some time is a recipe for disaster. 
 But Cora Cardenas has nowhere else to go. She's in deep trouble with some really nasty people and Stig is the only one who can protect her. That he's deliciously sexy and makes her tingle with the simplest of smiles is an added bonus. 
 Cora quickly realizes Stig is hiding something from her. To make matters worse, she's plagued with breathtakingly naughty dreams starring a shadowed lover who bears a startling resemblance to her host. And what the hell is going on in the basement at night? 
 Stig needs to get Cora out of his house but his inner beast has other ideas. He's found his mate and she's not going anywhere."" 
 And then at the end it said: 
 Word count: 25,000 words. 
 BAM! I'm in. A novella-length story means I won't be investing too much time if I end up not enjoying it. 
 So the story is about this guy 
 And this girl called Cora who has a very underdeveloped character but a solid backstory/reason for why she knocks on Stig's door despite having a key and an open invitation. 
 The story is mostly about their sexitimes, which was OK, I guess, as far as sexitimes go. I don't normally read erotica, and my only other experience has been 50 Shades of Grey where I only lasted 4% before throwing my Kindle down in disgust. Some of it was a bit stupid, such as Stig whispering in Cora's ear as she sucks him off, and that made me think he had some secret life as a contortionist no one bothered to tell me about. Some of it was repetitive and stupid. Cora often referred to her vagina as 'her sex', which I thought was stupid, but hey, for my first erotica I don't know any better. 
 Overall the romance was unconvincing but the sex was not. Whilst the characters were underdeveloped they did change by the end of the story (and therefore are three dimensional). I think I like the idea of 'in heat' mating phases, but not so much referring to sex as 'mating'. I'll need to read more in this series before I figure out if I like the dragon shifters being slaves to their sex hormones. In context it works, and it's all consensual. 
 What I did enjoy about this novella was that it had very solid worldbuilding, the two main characters were three dimensional, and the story actually had a plot besides sex. So I guess that's good. 
 But like I said, what do I know? Take any criticism with a grain of salt.

329,363391,4,"""Brought to you by The Moonlight Library! 
 The Yeerks appear to be infesting horses out at Zone 91, a poorly disguised parallel of Area 51 (which is in Nevada but we all know the Animorphs are in California!). What are the Animorphs going to do about it? Why, morph horses, of course! 
 This is one of the better books in the Applegate-written section of the series purely for its comedic value. We don't expect Cassie to be the funny one, but she's run over by a tank as a cockroach and then runs in a thoroughbred race. There are plenty of funny moments in this book as Cassie's naivety comes to the fore - she gives a fake name as ""Cindy Crawford"" and a fake phone number of ""12345678''. Also, Rachel buys her a new outfit, which actually makes other boys notice her, and makes Marco go slightly insane (but did we ever expect anything else?) 
 This is the first book after Tobias has been given his morphing power back, and it demonstrates how awkward it must be for a hawk to go to human places to acquire animals (a racetrack for the horses). Tobias also grumbles a lot about how poor the morphs are in comparison to his own body, or grumbles about being left out. 
 The Yeerks want to know if the rumoured alien technology held at Zone 91 is a threat to them or their invasion, and although they never actually find out what it is, Ax knows and informs the Animorphs. The Yeerks are still desperate enough to attack humans in broad daylight (well, night time, but in a public place) to force an infestation, and Cassie is the one to come up with a plan and foil them. Don't underestimate her. She may be a tree hugger but she's also one of the most ruthless Animorphs. It's dangerous, because she'll look all innocent with her big wide eyes until you realise you've lost a major battle in the war and have to retreat. 
 Cassie is a badass and should not be underestimated.""",2013-03-23 21:28:01,"The Unknown (Animorphs, #14)","fiction,young-adult,fantasy,paranormal,children,mystery,thriller,crime"

 A prototype Bug fighter crashes into a local supermarket, and the Animorphs decide to steal it and land it on the lawns of the White House. But after a brief tussle with Visser Three's Blade ship, the Animorphs find themselves flung half a day into the past, and trapped in South America. Meanwhile, Jake has been having flashforwards about the jungle, and flashbacks about his normal day. What the heck is going on? 
 Ladies and gentlefucks, allow me to introduce you to a concept we will visit again, so listen up: the Sario Rip. It is a hole in space time. A massive energy explosion caused it, and sent the Animorphs not only back in time but to South America, in the middle of the rainforest, in nothing but their morphing outfits and bare shoes. Fun fun. They have until the time the explosion happened in the first place to re-create the explosion, or else the anomaly, the impossibility to having two of the same people existing in a normal space time continuum, will cause each of the doubles to annihilate themselves. 
 Got it? 
 This novel is actually about what happens when Jake screws up. He doesn't often screw up, but in this case, he does screw up, and he screws up big. Sometimes I wonder if it's fair that the very few times he does monumentally screw up in the series, he's given the chance to undo it all. But I digress. Yes, Jake is the leader. Yes, he gets some good ideas. But ultimately, the Animorphs lose this alternate-universe battle, and that's why Jake's been having flash-forwards-and-backs, and why reality snaps back together to give him the chance to never do any of it. 
 The Animorphs suffer in the rainforest. Applegate does a brilliant job of showing us just how harsh the environment can be. Monster bugs. A million birds. Piranhas. Monkeys. Jaguars. Add in Visser Three, who can morph anything, and a bunch of tireless Hork-Bajir and Taxxons who seem strangely at home in the land of giant insects, and you're pretty much screwed. Unless you, too, can morph anything you touch. And just in time, the Animorphs manage to acquire a jaguar rather conveniently and also learn to appreciate the jungle from a predator's perspective. They have their usual Visser Three fight, where the Visser spends more time taunting than anything else while the Animorphs remain stoically silent, and in the end, Jake kills the Visser using a poisoned spear from a friendly Amazon tribesman. 
 Except that (spoiler) Jake dies, too. So reality snaps back together and Jake changes his mind about going after the bug fighter. It never happens. Except that at the start of the book, Jake gives us the usual, ""This is really happening and everything is true"" spiel, and it never actually happened. 
 So OK. No monkey morphs, no jaguars. No dead Visser Three. Equally, no dead Jake. And a story that never happened, and that no one but Jake remembers. This, ladies and gentlefucks, is what we call a filler novel, and it is the first instance that you can really skip over without missing anything at all. The concept of the Sario rip will be re-explained when it's re-introduced. But overall, it's still an entertaining novel and Applegate's descriptions of the rainforest and her torturing of her characters are well worth the read, even if she does in the end helicopter author them all to safety.""",2013-02-28 18:38:23,"The Forgotten (Animorphs, #11)","fiction,young-adult,fantasy,paranormal,children,mystery,thriller,crime"
331,19057,5,"""I picked this book up because of how freaking amazing Markus Zusak's The Book Thief was. So I went in to this book with high expectations and I was not at all disappointed. 
 Ed Kennedy is an underage cab driver who is stuck in a rut of his hopelessly, ordinary life. He's in love with his best friend, plays cards, and yearns for something to add any meaning to his life. That's when the first card arrives. Now Ed is sent across his small town looking into and trying to fix other peoples' broken lives. Throughout it all one question remains: Who is behind the cards? 
 I fell in love with how utterly unextraordinary Ed was in the beginning. He wasn't one of those guys who you'd think would never exist anywhere but in fiction. I could see Ed picking me up in his taxi. And as Ed went around and became a person with a different take on life, I fell in love with how broken he seemed in those moments. How humanely he took it all in. 
 My favorite story Ed learned was Marv's. His story made us understand him and I fell in love with him in the end too because of it.

 I thought it was pretty good overall. It ended with a really good finish, and the narrative voice that was bugging me early on in the book was greatly toned down during the last third of the book. (The first half or so of the book felt like I was watching a movie where the actors rarely spoke, instead it was mostly narrated from the authors POV. It was frustrating and pulled me out of the story repeatedly.) But the core story between H/h was the better part of this book, and for that I can see why many enjoyed this story. 
 The story centers around the struggles and troubles of a half-Indian man married to a white woman in the late 1800s, and opens with a heart wrenching scene that sets the tone for the rest of the book. You can't help but want Cord and Anne to find peace and happiness despite the obvious struggles they will face. The author does a great job of developing these two and making the reader believe in their relationship, I just wish she would have done the same for the secondary characters. 
 Besides the heavy use of narrative voice to tell this story, the development of some of the secondary characters and their role in the story felt off in places. When it came to Cord and Anne's relationships with their family members, I never fully understood any of the relationships so I had trouble understanding many of their actions. His brothers didn't seem to walk their talk and support Cord or give him the benefit of the doubt when it was painstakingly obvious they would and should. And her family was portrayed so one dimensional it was hard to get a read on where she stood with them much of the time. She should hate them but didn't, yet when she did hate them it seemed for much less offenses. 
 Still, it really was an enjoyable book and I don't regret reading it. Anyone who loves western romances with some grit and a slow-but-steady pace should enjoy it.""",2010-12-30 08:42:29,"Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold (Eyes of Silver, Eyes of Gold, #1)","history,historical fiction,biography,romance,fiction"

 I truly appreciated the characters - they felt very realistic and the heroine isn't some Mary-Sure. The only weak link was possibly the werewolf hating group if only because they seemed so cliche villains, as well as the love triangle because that has been done to death a million times already. I did figure out the mystery long before the end of the book, but in no way did that dampen my enjoyment.

351,10806008,4,"""Originally reviewed on my blog, Books from Bleh to Basically Amazing. 
 So, I'm going to break one of my personal review rules/no-nos/pet peeves here for Peter Nimble and His Fantastic Eyes by Jonathan Auxier and I'm going to compare it to another book. (Gasp, I know... Also, insert appropriate apology here). The story itself is pretty unique and charming, but I was reminded from the very beginning of A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket. The stories are not anything alike, but the writing felt very similar to me. It's told in that same third party narrative where the narrator will interject at times with 'clarifications' and comments. And it also had that same impossibility of character (like the baby biting through steel in ASoUE). 
 And I don't like it. 
 I did not enjoy the SoUE. I read most of the books and finally gave up because the story just wasn't enough to get me over my dislike of the narration and other... things. But I will say that although the narration was, at times, quite jarring to me, overall, I actually really enjoyed this book. 
 Once I got past the beginning, where the infant is left to fend for itself by the town elders and survives, I found myself really drawn into the happenings of the story. But it was a struggle and initially, I was really disappointed in the story, because I need my fantasy to be believable and realistic, which means I need to believe in my characters. Once Peter has gotten past his unbelievable childhood, the story really picks up for me. I found that I really liked Peter and I wanted so badly for him to succeed. There was so much at stake for him, and he had so little happiness in his young life that I so wanted things to work well for him. 
 The story was quite charming, and again, once past the beginning, this unknown/unseen narrator really does keep his comments and opinions to a minimum, allowing me to get farther into the story. I loved watching Peter learn about his surroundings, learn about himself and realize that he can teach and help others. He worries that his past as a thief makes him unworthy and he often sometimes confidence in himself, which is not surprising considering he's spent the last several years being told he's practically worthless. But Peter is strong and he is made of greater things than he knows, and there is much he needs to do in order to complete the quest given him by the mysterious professor. 
 His traveling companion, Sir Tode was also a rather enjoyable character. The victim of a Hag's curse (one that I think you definitely need to discover on your own) Sir Tode is an unlikely companion, but is really willing to be there for Peter, to be his eyes and his friend. 
 I'm so glad that I stuck with this book, that I didn't allow myself to get too discouraged when I started the book. It's a beautifully charming story, even with the narration being what it is. Peter is strong and brave, and although not perfect (for reasons I won't specify to avoid spoilers) Peter's struggles with being blind are raw and real. Peter understands that his skills as a thief are only what they are because of his blindness. He can hear and smell better, and his fingers are far more sensitive. He recognizes this. He knows these things. But he still longs for the ability to see. But he also doesn't dwell on it. It's one of those things, it is what it is, and he makes the best of what he has. I love little Peter. 
 The fantastic eyes were also such an enjoyable part of the story. I wasn't sure going into it, but after reading, I can (fairly confidently) say that this is a stand alone story. I had originally thought that perhaps it would be a trilogy, with one book dedicated, primarily, to one set of eyes, but I am happy to say that this story stands alone. All three eyes are used (and umm, pretty brilliant, if I may say so!) and the story resolves itself completely, in that way of all middle grade (ok, most MG). 
 I think this is a charming and delightful book, and I think it's one that will be enjoyed by many, many people. If you are a fan of Lemony Snicket's writing style, I think you will just love this one. And if you are not, give it a try anyway. It just might surprise you. 
 Oh! Also- I loved the small illustrations that started each chapter.

 **Update** 
 As I've read over some of my past reviews, I've noticed that I have the tendency to include something along the lines of 'Still pretty good though' with most of the books that I didn't really enjoy reading as long as I didn't actually hate them... It's kind of a lie, and that bothers me. 
 So, I am now going to tell you how I really felt about this book: 
 In some ways I am grateful to this book. It's what clued me in to why I thought I didn't like SciFi and Fantasy for such a long time (but mostly SciFi) It's not that I don't like the genre. I've read several SciFi books that I very much enjoyed. What I don't like is being blindsided by it. If I am going to invest myself in something that dabbles in the realm of science fiction (or fantasy) I need to be prepared for it. Although knowing it was the 4th book in a series would have helped, the real reason I didn't enjoy this book was the random introduction of science fiction. The story begins with a young girl (15?) trying to come to terms with the fact that her beloved grandfather is dying while also trying to win/juggle the affection of 3 boys. One is in love with her, but she just thinks he's a friend, a self-destructive no-good who is always there and probably just wants to get super friendly... and the college student her brother is researching dolphins with whom she is totally crushing on, who in turn really likes her, but knows he shouldn't. So, already it's not really my kind of book. 
 Although I knew I probably wouldn't love it, I'd still be able to enjoy it for what it is. But... the dolphins. Halfway through the story, we realize that Vicky can communicate with dolphins. Telepathically. Oh, wait what?! This book, that was supposed to be just another coming of age story suddenly turns into something different. I feel that I would have enjoyed the story much more had I been warned that there was some SciFi going on. So, I'm warning you. It's there. Be prepared for it. 
 I might return to this book in a while to see if my experience with it will be different now that I know what it contains. Maybe I'll try reading more of the Austin family series. We'll see.

Or anything in this forsaken book. And the author does nothing besides blabbering alien terms in the hope I get amazed how much Kovte knows by how ignorant I am on the subject. I am not pleased.

 This is around where I stopped in my last reread a couple years ago, because this is the last physical Animorphs book currently sitting on my shelf (the rest are in another country, alas). And ahahaha this one is just RIDICULOUS and freakin' hilarious, and I love it -- this time, the Animorphs take on their universe's analogue for Area 51, and it's fantastic. Maybe not as good as the Futurama episode about it, but still good. Marco is a conspiracy nut, Cassie is absolutely godawful at improvising on the fly, and an all-out Yeerk battle unfurling in a theme park is hysterical -- as in, I laughed so hard at one of Visser Three's reactions that I was shaking uncontrollably with muffled laughter on the subway for about 5 minutes, because I kept rereading the same two lines over and over and descending into more gigglefits. The Visser is such an amazingly well-done villain because KAA somehow believably writes him as both utterly terrifying, AND hilarious. 
 The whole book itself, really, is on the lighter and comedic side compared to the heavier subject matter of the previous. The only thing that ground my gears was Cassie talking to the jockey while in horse morph, just to win a race. For all their secrecy about morphing, sometimes the kids are SO FUCKING DUMB about talking to humans. 
 EDIT: I just upped this rating by a star, because in talking to Caitlin about it even weeks later, I still fell into gigglefits thinking about Area 51 and the horses and the theme park. This book is just SO FUNNY.

364,14358,0,"""Battle is over for this book, at any rate. 
 Before anyone starts throwing stones or even worse missiles, I have to point out that this is not a review, but rather a response. Furthermore, I read this book at the wrong time. Which is NOT code for saying that it's an immature book you could only love if you read it as a child. But really, rather than desiring to avoid abuse, I hate to say why a book that is an abiding favourite for so many friends is one that really didn't work for me. 
 As a child myself, I read A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, and possibly one or two of L'Engle's others, but not many. The Crosswicks Journal books and Walking on Water I read as an adult and loved. These books spoke in a way that felt deeply authentic, and always seemed right, whether she was talking of love and loss, or imperfection and failure, or grace. When the later controversy arose over the extent to which she'd thrown her own family into her fiction without much concern for their feelings, I didn't really know the fiction that might have been involved, so was just confused and saddened to hear about literary and family conflict for a favourite author. 
 Another thing that had been floating in the back of my head for some years in an unresolved kind of way was what Connie Willis said about L'Engle. (Or at least, I very much hope she said it and I'm not misquoting her!) Even though Willis herself is a believer, she said that Madeleine L'Engle was a Christian apologist before she was a storyteller, and that sometimes that didn't work for a writer. Which just didn't quite make sense, especially after reading Walking on Water and the Crosswicks Journals. 
 Then came the Book Battle and reading A Ring of Endless Light, and those two disparate things fell into place in my head. Nothing about the book felt true or natural to me. I don't just mean that the family seemed too good to be true, with their musical evenings and extreme intellectual superiority. They did, but in an odd way, as if they were Madeleine L'Engle's idealised version of how she and hers were. It also made very clear to me why there might be a question of her family's being upset about appearing in her fiction. Vicky's behaviour, in her family and outside it, felt especially unnatural, and the more we were told that she was special, and a poet, the worst it got. (Seeing the poetry did not fix that.) The thing is, though, that it's often possible to put a problem like my one of finding the family to be unbelievable off to an analytical part of your mind, as long as the story is flowing around it smoothly. This one only flowed for me in a very few places. 
 I'm sure I'd have reacted to the returning characters differently if I'd read the earlier books in the series, so again, I'm acknowledging this is not the usual way to read them. As it was, though, I especially disliked the three-guys-chasing-Vicky plotline, a reaction which included not much liking any of the guys, or, to be honest, Vicky herself. It started to feel as if the author were going for the magic number three (I'll come back to that) and cherry-picking relationships a ""special"" girl like Vicky might encounter for purposes of education. Adam: the serious boy who'll blow hot and cold (except always hot for your usefulness to his scientific pursuits) as he's tugged between the opposing forces of respect (he's got YEARS of post-graduate study before he can MARRY and she's the kind of girl you would only MARRY), guilt (she's too young AND his friend's younger sister) and OMG SHE'S SO SPECIAL (the dolphins know it!!). Leo: a classic. The friend who wants more and you don't want to hurt because you're nice and you care about him but know you'll never be interested in that way, but can't you be friends?? And finally Zachary. Bad boy with the tortured soul extraordinaire. Sexy, sophisticated, handsome, charming (except when he absolutely isn't, but more on that shortly). In theory, it should have worked really well, having intelligent yet insecure (and never as popular with the boys as her younger sister, 'natch) Vicky seen as truly attractive and also showing the real distress each of these relationships could cause a caring and compassionate person. 
 It didn't come off that way for me, though, and the point at which it really hit me enough to throw me out of story-reading into a detached, what IS this? type of reading was after Zachary nearly hits an old woman crossing the road. Zach's already brought Vicky out twice, on wonderful outings, taking her to an exclusive country club (although that might be tautological!) with fancy food, a concert she loves, flying, which she also loves, and here's the significant third time. He picks her up and she has to yell at him to slow down or if he doesn't, to let her out of the car. He does, but then sees an old woman with a cane crossing the road. He says, ""She's no use to society. Shall I mow her down?"" and steps on the accelerator. ""He slammed on the brakes, but not before he'd given the old woman - and me - a good fright."" He then says that Vicky knew he wouldn't hit her, and she replies that with him she never knows, but that's the end of the incident's ramifications. She goes on with the day, enjoying the flying enormously, is taken to a fancy French menu (without even a menu, ""the ultimate in elegance""), is made to ""feel glamorous"", which she likes, and enjoys a ""long, slow kiss"" while being grateful Zach doesn't make anything more of it. This is a day spent with someone who started off by accelerating towards an old and not very mobile woman, making her fear he'll run her down. Just - WHAT??? It's so utterly inconceivable to me that anyone with any decency would scream at Zach to slow down or let her out when he's driving too fast on EMPTY roads, but not do the same when he's purposefully terrified an old woman. Especially as Vicky is presented as a character who's deeply moral if sometimes struggling to figure out what's right in some situations. 
 Suddenly, that number three came back to me. Three guys, the third day's outing with Zachary - and three temptations. I can't quite fit the three temptations of Christ in the desert to the three temptations Zachary offers Vicky, but three there are, nonetheless, and it feels much less fairy tale and more scriptural to me. First, he tempts her with luxuries - the good things money and privilege can offer. She enjoys them thoroughly, even though she has gained enough confidence in herself not to be pushed into drinking alcohol when she doesn't want to. Even Zach's too speedy driving (of an Alfa Romeo, no less) on an earlier trip both terrifies and ""exhilarates"" her. Second, he tempts her with the pleasures of the flesh, to use the old-fashioned term. He's gorgeous, sexy and she really enjoys kissing him, except when thoughts of Adam get in the way. Finally, and most interestingly, she's tempted by the desire to ""save him"". Her grandfather is the one who sees this in her most clearly - or possibly it's just that she trusts him to understand and not immediately judge Zachary - and his advice is characteristically gentle and wise. But, unfortunately, it's not until she feels that Zachary lets her down when she needs him that this desire to save him loses its power. 
 There were many other minor things that bothered me, though some irritated less than they might have because I just gave up and laughed. Of course you all sit around and read Shakespeare at night, and in your world Twelfth Night and The Tempest are as good for a 7-year-old as for the grandfather. I also got a bit of amusement out of thinking of the three guys as the three bears - Zachary too rich, Leo too poor, and Adam just right! (Not that Vicky ever thinks that Leo is too poor, of course, but there's more than a bit of classism in the book, and it's telling that when she hopes she can manage to always be friends with Leo it's because ""He was the kind of person, like his mother, who could always be counted on to be there when you needed him."") Mostly, as well as what I've said about the book not feeling natural, it was strange seeing so many events, discussions and even musical preferences that had been described in the Crosswicks Journals turning up again. I have no idea whether the non-fiction was a more a portrait of the person L'Engle wanted to be, and the family she wanted to have than of who she and they actually were, even if I had any desire to make such a judgment about it. Nor am I saying that my odd reading of A Ring of Endless Light as a structure of lessons, or almost homilies, wrapped around plot and characters that weren't strong enough to hold them together, is anything other than odd. All the same, when I started to write this up, I couldn't stop thinking about the ending of one of Connie Willis's books. (I'll put the title behind a spoiler cut.) Passage 
 . A cross is formed by the masts on the ship coming to rescue the protagonist from the most terrifying void of death. Even though it comes from the same place of belief for Willis and L'Engle, that was earned through story in a way that satisfied me as Vicky's rescue from an emotional void by the dolphins at the end of A Ring of Endless Light utterly failed to do.""",2015-02-15 11:42:40,"A Ring of Endless Light (Austin Family, #4)","young-adult,fiction,fantasy,paranormal,children,romance"

I liked this aspect of the book. The ending, however, had one too many twists for me - my eyes were definitely rolling at a few of them. 
 This is a standalone novel, which I appreciate (not every story needs to be a quadrilogy, and this definitely didn't need to be), but because this had to tell a complete story and establish the universe in 400 pages, the word-building was pretty shallow. The evil people are evil because that's the way they are, and the good people are good because they are, but there's not a lot of explanation behind it.

374,29780253,5,"""Wow. This book was amazing. 
 So, I don't read a lot of non-fiction or memoirs. It's just not what I normally gravitate toward. However, I've been wanting to dip my toes into more of these and I really like Trevor Noah. I've of course seen him on the Daily Show, and also several stand-up specials he's done where he speaks relatively openly about his upbringing. 
 This book expands on that in an incredibly candid way. We learn about the history of South Africa and the disgusting practice of institutionalized racism (Apartheid). We learn about how he was able to navigate this society where he never felt like he belonged because of the circumstance surrounding his birth. And we learn about his amazing relationship with his mother, a woman who is strict, stubborn, determined, loving, devout, and fierce in her convictions. 
 I loved the way he structured this book. It skips around to different time periods in his life, but it never feels choppy or confusing. There is a really steady pacing and the stories tie back into each other really nicely. 
 I also loved the tone of this book. There are some truly awful things described in this book. I can't even imagine what it must have been like to actually grow up like this. The fact that he is able to relate these stories in such a straightforward and candid manner while not coming off as dismissive or flippant is very compelling. The intense things are still intense. But for him, that was just the way it was, and the book's tone reflects that very well, in my opinion. 
 I really loved this book. I feel like I learned something and was also entertained...two of my favorite things about books.""",2017-05-18 14:30:30,Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,"non-fiction,history,historical fiction,biography,comics,graphic"

The book covers a lot of ground, from apartheid in South Africa - which made segregated USA look pretty good! - to self-esteem, to domestic abuse. Through it all, he even manages to make it funny here and there.

 This book was slightly better than the first. I still think the idea of the series is really cool, but I don't like how the authors use stereotypical teen language. In this book they let up on that a little bit, which made the book a better read. But, I don't like the direction the authors are using for Zoey. She is starting to be kinda bitchy towards her loyal friends. She snaps at them all the time. Which they do not deserve. I think she's starting to get the idea that since she has a bunch of nifty powers and is training to be a high priestess that she is the boss of their little group. When Stevie Rae died it seemed that she felt that it was everyone's job to look after her and help her move on. I understand that they wee BFFs and roommates, but the others had known Stevie Rae longer and were hurting too. I think she could have done a better job in comforting her friends. I also didn't like that she got involved with three guys so soon. I think the authors should have spaced out her love interests a bit more. I'm disappointed with how the authors are making Zoey.

 I won't kid you. The book takes a while to get going. Rothfuss has a detail-rich style of writing, very much in the style of Tolkien or even Frank Herbert. If you're looking for fast-paced action and a quick read, this isn't it. But there's a beauty in all the details that is worth the time spent to read this book. There's also the storytelling aspect that I really like. Rothfuss weaves an epic tale with classic themes and motifs. 
 The bulk of the book is in fact a tale, as told by Kvothe, a famous or possibly infamous hero now hiding in a tiny village as an innkeeper. The book doesn't even touch on how or why he's there, instead focusing on his childhood and first years at the university where he learned sympathy, this world's version of magic. There are secrets and things that are not what they appear, including demons that are fae, and a fire-breathing dragon which is really just more of a lizard. There's also an epic love tale and a coming of age. More, there are hints of things to come, including the elusive Chandrian who seek out and destroy any who even mention them, including Kvothe's parents and entire caravan. I like the idea that there's an unseen world hiding behind the world everyone knows, and Kvothe is uncovering it one secret at a time. 
 Dedicated fantasy readers will love this book. I wouldn't recommend it to those new to the genre. This is a five course meal, make no mistake. But I enjoyed every bite.""",2014-06-12 09:50:45,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)","fantasy,paranormal,fiction,young-adult,romance"
383,175243,4,"""Audiobook Review: 
 It took a bit of perseverance at the start. The intro salvo of this book is a long prologue worth a chapter and a half of mishmash of unrelated events which won't make sense until later on in the book. It didn't make real sense so I couldn't get into it despite having read Book 1 and knowing that this author has a compelling voice... slooow start kinda book.... 
 Being a visual reader, book covers play a significant role in my reading habit. I like the audio cover art as opposed to the paperback cover art. If I wasn't already a John Connolly fan, I would never buy the paperback. But even if I haven't read John Connolly yet, the audio cover art would have triggered my book buying radar. It's the mysticism with the gritty crime that draws me in. Just pure crime is not as much fun for me as the mystical crime that the audibook cover art implies. And the story telling quality IS compelling. To lure me into crime is not easy because I am a die-hard fantasy geek, so that tells you just how good the story telling quality must have been to make me a John Connolly fan. This book also reminded me why I am not a crime fiction fan though. I am a wuss, okey! I don't like gory killings. I am an escapist reader. I don't want to know about the state of the world or anything about the human nature. I want to escape reality. So gory murders is not the way to this reader's heart. And yes, this book is a gory crime fiction... But, if the story telling quality is masterful enough, I can be persuaded.... 
 This book also reminded me why I like angsty heroes. Yeah, they are fun with the right story teller. Charlie makes mistakes. Just like the rest of us. But he is not too stupid to live like Sookie Stackhouse. Just human enough for a reader to make a solid connection with. I would rate the character development a 5 out of 5. 
 At the end of it, I enjoyed this book despite it being a gory crime fiction and would definitely be reading the next Charlie Parker book.

386,13872,3,"""I was worried this book would be incredibly ableist, but (as someone who is not disabled), I didn't read anything that made me uncomfortable for that reason. Instead, the book chooses to focus on cultural opinions on beauty and how they provide (or remove) social power in different ways. Olympia, the narrator, is proud of her body precisely because it sets her apart from others and elevates her to a living, breathing art form. She is undeniably different. She's also acutely aware of people's reactions to her body and uses this to her full advantage in immensely clever ways. The central question is about the costs of assimilating in order to blend in, and the pros and cons of not having the choice to assimilate at all. 
 I'm glad this book exists and that it treats its subject matter and characters with such respect, but I was really let down by both climaxes. I found both to be boring and was confused by what was even happening. I never fully understood any characters' motives in creating the climaxes in the first place. They were just sort of... anticlimactic and obtuse as climaxes go.

 STORY 
 Because I listened to this audiobook, I wasted 7 hours of my life that I'll never get back! Listening to this book was a complete waste of my time! There was absolutely nothing unique or special about this book. The two main characters have deep feelings for each other yet for a prolonged period of time, numerous (often ridiculous) obstacles get in the way of them having a relationship. I can appreciate an angst-filled romance if the angst is believable but there wasn't anything solid about the drama in their storyline. Everything was extremely predictable and when we are led to believe that something catastrophic is about to happen, nothing does. It was extremely disappointing and I doubt I will ever read anything by this author again. 
 PERFORMANCE 
 Narrator Lauren Sweet isn't a horrible actress but her voice is so excessively nasally and whiny that it was often difficult to listen to. When she used exaggerated cheerleader-style voices while speaking for several female characters, I considered quitting the audiobook and buying the e-book instead yet was able to persevere. Not nearly as bad but just as annoying was how she mispronounced words such as Ibuprofen (pronouncing it, eye-boo-pro-fin"" instead of, ""eye-byou-pro-fin""). I will avoid purchasing audiobooks narrated by her in the future.""",2016-12-14 14:10:28,A Love Letter to Whiskey,"romance,young-adult"

 I enjoyed this book more than any other book in this series. Like the others, INNOCENCE #3 does not contain unexpected twists or awe inspiring, jaw dropping plots that I have learned to expect from Alessandra Torre, yet this book came closer than the others. The huge difference between the first book in the series and this one is remarkable. I don't know how Ms. Torre did it or if she was changed in someway during the years between these books but it's almost like a lightbulb went off and history was made.... in this book, I finally saw the clever, unique Torre writing style I love. Also impressive in this third and final installment is the incredibly erotic, descriptive, HOT HOT HOT sex scenes! At times, it was impossible not to, ""see"" an image of the characters and what they were doing due to Ms. Torre's uncanny ability to articulate every nuance, position, sound, etc. Alessandra, you rocked the sex world in this book! And, true colors came out; The creative story line demonstrates that you are capable of writing more than a basic, average romance! 
 I listened to INNOCENCE#1-3 via Audible audiobooks. The first 2 books were narrated by MacKenie Cartwright; I had given her performance 5 star ratings for each of the first two books. However, after listening to Devra Woodward narrate this book, I can't imagine anyone else capable of filling this role (sorry MacKenzie)!

 What a delightful book! This is my first book by Valerie Bowman but it will definitely not be my last, The Untamed Earl is the fifth book in the Playful Brides series. I have so much catching up to do and I'm so excited to read about the other brides! 
 This is Alexandra and Owen's book, Alex recently had her coming out ball but although she's been introduced to the ton she can't marry until her older sister, Lavinia has been married off. But don't worry Alex already has her eye on the infamous Lord Owen Monroe and as soon as she's able, will marry him and live blissfully ever after. Imagine her dismay when she eavesdrops on her parents while they are planning Lavinia and Owen's betrothal! 
 One of the accomplishments, Alex would like to achieve: 
 ""Marry my true love. Must be handsome, dashing, witty, kind, true and honorable. Name to be determined later."" 
 What ensues Alex's diabolical plan which includes thwarting Lord Owen's attempts at courting Lavinia and ensuring that Lord Owen finally notices her therefore falling hopelessly in love with her! 
 I feel like shouting ""Another!"" like Thor lol. Alex stole the show to be quite honest, I've decided I'm adding her to my list of funny, intelligent and sweet heroines! 
 *walks off to make list* 
 Owen enlisted the help of Alex in winning over Lavinia, but I'm sure he never expected her to tell him exactly what wouldn't make her fall in love with him! I was in stitches! 
 ""I'd ask you to dance, but I have a feeling you'd say no."" 
 ""You're correct, my lord."" Lavinia replied. 
 ""Would you care for a rock?"" 
 ""Lavinia gave him a look that clearly indicated he might have lost his mind. 
 Alex was shameless in her pursuit of Owen, and rightfully since Owen needed quite the nudge to realise his feelings. Lavinia was an absolute ogre, oh my goodness I can't even begin to explain what a terrible person she was. And while reading I'd thought perhaps she could redeem herself in another book but I'm not sure I want her to! 
 I also loved ""The Playful Brides"" who took Alex under their wing! Cass, Lucy and Jane were so entertaining and were one of the reasons I decided to read the rest of this series! 
 I'd definitely recommend The Untamed Earl to anyone looking for a light, playful and funny historical romance!

 Well seriously I have no idea how to review this one... Quite frankly I've never read a Biker romance like this. I'm not even sure if I should call it a romance, yes there's love and a lot of sex but I hesistate to call it a romance. This book was some kind of effed up, the characters and their lifestyle was depraved to the max. They weren't easily likable, the stuff they did was selfish and quite frankly unbelievable, but for some reason I also feel quite protective of them I although I can't sympathise with them, I can most certainly empathise. 
 Jenna is saved from a life that would have probably ended in a brutal death. The man who saves her walks in on a horrific scene, 16 year old Jenna is being beaten and raped by two men. Unfortunately this has been happening for sometime. He brings her to his home and MC, a place that is a lot more different than the one she came from. 
 Her new life begins, she now has a mother and father figure, and although her past is one that's robbed her of her innocence she doesn't let that stop her from living and enjoying her new life. She quickly latches on to Kid the future president of the Renegades. He dotes on her, he's protective of her but when their friendship takes a turn and lust says ""Hello I'm here"" things get beyond f#cked up. 
 Kid and Jenna are self-destructive, Kid's guilt over his lust for an under age girl pushes him into acting like a f#ck-wit. He screws around and waves all his floozies in Jenna's face. Jenna retaliates by finding love else where which infuriates Kid. Yes she sleeps around, and quite frankly it was a low point for her, but Kid made up for it in spades. 
 Lastly Renegade Lady isn't an easy book to read, the characters aren't easy to like but it is a captivating story. There are no fairytale endings with red bows on top, the ending is a good one, but it also suits this story and it's characters. 
 I like this gif, it has nothing to do with this story :)

 This book was the epitome of a romcom!!! I enjoyed reading it so much, I was in fits of laughter! Emma is one seriously sassy chick, who knows what she wants and makes no apologies when she goes after it! 
 Luke is a hot as sin, bad ass tattoo artist, who, when he sees Emma walk into his shop for the first time is immediately drawn to her and doesn't even try to hide it! Make no mistake Emma is just as attracted to him as he is to her. But is held back by a previous relationship gone ugly. But Luke won't have that and makes it his goal to have Emma in his bed. 
 Emma puts up a little bit of a fight but ultimately gives in to his indisputable prowess! Emma made me laugh so hard, her internal dialogue is crazy! 
 There were quite a few characters in this story and they all brought something to the story. Emma's family was absolutely wonderful and so cute. The scene where Emma's sister calls her because she thinks her husband is cheating on her was hilarious! 
 Her brother Calland was your textbook annoying little brother and he proved himself every chance he could get! Emma and Luke together were absolutely hottt! I thought their first time was hot and then Emma had to say ""Show me your dark side Luke!"" And boy did he show her!!! God I love dominant men!!! Okay so I don't wanna ruin the story for you guys but there was one scene where everyone had been watching T.V. and then they all fell asleep in front of the T.V. My poor prudish heart was at first like... 
 and then I was like... 
 Hahaha!!! Totally didn't see that one coming! 
 Okay why did I only give this book 3.5 Stars you ask? 
 I felt like the story was finished at about 60%, nothing more to say here. You no finished! But there was the unfinished issue of a stalker. Emma has a stalker, obviously this is quite serious. But I felt like it was abandoned, I mean there were a few dropped calls, some heavy breathing and a few presents. But not once did Emma feel the need to tell Luke about it! I mean WTF??? 
 I won't go into further detail but the issue was ultimately resolved obviously because this story does have a happy ending. But before it was resolved, we were told some unnecessary crap by Emma. It didn't slowly lead up to the climax, it was just a bunch of scenes right near the end of the book. I didn't see the point, a lot of what happened could have happened much earlier on. So that's why I took one and a half stars off. 
 But although it was annoying the book was enjoyable. I would definitely recommend reading it. It was light, funny and the writing style flowed well. I felt like I was listening to a friend tell me about her super hot boyfriend and their amazing sex life!

 I'm not as attached to Kvothe as I'd like, though. I liked him, but I just didn't feel as...familiar with him as some of my favourite fantasy main characters.

 5 stars!!! 
 ""How long have we been in love?"" 
 Wish You Were Here will be on my 2017 favourites shelf at the end of the year, without a doubt. There was so much about this book that I fell in love with and Renee Carlino has proven once again that she never fails to deliver. Wish You Were Here was simply stunning, a breath-taking story about love and loss, soul mates and lightening striking twice. This story was incredibly moving, extremely poignant and just an awe-inspiring piece of writing from the very beginning. 
 ""Do you believe in soul mates, Charlotte?"" 
 ""I think so..."" 
 ""Do you want to know what I think?"" 
 ""What?"" 
 ""I think we have soul mates, but I think we can have more than one..."" 
 Many, many tears were shed reading this book, the prose incredibly moving and Renee Carlino extracted all those emotions with effortless ease. The character connection was on point, the dialogue was simply perfect and the humour interspersed with emotional prose was the perfect balance. Renee Carlino captured her characters perfectly and brought them to life over the pages to the point where you become the voyeur looking in. I felt that I was an innocent bystander watching the lives of these characters play out before my eyes and it is that connection that makes this book all the more consuming. 
 I don't want to go into the plot at all as I do not want to spoil it for anyone and this is one book that you need to read as the author intended. This is a book all about the journey and you need to experience this one word for word and let Renee Carlino's flawless writing envelope and consume you as much as it did me. 
 Charlotte was flighty by nature, in her late twenties, starting and abandoning many university courses and never having found her purpose in life, she is a little lost. Men are not top of her priority list either, many failed relationships have led to her being extremely jaded and second guessing her ability to be loved. One night she meets Adam, and totally out of character has a one-night stand she will never forget. They had a connection, one she has never felt before and one she fears she will never feel again. 
 ""That's what happens when you live it well, right? When you have someone to love? It goes by fast. You blink and it's over."" 
 Adam is a character that will remain with me for a very, very long time and that is all I am going to say about our lawyer/artist. Other than he was simply adorable on so many levels. The growth in Charlotte throughout this book was amazing. In the beginning, she was a little hard to warm up to, but as she grew, so did my feelings towards her. Charlotte's heart shone throughout this book and it is her selflessness that ingratiates her to the reader. 
 ""Because I don't want you to stop asking."" 
 This book was simply stunning, it took turns I never saw coming and some that I did. As I said above, flawlessly written, emotional, poignant and one heck of a fantastic read. Simply adored it.

400,31549837,5,"""A Love Letter to Whiskey by Kandi Steiner 
 5 stars!!! 
 ""...no one warned me that once a whiskey girl, always a whiskey girl."" 
 This was my first read by Kandi Steiner and it definitely won't be my last, in fact, this book is one of my favourite reads of the year. Anyone that follows my reviews know I am an emotional reader, I relish an emotional read that will make me cry, I crave that emotional connection to a book, to characters, to their story as a whole and Kandi Steiner delivered this in spades, boy did she deliver. 
 ""Words don't get written from a heart that's never felt. They come from pain, from love, from unspeakable depths - and they were my only release."" 
 Character connection, man did these characters come to life, from the first few lines Kandi Steiner held me captive for an entire book. I had been in a funk, I had tried to read for a fair few days, nothing caught my attention and for a girl that reads a book a day this was seriously bad, but I picked up A Love Letter to Whiskey and Kandi Steiner brought my mojo back with a vengeance. I devoured this book, I cried A LOT, I was frustrated A LOT but most of all, I loved A LOT. This is one angsty ride, one of the most angst filled books I have read in a while and I needed it. Those tears were cathartic, this story consumed me and for the first time in a while I escaped and these characters are ones that have a permanent place in my heart. They earned it. 
 ""Jamie was never officially mine, but I had always been his - ever since the first taste."" 
 This book is filled with raw emotion, thoughts, feelings and actions that hit exactly where the author intended. Where two people that were destined to be together were their own worst enemy. The time was never right, their minds were never in the right place, but their hearts were, their hearts belonged to one and other. This story spans a decade, a decade of friendship, of love, of heart ache. A decade of hiding feelings and depriving the heart of who the heart wants, a decade of miscommunication, a decade of fear, a decade of tangible desire, lust and love seemingly unreciprocated by either party. Their frustrating walls that they both had erected were the biggest obstacle, one that I wanted to rip down brick by brick, but I needn't have bothered, because Kandi Steiner did it for me, eloquently, beautifully, perfectly, frustratingly, agonisingly, tortuously slowly. But, this book was perfect, this was B and Jamie's story. 
 ""But sometimes, even when we know something is bad for us, we do it anyway. Maybe for the thrill, maybe to cure our curiosity, or maybe just to lie to ourselves a little longer."" 
 B and Jamie first become friends in high school, it was unusual for best friends to be the opposite sex, but these two just worked. Their friendship was tangible but you always knew that the chemistry they shared blurred the lines of friendship but these two were stubborn. A love born from friendship though is extremely special, you know that person inside out, you love them for their strengths and you love them for their weaknesses, you love them for their flaws and you love them fiercely and these two definitely did that. Sometimes too much love can be a bad thing and for me their fear of crossing that line and tarnishing what they had was the one thing that held them back rather than being the bungee cord that bound them together. 
 ""It turned out a Whiskey stain was just as permanent as ink, and I wondered if I would every truly was myself clean. Or if I even wanted to."" 
 This book is brutal, emotionally brutal, my heart felt decimated so many times throughout but this was an honest portrayal of one of the most epic love stories I have read. The characters were real, their actions were real, their thoughts were real and it was this that made it that much more relatable. Their actions were not out of the realms of possibility, it could happen to anyone, it does happen ALL THE TIME and knowing this is what really captures your heart and pulls at every single heart string. I lived this book, I breathed this book, I felt everything in this book, these characters totally consumed me for hours. I had palpitations, I screamed, I wanted to batter these two but most of all, I loved them, wholly and implicitly. Both were adorable, both were pig headed, both annoyed the hell out of me at times, but both of them loved each other. Their love was at the end of the rainbow, neither chancing to find its end, they get there but will it all be too late? 
 ""I'm sorry that up until now, I saw you as something I should quit instead of something I should fight for."" 
 I loved the references to Whiskey, for B, Jamie was Whiskey and the references to B's love of Jamie and its connection to Whiskey the drink made for some truly memorable quotes. I cannot say anything negative about this book, for me it was perfection, in truth I could say I want more, but that is a good thing, I didn't want to let these characters go. I wanted to stay in my B and Whiskey bubble. 
 ""Sometimes we're more terrified of the good things in life than we are of the bad. We feel we don't deserve them, or that they aren't real, that they'll disappear quickly and easily and we'll be left in the ruins."" 
 So in summary, if you want an emotional, angsty, beautiful, frustrating, epic read, then this is your book. Have tissues and a large glass of your favourite tipple to hand, bubble wrap your kindle, kick back and enjoy, I did and I still haven't recovered.

401,24890983,4,"""By Any Other Name (Forbidden #1) by JM Darhower 
 4.5 stars!! 
 ""Their families didn't just carry animosity - they were mortal enemies, hell-bent on destroying each other. The two of them were a disaster waiting to happen, and they had just been fooling themselves if they thought anything good could come out of this thing."" 
 There is no doubt in my mind that JM Darhower is the queen of Mafia, no matter the story JM Darhower always manages to draw me in to this corrupt underground and always leaves me salivating for more at the end. 
 There is nothing like a forbidden love story and throw into the mix that the end consequence is literally life or death, then the term ""forbidden"" takes on a whole new meaning. JM Darhower weaves a tale full of suspense and intrigue, a modern twist on Romeo and Juliet where the romance was condemned even before it began. A connection that was born as strangers but when identities are revealed the world crashes down, a connection and love so fierce and intense, that no matter the consequences they just couldn't stay away. Could they get away with it or would this be the end for them and their families? 
 ""It's too late for me, though. I already looked the soul-stealer in the eyes."" 
 This book is centred around the Barsanti's and the Galante's, two Mafia families in New York that were once friends but their friendship turned deadly and toxic sixteen years ago. Through bloodshed, death and violence the families would never recover and an intense rivalry and mafia war was born. 
 ""The only good Barsanti is a dead Barsanti."" 
 Matty-B (Matteo Barsanti) has tried to stay away from ""the family business,"" having been sent away for his own protection initially he has never wanted to be a part of his father's business. However, a sick mother brings him back to New York and having been away for so long means that he is way out the loop and does not recognise anyone anymore. He went away a child and has come back a man. 
 Genna was the only Galante daughter and as such was intensely protected and sheltered. But when that protection becomes over bearing, she acts out as a small act of defiance against her father. Her father calls her bluff though and lets her take punishment for her misdemeanours. It is while stuck in an elevator at the court house that Genna and Matty meet. 
 Through Matty's absence and Genna's ""protection"" neither one recognises the other. Neither one realises that they are fraternizing with the enemy. With only being on a first named basis the penny doesn't drop and over drinks and a coupling that goes totally against their norm a connection is born that is so strong and so magnetising, neither one can stay away from the other despite trying. 
 ""He played her body like an instrument, plucking her strings and stroking her keys, leaving her a quivering mess yet again."" 
 While reading, you know that nothing good can come of this union, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, just waiting for the war to begin, just waiting for the repercussions and I was constantly dreading the fall out. I read as slowly as I possibly could so that I could devour every word, every emotion. While their connection was kind of insta lust in the beginning, their relationship develops slowly, all cloak and dagger and subterfuge. It is this lure of the forbidden that keeps those pages turning, that draws you into their relationship so deep that you cannot let go. I had an intense connection to these two characters; neither were interested in what the family did and what they were doing. This was the first time that either of them had found love and why should two surnames keep them away from what they both wanted? Why should a family war keep them from what they desired, keep them from who they love? 
 ""But that's all there is...The after. Every moment is just the aftermath of whatever came before it."" 
 This is a story about families, loyalty, loathing, turf wars, protection, trust and love. A story that could never have a fairy tale ending but would the protagonists die trying? Families so intent on destroying each other that they cannot see the bigger picture. Where that intense rivalry, clouds judgements and actions and can only end one way...the wrong way. 
 This was a rollercoaster ride; I ran the gamut of emotions, fear being the most prevalent. I was constantly anxious, my heart was beating erratically and I desperately didn't want this book to end. I loved Matty's fierce love for Genna, his protectiveness and willingness to put everything on the line for the one thing that he has forever desired, to be loved. Seeing that reciprocated only makes you warm to them even more, you cannot help but champion these two, you are constantly willing love to conquer all, even with that deep dread seated in the pit of your stomach. 
 ""They were merely standing in the eye of the hurricane...and it only stayed calm for so long."" 
 Once again JM Darhower has nailed it and I cannot wait to read more of this series. Bring it on!

403,15847757,5,"""Iniquity (The Premonition Series #5) by Amy Bartol 
 5 stars!! 
 ""All you have done is create a debt to iniquity."" 
 This was a book I have been waiting years for yet when the time was approaching for its release I didn't want to read. Sometimes you become so attached to a series that when the end is in sight you really don't want to read because you know it will be the last and that is exactly how I felt when I picked up this book. 
 ""I'm the light to his darkness. There's no escape; he's a part of me."" 
 This series was also a first for me, this was my first paranormal read ever. It was a genre I had body swerved at every opportunity yet an author I trusted said you must read it and from that point on my love of everything Amy Bartol was born. I fell in love with her writing voice, the vivid descriptions, these worlds, languages and characters that are all borne from Amy Bartol's imagination. A world that she creates with flair and becomes so real you cannot help but envelope yourself in these characters lives and battles. This is one series that I would love to see on the big screen, I can picture it now, it would be totally EPIC! 
 ""My wings spread wide, like a red stain beyond my pale skin. I'm dancing now for the thrill of it."" 
 So...this is the end...this was an extremely bittersweet read and I savoured every word. I read the slowest I have ever read so I didn't miss a thing. I received so many answers and they were all delivered with clarity and acceptance. We finally get to really understand the connections between the characters, especially Evie and Reed, Xavier, Russell and Brennus. Each character has a pivotal role in Evie's development and her cause and I expected nothing less. Every person had their part to play and in this epic culmination of this series Amy Bartol explained everything in depth and with at times heart wrenching clarity. No matter what team you were on I feel the end was true to the characters that we have become to love throughout this series. 
 ""I'm clutching the invisible thread that binds me to her. I won't let her go, not for anything in this world."" 
 I always knew that this series was going to end up in the mother of all battles and I wasn't disappointed. Sheol and Heaven come to blows in one of the most descriptive and visceral scenes I have ever come across in words. I could picture it all, I imagined it all and I definitely felt it all. Yes, I cried, but as you know I am a soft sap but again that is testament to Amy Bartol's writing, I have such an affinity for these characters that I couldn't help but live their lives together with their emotional and physical distress. Amy Bartol really brought this series to a magnificent crescendo and this is one series that I will never ever forget and will definitely be re-reading. 
 ""Most souls, when they emerge from their bodies, are luminous, the brighter the light, the more vibrant the soul. There's an absence of illumination from Emil as he claws his way from his corpse. He's a black hole devouring radiance."" 
 I am not going to go into anything with regards to plot because that would be criminal. Is there a happy ever after...yes but the last few paragraphs really make you think? Personally I don't think that this was an attempt to prolong this series at all but was more a shout out to those fans that had supported this particular character throughout the series, it will certainly be a topic for many discussions and probably many an outrage but for me, Evie's story came full circle and she had finally found her feet and her purpose in life. 
 ""Your tristitiae - I'm your sorrow."" 
 ""No,"" Brennus says with eyes softening for a moment. 
 ""Ye're me love."" 
 I have to give a shout out to Brennus, while I was never on his ""team"" I never once doubted his affections and intentions towards Evie but Amy Bartol really brought to life this arrogant, Irish, fallen faerie. His dialect had me crying with laughter at times and his witty one liners really balanced this book with much needed entertainment, I have to say he had some of the best quotes in this book and I have to admit I have an extremely soft spot for him. 
 ""When ye get back, come find me mo chroi. I've healed ye...now wake up and banjax whoever banished ye here..."" 
 Reed and Evie together were a formidable force and once again my heart and soul were with this fearless couple. With their band of friends that have always been there for each other this little army were as tight as ever and always had each other's backs. Russell, Zee, Buns and Brownie all have their parts to play and their solidarity towards one another was great to read especially when the odds are stacked against them. 
 ""I could no more leave you than the earth could leave the sun. You'll always draw me back to you."" 
 With the past coming back to fight another day this team have a lot of demons to battle but I loved the unity that Amy Bartol brought to this finale. Even those perceived as unredeemable proved themselves when the chips were down and this really wrapped up this fight between good and evil. 
 ""I made her stronger. I made her the perfect adversary. I'm the Yin to her Yang. She's the light that cannot exist without my darkness."" 
 To say I have loved this series would be an epic understatement and while I am seriously gutted it is over I hope that one day Amy Bartol may bring them to life once again.

404,17325147,5,"""Left Drowning by Jessica Park 
 5 ugly crying, puffy eyed, nose running inducing stars!! 
 OMG OMG OMG, I have to write this straight away whilst I am emotionally distraught, I cannot convey how much I cried whilst reading this book...I should really post a picture of the mess of a face I was left with but I wouldn't want to scare you all away, but I was a total and utter wreck. I am an emotional person anyways and I do cry fairly easily, but this was embarrassing. It wasn't even as if the event that triggered this total and utter sob fest was ""that bad"" but I was so pulled into this story emotionally and mentally it felt like my own heart was breaking, no scratch that, it was ripped out, stamped out, stabbed a few times and tossed in the trash. Jessica Park, you killed me.....I am distraught, I have run out of tissues and my husband thinks I am an utter fruit loop, but other than that I am OK, just. 
 This book pulls you in from the dedication:- 
 ""For Tommy, who is and will always be, my Sabin. 
 This book is for everyone who has survived. You are not broken. You can love and be loved, depite what may feel like the eternally brutal nature of the world. Even when you're drowning and so far under, there is always time to reach for someone who will teach you how to breathe again."" 
 I was not sure what to expect when I started reading this, after reading Flat Out Love and Flat Out Matt I was thinking it would be another one of those quirky books that suits Jessica's personality to a T, we have seen her wicked sense of humour all over Facebook, she cracks me up daily but this was sooooo different. This book was deep, meaningful, emotional, beautifully written and most of all captivating, I could not put it down. 
 Blythe, beautiful, brilliant, Blythe, she was still grieving for a lot of things, the loss of her parents four years earlier and also the loss of her relationship with her brother. That tragic night had destroyed everything that Blythe knew, she took herself off to Uni and made sure that she was unnoticeable. She kept herself to herself, did not have a roommate, never socialised, just plodded through the crap that was her life, she felt she was a nothing, no use to anyone, she would drink herself into stupors just to forget, just to try and be something even just for a short while, but it never worked, it was always so much worse in the mornings. She goes for a stroll and happens to chance upon a man at the lake, she stares, she watches, she feels that there is some instant connection to this stranger and she feels pulled. Unlike Blythe in any shape or form she makes a move and talks. 
 Chris, the said stranger, he too a broken soul, we always knew he was hiding something, but Jessica leaks his past slowly throughout the book and it just adds to the suspense of the story. I did have an inkling as to where the plot twist would come and I was right, but as it was revealed my heart just broke all over again. It is like a car crash, you can see it happening and you just brace yourself for the impact, but when it hits you, you feel the shock and the pain, then you freeze....you pat yourself down, check that you are OK and then sit back and wonder what the hell just happened. Well, Jessica Park just came up and hit you smack between the eyes!! 
 Some may say that this is a insta love, it is and it isn't, they both feel the connection immediately, but it is not acted upon for a long time. Blythe too scared to say or do anything and Chris wanting to but feels that he is too broken to offer anything. They become friends, along with the rest of the Shepherd family. 
 I love this family, this is where Jessica really gets her wicked sense of humour across, Sabin and Estelle were amazeballs. I love it when a book totally engrosses you with all the side characters and every side character in this book had a major part to play. Some may say Sabin was annoying, he was brilliant, the friendship that he and Blythe built was so touching and so needed for both of them, it was beautiful. Estelle, some may say crazy, but what an amazing best friend, even though she was hurting herself, the strength she passed to Blythe was courageous despite battling her own demons. Eric and Zach, such a cute couple, you just loved them. It was such a tight knit family and they all just welcomed Blythe with open arms. 
 Blythe and Chris ground each other, whilst in the beginning it is Chris that brings Blythe out of her pity party, it soon becomes apparent that Chris needs rescuing from his own and Blythe wants to be the person to do it. The trouble is that Chris, whilst he wants to be rescued, it takes him a long time to realise it, he believes that he cannot be fixed, that he is not worthy and so he does something so incredibly stupid I could have killed him myself...I wanted to jump in the kindle and throttle him. 
 Throughout this book, you feel the connection building, it is palpable, it pulls you in like a moth to a flame and you cannot move away from the light, you keep reading, you become more emotionally invested, you fall in love with the characters, you fall in love with the story and then bam...you are hit by that light, that ugly zap that tries to kill you outright..and boy did it kill me. I was like, no this cannot be happening, this is not what should be happening and you carry on reading like a sadist thinking FFS, this is not blinking happening...but it does and it carries on and you cannot help but continue. 
 But alas, do not worry my dear readers, the world does right its axis eventually but not after you have been eaten, chewed, spat out and left for dead...but it is a truly brilliant read. No matter how many the tears I spilled I could read this over and over and over again...yes I am willing to put myself through that again, but it was a joy to read. 
 This is a story about loss, grief, learning to live again, survival, learning to love and trust and most of all learning to heal and forgive. 
 This review is testament to Jessica's writing, it does cover some hard hitting subjects, especially child abuse but it is done sensitively, thoughtfully but most of all it is heart breaking. You feel everything! It is very difficult for an author to make you feel ""this much"", only a few books have managed to do this to me and I am always shocked when they do, you always know when that happens you have read a brilliant book, and this book is truly brilliant. 
 I cannot recommend this book highly enough, but make sure you have loads of tissues to hand because if you are like me, you are going to need them. 
 Oh and Jessica, I want that T-Shirt......You've hit 70%....now cry like a b***h!!

406,186074,4,"""Once I got over the eye-strain of the teensy weensy print in the paperback, I quite enjoyed this book. The memoir style makes for a nice relationship between the reader and the writing, although it'll be interesting to see how Rothfuss wears the confines he's set for himself re: the setup. (That is to say, the three-day semi-spontaneously-narrated style, as able to be recorded phonetically in shorthand ) 
 Kvothe is a character who feels almost designed to chafe at his audience--absurdly talented, arrogantly aware of it, with a penchant for the dramatic, with a satisfying blend of the heroic/romantic and the prideful/selfish. He is certainly the crown jewel of the book, a testament to considerable effort on Rothfuss's part to create a fantastic but balanced story, of a guy who has certainly made his share of boneheaded moves but is generally resourceful enough to deal with them. 
 Nonetheless, this is quite a long drag of a book, not always well-suited to binge reading. Partly because of the painfully tiny print, I often felt I only had a few chapters in me at a time, and had to slow my pace down to avoid getting totally lost. Which is ironic, because then there were passages that read so PAINFULLY slowly that it felt as though they went on for hours, with nothing to show for it at the end. I suspect loose ends were left dangling for future books to pick up, still, Kvothe's indulgence in a mind-drilling level of detail is not always appreciated. 
 And my main beef is that I think it was a cheap shot to handle the ending that way. He essentially stops cold and says 'Done talking now' and little tweaks in the framework don't really fix that.  That makes it hard to see The Name of the Wind as a self-contained book, and I suspect some serious sequel-teasing the likes of which I've rarely encountered. It smacks a little of both author and narrator abusing the privilege of their roles. Tell them a story, build to your climax, then shut your mouth and walk away. Readers will rightfully feel cheated, and whether it's an artistic choice or not, it's a little mean. I think the transition between books one and two could have been more elegantly handled, even without losing that sense of suspense. But hey, I'm not a published author, or an editor, or anything but a supremely experienced fantasy/sci-fi reader, so maybe I'm supposing too much. 
 Still, The Name of the Wind got me excited about fantasy in a way I haven't been since discovering Brandon Sanderson. Reminding me why it's fun, and why it's cool, and how deeply a well-written work can get me interested in a world of utter fiction. Big names like Goodkind and Jordan have failed to impress me in this way, so kudos to The Name of the Wind and I look forward to finding the time to pick up the sequel...and a pair of reading glasses, probably.""",2015-06-04 11:09:44,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)","fantasy,paranormal,fiction,young-adult,romance"
407,14064,2,"""Okay, that was so not my jams... 
 I get the feeling I'm missing something, because all the top-rated GR reviews seem to adore this book. But in a book this short, it's probably all or nothing. You either really like the ""procedural philosophy/theorizing 80%, action 20%"" formula, or you really don't. (To be clear, I'm counting things like ""driving to Sears"" in that action percentage). And you either get totally turned off by Robert Neville's character, or you find him somehow representative of more than the sum of his vices and don't mind him so much. Guess I'm the type that minds. 
 It's not like I want edge-of-my-seat action sequences or anything, I just don't find it entertaining to read a book that gets all meta- like that. I Am Legend leaps distractingly between sparse descriptions of Neville's day, sparse descriptions of Neville's past, and extended let's-be-all-cerebral-about-this jaunts through philosophy and theory-based pseudo-science and morality and what it all MEANS. The problem is, if I wanted to analyze things to that depth, I would do it myself. Being forced through those particular mental contortions isn't high on my to-do list. So if you loved your college philosophy courses, by all means give I Am Legend a shot. It's a small enough time commitment, after all. But I would much rather have been told a decent story and been left to ponder the finer points of morality and such myself. 
 Even when we get into the ""let's modernize vampires"" sequences, it reads as plodding and overly cerebral. Really, I think it's a product of the way the book's set up. Yes, I understand that we spent the entire book in Neville's head, and that creates a sense of isolation and a oneness of thinking indicative of his ""last man on earth"" status, and all that good stuff. I'm just saying, if you write a book that's essentially one giant internal monologue, it's going to bore some folks. 
 And if the internal monologue is that of an unlikeable character, well, you get yourself a pretty lousy rating. 
 For me, that's really the bottom line--I cannot stand Robert Neville. I can't stand his ""why me"" resigned whining, or his scathing and disgusting views on women, or his self loathing or his drinking problem. I do not want to spend even five pages in his head. I don't want to hear him b*tch and moan to himself as he grows plants, whittles wood, falls down drunk, or other such exciting activities. I don't give a darn whether he lives or dies, how he does it, or what he thinks about doing it. This apathy left me completely cold, even through what I imagine was conceptualized as a dramatic, poignant ending. (Plus having Neville articulate that last line makes the whole thing feel intolerably contrived. Like Matheson came up with a punchline and liked it so much he decided to write a 160-page joke to go with it. ) 
 I actually attempted to listen to the audiobook of I Am Legend about four years ago. I tried three separate times to start it, and gave up all three times because (at no fault of the reader) hearing that repugnant narrative voice spoken aloud was enough to make me want to throw my iPod across the room. So there was bad blood between I Am Legend and me long before I managed to finally pick it up and get through it. 
 So from what I can tell, it's peoples' views on the Neville character that polarize the reviews so much. People who love the book like being in Neville's head. People who hate it can't stand being in Neville's head. I fell into the latter category. I think I Am Legend managed to scrape two stars because by the time I decided I wasn't enjoying the book it was already over. If I'd been put through twice as many pages of that freaking narrative voice, it might've cost another star. But it was short, if not sweet, so I'll gift it the second star.""",2014-03-20 17:46:28,I Am Legend,"fiction,fantasy,paranormal,mystery,thriller,crime"
408,59980,5,"""Brief History: 
 To be honest, I have actually first heard about Batman through the 90s cartoon series ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" which apparently, I have actually had my first exposure to the world of comics through so many animated series throughout the 90s. Since I have been reading a lot of comics lately, especially the ""X-Men"" comics, I wanted to try a different comic book series and that is where I started reading up on ""Batman."" So, the first ""Batman"" comic I have actually came upon recently is a little gem that I have just noticed lately and that is ""Batman: Year One"" by Frank Miller along with artwork by David Mazzucchelli along with coloring by Richmond Lewis. ""Batman: Year One"" is truly a brilliant comic book that newer fans of ""Batman"" can easily get into! 
 What is this story about? 
 This story basically retells the origins of Bruce Wayne as Batman as it details Bruce Wayne's first year as Batman and all the struggles he overcomes in his new role as Batman. This story also details about Commissioner James Gordon's first year as a lieutenant of the police force before he became a commissioner. 
 What I loved about this story: 
 Frank Miller's writing: Frank Miller's writing was so amazing and simple to read through, especially if you are new to the ""Batman"" comics and you need a good place to jump right in the series. Frank Miller has created a more modern spin on the origins of Batman without changing the original history of Batman (his parents are killed before him when he was a child and he decides to become the famous caped crusader he is today) and I especially loved the way that Frank Miller details Batman's first year fighting crime as being difficult since Bruce Wayne had difficulties in becoming the crime fighting caped crusader since the public viewed him as a menace the moment he started fighting crime. I also loved the way that Frank Miller shown the months that all of this was taking place from January fourth to December third which gave an extremely detailed timeline of this story. What really interested me about this story was learning about the origins of Commissioner James Gordon since I have not really been exposed to his origins and it was interesting to see how James Gordon actually started out as a lieutenant of a police force that was corrupted by the crimes of Gotham City and how he tried to do his best to protect the citizens of Gotham City from such criminal activities. 
 David Mazzucchelli and Richmond Lewis' artwork: David Mazzucchelli and Richmond Lewis' artwork is simplistic yet gives a dramatic feel to the story, especially during the scenes where the characters are in shadows and they give out an eerie feel to the scene they are associated with, like during the scene where James Gordon is attacked by hit men and Richmond Lewis' red coloring that flashes on the characters' faces makes this scene extremely intense as you can see the pain and sorrow on James Gordon's face. I also loved the shadowing that Richmond Lewis applies to Batman as Batman is usually shown in the dark and the dark shadowing makes him look menacing. 
 What made me feel uncomfortable about this story: 
 The only problem with this comic book novel is that there is some blood in some scenes, especially during the scenes where some of the characters are shot. Also, there is some language in this book that might offend some readers, so if you do not like dark themed books that deal with crimes in the cities, then this graphic novel might be hard to read through. 
 Final Thoughts: 
 Overall, ""Batman: Year One"" is not only a brilliant read for ""Batman"" fans everywhere, but it is also a great place to get into the ""Batman"" comic series, especially for new fans who are just getting into the ""Batman"" comics and want to know how Batman's origins came about!

 As I don't want to sound more pompous than I already do, lets just say, that the story is catching, the characters realistic and magical at the same time, and the world feels manifold with deep history, wide geography and various cultures. But what I find most fascinating is plenty of inner stories, legends and songs. This said, I can't stop myself from comparing Rothfuss with Tolkien, and as a great fan of the latter, I am surprised to find their creation equally enchanting. 
 Poetic but not sugary, voluble but not stodgy, The Name of the Wind left me starving for more, with three kinds of silence inside and around me.""",2012-09-05 11:39:28,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)","fantasy,paranormal,fiction,young-adult,romance"
410,17449965,4,"""I absolutely love that cover. It's stunning and really reminds me of Eve, from Adam and Eve - which I suspect is exactly what it is. The rosy red of the apple has never looked so tempting and taking a bite? Ohh honey, such the wrong thing to do, but staying away, you just can't. You have to take a bite. It's too tempting. 
 That is exactly what Great Exploitations is about. Tempting the married man to have a one-night stand to ensure that the pre-nup they made their wives have, is now null due to the Infidelity clause. Not only do the wives get a share of the money, so does the Eve and the business. 
 Great Exploitations is the first in a novella series. The main character goes by Sienna in this book. She is a Eve - a member of a secret elite of beautiful woman hired by unhappy wives of cheating, rich men to seduce and sleep with the husbands who have made them sign a prenup. If they divorced them, they would get nothing, but catching them in the act? Well, they will get half of their husbands money due to a little thing in the prenup called The Infidelity Clause. 
 The agency is owned by 'G', who scouts for her Eves and transforms them into the seductive women they are today. G scouted Sienna five years ago, and turned her into the temptress she is today. 'Sienna' or whomever she is, is one of the top Eves. She puts a lot of effort into her job; from nitpicking every little detail about the Target, to transforming herself into his perfect woman, to making sure she has his complete and undivided attention on her so she can get the job done. 
 She's good at her job and that's how she wants to keep it. Sienna seems to have no emotions attached to her. She treats sex as sex. No feelings before or after. It's like shes a robot. Programmed to do the steps to hook line and sink the Target. To make sure they are caught and the wives get the money that they deserve when they are shown the pictures the P.I's take of her and the target. 
 The men are tagged by how much money they are worth by the number of zeros in their bank account. Eights and Nines are pretty great but a Ten? That is rare but if one does come around, it's a complete goldmine. A Ten for Sienna would give her the freedom she is looking for and it would set her up for life having all that money in her account. 
 It's a short book, at only 90 pages but there is so much information packed into it. Nicole Williams takes you through a journey about who the Eves are, what they do and how hard they work to make sure their job is done and dusted to perfection. There is a lot of hard work put into being an Eve. 
 It is a quick read, but one I thoroughly enjoyed. It was brilliantly written, and the concept was such an interesting one to read. You won't want to put it down and from that ending? The rare Ten? Oh I cannot wait to read the next novel in the series. It really leaves you wanting more and wanting to know all about Sienna's past and her ever-growing closeness to her freedom...whatever her freedom really is.""",2013-02-28 02:40:44,"Mischief in Miami (Great Exploitations, #1)","romance,fiction"

412,9752790,2,"""This book hinges on the edge of 2 and 3 stars...so okay, 2.5, and if someone asks me how I liked the series, I'll say that it was just ""okay."" 
 I should have known from the cover that this book wasn't going to end well... But I had hope, I did. I've read enough dystopian/post-apocolyptic series and books to know that people have to die in the end. But for me, I felt this book didn't have any closure. At the end of the 2nd book, I hoped that Pressia and the others would be able to return with their findings and items and build something better. Alas. 
 [POSSIBLE SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.] 
 Sigh. What do I even say? This book did not end well for me. There are so many unanswered questions. Mainly, what happens to everyone in the end? Pressia didn't accomplish her goal: to use to vial and formula to cure to the survivors, those outside the Dome. She found her grandfather, and the burning question I'm sure we all wanted to know was Is her father still alive? In the end, it seems like he still was but ... like I said, there's no closure. I believe it was Arvin Weed who told Pressia that she had something inside of her that could change things and make things work. At first I thought he was talking physically, but I think now it's more emotional and even spiritual. Of all the people, Pressia has held on to hope more than the rest. 
 Now that I'm done reading the trilogy, I can say for sure that Partridge is a coward, and his characters flaws completely outweigh anything that was good in him. He can't escape his father, even after he's dead. He was never in control of anything, and like the very beginning, he was a pawn, he still is towards the end--the favor Iralene asked of him, he kept it, and held back, he didn't do anything--so in my book, he's a coward. I can't bring myself to like him. 
 Lyda, I think, is the one who has made the most change. Once back in the Dome, she realizes she can't go back, can't pretend that things will work with Partridge, and so in the end, she chooses to leave with Pressia and the others. 
 It's interesting that someone pointed out that the Pures would surely all die outside the dome, while the wretches are the strong ones, the ones who have survived through the Detonations. Willux's logic confused me. He wanted to make a superior race but he couldn't see the superior race that was right outside the Dome. He made the mess. Ughhhhh. 
 Anyways, this was an interesting series to read. It's different than most dystopian novels that I've read but like I've stated before, no closure--it didn't end clean. I feel Baggott should/could right another book in the series to help her audience deal with the ending.""",2015-06-10 20:13:59,"Burn (Pure, #3)","young-adult,fiction,fantasy,paranormal,romance"
413,147842,4,"""I just can't get over how amazing this series is! One of the best fantasy novels I've read in a long time. Britain has such a way with words that the descriptions are beautiful, characters relatively easy to relate to, and the plot just keeps you reading! 
 [POSSIBLE SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.] 
 First off, I must say this, I'm still pining that Karigan and King Zachary could somehow be together. I know it sound so silly, especially since both parties know it isn't possible, and that Zachary is to marry Lady Estora (which I'm not opposed to, and grew to like in this book) but...a girl can wish, can't she? Karigan certainly seems to. 
 I think Karigan and Lady Estora provide as a good opposites of each other. Both want something the other one has and when Estora get kidnapped, I think she and Karigan both realize maybe they are better suited for the roles they already have, instead of the ones they want from each other. 
 I admit, though, that even though what's happening at the wall is a big part of the book, I just wanted to skim all of that. I can't get myself to like Alton again, after the first book. I don't want him as a love interest for Karigan but I guess his depression and general angry sort of went through the pages and into me to make me not like him that much, lol. I was, however, interesting in the Riders who went THROUGH the wall because of all that happened with the mages. Britain did a fantastic job telling the history because not only was it new for the audience, but also the characters hearing it for the first time (Dale & Garth). 
 The last 75 pages or so of the book really held me down though. It'll be interesting to see how Karigan's role as an avatar plays out--like she's somewhat of a mouthpiece of the gods. Karigan's title as 
 Knight will also be interesting, and I wonder if this means she'll have a bigger role to play with the king (STILL HOPING).

 On her way home from school, Karigan G'ladheon comes across a half-dead man, black arrows protruding from his back. He beckons her, telling her she must get the message to King Zachary at all costs. Afraid but slightly curious, Karigan accepts his mission and it throws her into a world that she's only heard or read about in books. In her journey to Sacor City to reach the king, Karigan comes across a lot more than she bargained for. She meets good and bad. 
 In all honesty, I really couldn't put the book down. I was engrossed and the book played out like a movie perfectly in my head. A lot of times I wonder if I could have ever done what the main character did, lol. The way Britain portrays magic is different than what I've read in other fantasy novels and I like that. 
 However, I did think the story dragged on for a while, but just when you thought the story was over, there's just a bit more to keep you going. I like that. 
 Also, am I the only one who is slightly rooting for Karigan and the king? That probably sounds so absurd.

 This one was cute for sure, but not as addicting as I had hoped. 
 Claire was a little over-dramatic and I hate to say that because she does have a sad past that does warrant her reactions. There was a lot of potential there but it kind-of fell flat by her irrational actions. I just didn't warm up to her as much as I had hoped. 
 I thought Jake had the best character growth. A lot of that is thanks to Claire and her ability to see him as a person and not a commodity. And in turn, he helps her with her self-confidence. I really enjoyed that aspect of their relationship. I like when romances aid in personal character growth. 
 This was more of a slow burn romance than I anticipated. And for the longest time, I didn't see how these two would ever fall for each other. They were constantly at each other's throats. It takes them a while to reach the point that is described in the synopsis.

416,186074,5,"""I loved this. It was complex and long and detailed and most importantly, I really cared about finding out what happened (and I didn't care when the book ended without us finding out, since Kvothe/Rothfuss was clever enough to wrap up several other intriguing plot points). The genre-savvy-ness of it has me giggling or hooting with laughter at least once per chapter. The device of the main character telling his own story was handled expertly, the magic was well thought out but not overly complicated, Kvothe seems overly powerful and awesome at first, but he is a deeply flawed human being who gets himself into an amazing amount of trouble. Sometimes the plot ran a little too hard on him, to the point that I wanted to look away and stop reading several times, but he always manages to lift himself out again. 
 But. 
 There's always a but. 
 Why? Because despite it's excellence, despite its snappy writing, in so many ways it's just like every other fantasy novel out there. Everything's different here in Fantasyland! The language, the history, the geography, the mythology, even the currency! But don't despair, you'll be comforted by some passing similarities to our own world - men are still in charge, everyone is white, all the women are daughters/wives/mothers or whores/flirts/healers/victims, and the villages/clothing/architecture are all European-style. I mean, there's even a classic scene in which a woman is in the room for no other purpose than to be assaulted by one man and saved by another. She never says a word. She's just there. 
 Why? 
 Who looks around our world in which women are treated like shit, where they were once treated like less than shit (and in many places/situations still are), and goes, ""In my escapist fantasy novel, I'll change everything! But not that.""? 
 To be fair, Rothfuss does better than 90% of Fantasyland, especially in the second half (the review I was writing in my head after the first half was decidedly more scathing). Women start to pop out of the woodwork, and two of them even manage to avoid victim/whore/healer status. Denna, Devi, Fela, Auri, Mola - I really liked all of them. They were smart and interesting and strong...but it almost wasn't enough. They almost all had to be female, according to The Rules - the Lover, the Token Co-ed, the Ethereal One, the Healer. Devi...Devi works. But the characters default to male, except when being female makes things more interesting. 
 Why isn't the Chronicler female? Why isn't Bast female?* Why aren't any of Kvothe's university buddies female? Why aren't any of the regulars at the Waystone female? Why aren't either or both of the owners of the Eolian female? Why are women outnumbered ten to one at the university? Because it's easy. It's easy to just write things ""as they are"" when it comes to women. 
 It just makes it harder for me to escape. 
 God, you'd think I hated it based on what I wrote. I loved it. I loved it like cheesecake, a perfect piece of cheesecake, flavored exotically with key lime and almond. But woman cannot live on cheesecake alone...

 Made the mistake of watching the movie before I had gotten very far in the book. I loved the setting and the idea of this story: a young girl comes to America from Ireland and ends up getting caught between two worlds -- and two men. But the actual details of the story and characters were not so interesting to me. 
 I think to be honest I enjoyed the movie more. Movie Tony is more adorable, book Tony seems more selfish. And while I didn't like one particular plot point, I did think it was handled better in the book. The main character is indecisive and lets things happen to her, which was more clear and also more annoying in the book. I didn't think there was a ton of suspense at the ending but it was slightly different and maybe stronger in the book.

421,8683812,4,"""Hadley and Ernest Hemingway gave each other silly nicknames, lived in Paris surrounded by Important Artists, and had a marriage that collapsed in about five years. Despite the facts of history and the foreshadowing at the front of the book, I still hoped that somehow things would turn out better. 
 The book presents several factors that might have contributed to the marriage failing: Ernest putting his craft above all else, breaches of trust like Hadley losing his manuscripts on a train, the war changing things people once viewed as sacred and permanent, the influence of the couple's bohemian friends with their complicated love lives, etc. At one point it's explained how Hemingway burned his bridges with friends who had been important mentors, and the idea is that he had to cut ties with them almost to prove to himself that he hadn't needed their help to succeed. Perhaps that's what happened with Hadley also. He really did seem to need and love her at first... until he finished The Sun Also Rises. (To his credit, he did at least give her the royalties from it.) 
 It was interesting to see how at the beginning of their marriage, Hadley and Ernest couldn't imagine how the other couples they knew could function the way they did, with open relationships and love triangles and the like. People seemed to view the Hemingways as set apart and above it all, like they were the model of love and if they couldn't make it, no one could. By the end of the book, though, they've turned into the couple with the relationship their newly married friends view with shock and disbelief. 
 The book is mostly written from Hadley's perspective, but there are occasional breaks of short sections written more from Hemingway's point of view. I found these quite powerful and effective. While the pair had decided to be honest and straightforward with each other, the Ernest sections make Hadley's seem meandering. They are raw, real, vibrant, dark, and very briefly manage to explain a lot about just what might have been going on in that man's head. 
 I've read some Hemingway in the past, but it's been a while, and what's stuck in my mind is more the feeling of his writing than the substance of it. There was a list I read once of famous people's made up answers to the question, ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" The Hemingway answer: ""To die. In the rain."" That pretty much sums him up for me. While he seems like kind of a jerk in the book (especially by the end), I think the author did a good job of capturing all that was compelling and exciting and attractive about him as well. I could see why Hadley fell for him as well as what he was drawn to in her.

431,186074,4,"""This is a common review for The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear, the first two books that comprise The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss. While they have been published as two separate books, they are in reality two installments of the same unfinished story, the third installment of which is now being written. Unlike Mistborn and Harry Potter the books do not stand on their own. 
 The two installments are unequal in more respects than mere size. They are estimated (by fantasy-faction.com) to be around 260,000 and 399,000 words long. Over 650k words so far and the story is far from finished. We live in the age of million-word stories. 
 The two installments are unequal in terms of impact too. The first one - at least the first half of the first one - was stunning. The kind of writing that makes even the cynical sit up and take notice. The second pales in comparison. 
 Patrick Rothfuss is one of the better fantasy authors I have read recently. Very good writing that reads like a true epic. The author takes the time and the pages to tell a story well, and without too many modern colloquialisms. This is the kind of writing that one reads for the prose alone. Those who like nuanced prose and like fantasy will find this a truly great read. 
 Those who primarily look for a plot may want to wait for the third (and final?) installment to be published so that they can read the entire plot. 1,600 pages down, the plot remains unclear. 
 The main character (Kvothe) is strong. Very strong. The entire 1,600 pages have been about him. Some would find him tiring. I liked some of the supporting characters - Elodin, Puppet, Auri, Kvothe's parents and as couple of Masters. 
 The story itself is interesting, but I wish the author had taken fewer pages to tell it. It is truly compelling in the first book. The world is diverse and the magic system(s) varied and deep. It has its weak parts too - the romance is a little off, Kvothe's stay at the University stretches, and the Ambrose angle reminds me too much of Draco Malfoy's antics. Childish and dark. 
 For those who care about such things, the books don't have story arcs of their own that finish when a book ends. Each is but an installment of a long story that could be chopped anywhere into two. But when I finished the first book, I deferred other reading plans and picked up the second book. 
 Rating: I give the first book 4 stars for the stunning debut and setup. Had little more happened in the second half of the book, or if the book had ended well, I would have given it 5 stars. The second book gets between 2 & 3 stars. The story meanders with more of the same. The events are less credible, and the space between them takes far too many pages. But the writing is still excellent. Overall, both books combined, it gets 3 stars. 
 Summary: Read it for the prose - its lovely. But if you are a plot person, be aware that the plot meanders, and doesn't come to logical points when the books end.""",2013-01-11 22:44:59,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)","fantasy,paranormal,fiction,young-adult,romance"

The sudden disappearance and tragic end were amazingly well written.

I really enjoyed the movie, but I never felt compelled to invest in any of the other adaptations. Then my buddy Steve read the original Matheson tale and let me know that the book was significantly different from the movie, and well worth the read. When I found out the eBook was available from my library, I really didn't have any other excuses. 
 The story presents an excellent perspective on the concept of the last man. How long would your sanity hold if you knew you were utterly alone, and that every day the world was trying to kill you? How long would you persevere, and how could you maintain hope? This story is much less about the vampire and much more about the human.

It felt like the author sat down and tried to come up with every possible bad thing that could happen to a girl in order to make the reader sympathetic towards Jenna. It backfired, because it's just not believable. There's a definite moment where Jenna becomes 2 different characters. I wasn't a fan of her in the 2nd half of the book. I thought she was immature and was acting out viciously 24/7. Kidd felt pretty two dimensional to me, so I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat to see how their romance would play out. I had a pretty ""meh"" attitude about it. 
 The thing about MC romance is that I think there's a whole lot of potential for more conflict that exists outside of the romance and it would kick the novel's complexity up a notch. So many subplots can form from a gang setting. Some authors take on the challenge, but many don't.

I'm sorry but having maybe one love triangle is fine but Reed seems to have to do battle with everyone except Zephyr over her - Russell, Brennus, Xavier et all. And all Evie does is lead them on and then boohoo about how confused she is. It's too much for me! 
 What is also too much for me is that the author will write whole chapters in Russell's or Brennus' accent. In my opinion, once you've informed the reader of the way a character speaks, there really is no need to go so overboard and bombard people with it to be honest. I do not need to read entire chapters like ""I bring me hand ta da bridge of me nose, pinching it in an attempt ta ease da ache dere."" Just make it clear that Brennus is Irish and then carry on writing in proper English! 
 Now onto the points I do like... Yet again, the cover is beautiful. Like, seriously one of the prettiest book covers I've seen. Bravo. 
 Zephyr - well he's just awesome. 
 When the story is being written in proper English, I think it's actually pretty good and enjoyed it. If only the whole thing could have been written that way. 
 Overall, I give it a solid 3.5* 
  Can't believe it's going to be dragged out to a 6th book though. Hopefully it doesn't lose even more structure just to drag Evie's story out. And dear lord, don't introduce ANOTHER admirer, please!

 I was sad to see this story end. This was a fast paced book with enough drama to keep it interesting. There were some very steamy scenes!!! It was also an interesting sexual preference, which I appreciated because everything seems to about bdsm lately. This book was not that. The ""rules"" to their sexual practices almost seemed to push the boundaries. There was no cheating, but I wondered a few times where the line was drawn, and I think the characters questioned this at times too. I think Julia actually gets the better end of the deal, as Brad's preferences are more driven by competition and his need to please his woman, rather than any need to be with multiple women. Julia is enough for him, so she gets to benefit from his needs rather than having to worry that Brad needing other women to be fully satisfied. I love the confidence and trust that Brad and Julia have in their relationship. 
 I didn't give it 5 stars because I wanted it to be longer. I wanted the story with Brad's family to be a bit more fleshed out. As the final book, I wanted to more of a complete ending, and even with the bonus chapter, I still had a few questions. I actually think the bonus chapter should be part of the epilogue. Overall though, I really loved this series, and most of all, I loved being introduced to Alessandra Torre through this series about a year ago. I've read a few of her other books now and have not been disappointed. I am a big fan of her work.

455,38568,3,"""Review from Backchatting Books 
 How do you help your 200 year old immortal daughter with hemaphobia? You kidnap a psychologist that specialises in phobias, of course. Not only does Lissianna's mother Marguerite do that, she ties Dr Greg Hewitt to Lissianna's bed and wraps a red ribbon around his neck, because you know packaging is everything. Lissianna however thinks he is dinner and has a quick bite - hence the name of the book - before the family intervenes. 
 I'm going to talk about the world building initially rather than the characters as I think the concept was pretty unique. Vampires actually originated from the technologically advanced, ancient Atlantis. They combined nanotechnology with bioengineering. These nanos which live inside their bodies require blood to keep the vampires in optimum condition. Vampires aren't allergic to the sun but it does mean the nanos have to work a bit harder to repair them and need more blood. It kept sparking memories of the epic science fiction show Red Dwarf which featured recalcitrant nanos. 
 Fearful of discovery, vampires no longer feed ""off the hoof"" but instead use blood banks to survive. Lissianna however is hemophobic which means she needs to either be fed blood intravenously or find victims she can feed off directly. Lissianna tries to combine her interest in social work with finding food and so works at a local shelter. She is affected by the blood she drinks so consuming the blood of a drunk or ill person affects her negatively. While the interactions between Lissianna and Greg were fun, they were not really deep and meaningful. I thought that Greg was far too calm and rational when he found out that vampires were real and got on the 'vampires are cool' bandwagon way too fast. For a psychologist he is fairly shallow - when he's tied to a bed in a strange house with a bladder that is about to burst he thinks that it would be great to be a sex slave for someone like Lissianna. Come on. Despite this, I loved the fact that life mates were unable to read each other's minds or control each other. This offered the chance for a true partnership rather than having one dominate over the other. 
 The secondary characters, or should I say cast of thousands were really distracting. Even with the best will in the world, I couldn't differentiate between the HEA fodder. Introducing all of them at once seemed a bit of a clumsy move even though I can understand that some characters were needed to assure Greg that Lissianna was sweet and really needed his help. The interactions between the secondary characters lacked some maturity. A pyjama for people over the age of 200 just seemed bizarre and for no purpose other than to allow the females to strut around in their rainbow of baby-doll lingerie. The villain of the piece was no better constructed as he basically had a neon sign pointing to him, yet Lissianna and the others were completely flummoxed. 
 This book is fun even though plot is uncomplicated and the outcome predictable. It is light, cheesy and delicious in small quantities.""",2012-12-22 14:28:53,A Quick Bite (Argeneau #1),"fantasy,paranormal,romance,fiction"

The thing is, for me Alison's heroes take a little getting used to. I never fall in love with them in my first read; well, except for Nash from Foolish Expectations. With him I fell in love at my first read. Coming back to On the Plus Side, I knew since I read Size Matters, that I would love Valerie and her story. 
 Valerie Carmichael is a lot of things I am not. She is confident in her sex appeal, happy with her body and knows that men drool over her. She is not hurting for anything. The only thing she does not have is her brother's best friend and her childhood crush, Logan Mathis. 
 Logan is back in the small town he fled from years ago. He just opened a new bar to help save his mother's home from getting foreclosed. He is determined to earn as much money as possible and as soon as possible. He doesn't have any time for a sexy distraction like his best friend's sister, Valerie. 
 Logan is the only man who has resisted Valerie. Valerie is the only woman Logan is tempted to have. This guaranteed a super-fun read, and Ms. Bliss did not disappoint. 
 On the Plus Side was undoubtedly an entertaining, fun and hot read. I loved how Valerie's ""Never-to-do-list"" turned into an ""Holy-hell-why-did-I-not-want-to-do-it-list"". This was one of the best parts of this book. While I loved Logan as an individual, as a friend and a son, sometimes the way her treated Valerie just grated on my nerves. But he is just human after all. Valerie also made some stupid decisions that hurt Logan badly. Her reason for what she did was just plain childish, but again, she is human. 
 The one character who highly irritated me though was Valerie's brother. He was an over-protective brother.. like way too over-protective. He behaved like Valerie was a 5-year-old kid rather than a 20 something woman. On the other hand, I loved seeing Sam and Leah. There is so much change that you can see in Leah since Size Matters. She has become a lot more confident and accepting of herself. 
 Overall, the book was really good. I'm eager to read Max's story though. I am hoping his girl gives him a lot of hell for all the mischief he causes.""",2016-12-10 05:23:19,On the Plus Side (A Perfect Fit #2),"romance,fiction"

 So, the 4th Tear Asunder book. 
 Wow, it feels like forever since I met Sculpt, and fell in love with him. 
 So here's a fun fact: Torn From You was the first Dark Romance book I read some 3-4 years ago, and it was the book that made me fall in love with the genre. And because of that, I will forever be grateful to Rose. 
 Kite, from the very first book had been an enigma- the quiet bandmate, everyone respected, but at the same time so different from the rest. 
 To say that I have been curious about him would be an understatement. 
 I have always wanted to know more about him, and it isn't even until the end of the 3rd book, in Shattered By You, that we even come to know of his name. 
 Killian Kane. 
 He was every bit the man I expected him to be. 
 Tormented, possessive and true to his words. 
 When he was 16 he met Savvy, and from the very first time, something about her called to him. But because both of them were very young and because Savvy had just lost her mother, he let's her go with the warning that next time he meets her, he won't. 
 Cue 11 years into the future. 
 Savvy is a dancer, but she has no where to work. Desperate for some sort of job, she goes to the boy she loved as a child to ask for some job recommendation. 
 I have to say, I really liked Savvy. She was so different from Rose's other female characters from the series, that she was in some ways, a real breath of fresh air. 
 She was a complete wildcard, and I kind of kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. Well, I was glad that it did not. Sometimes an uncomplicated character is the best thing you can do to the story. For me, she perfectly complimented Killian. 
 He was very complicated. As a child, he had been really abused by his father, and the loss of his mother and brother fucked him up. 
 I was a bit frustrated with the way Rose tried to portray his character though. So he's this lady killer, and is into the hardcore stuff.. but he's also a virgin? Yeah I found that a little too hard to believe. He was waiting for Savvy to come back? Really? Yeah that part was the thing I'm not buying. Either he's a kinky motherfucker, or he's a virgin- decide. You can't tell me he's a sex god on his first try. I feel like if I complain about that for the ladies, I should complain about the men too. He's nearly 28, and he's never had sex.. but he's also into hardcore BDSM, and has skills of a seasoned pro. Try and make sense of that. 
 Other than that little twist Rose tried to throw at us, I really liked it. 
 Although staying true to it's genre, it does deal with certain dark themes, Kept From You is a lot lighter compared to it's predecessors. It is the perfect conclusion to this brilliant series.""",2016-10-29 10:33:15,"Kept from You (Tear Asunder, #4)",romance

 Patrick Rothfuss' writing is like nothing else I've ever read. Each sentence feels so carefully and lovingly crafted, it makes me despair of ever writing anything as poetic and wonderful. I've probably read it four or five times, and I never get tired of it. I still tear up in the same places, even though I know what's going to happen.

461,22642971,4,"""This book. WOW. 
 I wasn't very impressed by Beth's Across the Universe trilogy so I was a little apprehensive about reading this, but The Body Electric sure as hell surprised me. In a fantastic way. 
 The setting 
 Like her previous trilogy, this is a futuristic story set in the 24th century. Normally, you wouldn't expect a standalone sci-fi novel to incorporate a solid background in, and this book wasn't an exception, but I like how Beth dedicated a short appendix to explain all the wars and stuff. Most importantly, everything in the book made sense. Most of the time, sci-fi stories focus on the use of technology by the government and hardly talk about the marketable aspect of it, so major props for the reverie business Ella's mum set up. People still need to eat after all. 
 The plot 
 In the first 10% of the book, when the PA (who practically singlehandedly stopped the Secessionary War 20 years ago) requests to meet Ella personally and all that jazz, it seemed like the special snowflake syndrome all over again and I was like 
 Though she's the daughter of two famous scientists, you don't exactly see Obama inviting seventeen year kids into the White House on an everyday basis. But in the end, it all adds up, so keep those judgy faces away for a bit. The rest is worth it. 
 Ella 
 Can I just give her a hell yeah? HELL YEAH. This girl knows what's going on. She may not know whether to trust those around her, but she never doubts herself. You don't have to be smart or sassy or whatever to be a strong heroine, you just need to know what you want and what you don't want. And she sure as heck does. 
 Plus when she first meets Jack the cutie in the graveyard and he acts all creepy and grabs her, she doesn't dig that weakass melt-into-a-puddle-of-goo shit, but instead punches him right in the face and keeps her finger on the panic button of her cufflink to call the police in case the dude turns dangerous. 
 When she's introduced to the ragtag rebel group, she demands answers and purposefully tries to force a confession out of them. In other books, you have that dumb girl believing everything the rebels say and betraying her whole family just to join the half-assed cause in two seconds. Not Ella.

462,186074,5,"""I usually fight giving anything a 5-star review, but this book truly deserved it. The typical good-vs-evil orphan-rising-to-become-savior fantasy story is getting a little tired point, but Rothfuss found a way to make it exciting and fun. I've heard this book called the beginning of a Harry-Potter-for-adults series, and the comparison does fit, but it brings so much of its own to the table that you soon overlook its similarities to anything else. 
 The characters I would have to rate highly. The hero and his school friends/enemies all are very strong and work dynamically off of each other. I do think we could have done with getting *to* the actual school a little earlier and saved quite a bit of length off of the book. The one character that raises my eyebrow is Denna; she runs so hot-and-cold that you eventually just give up trying to figure her out. 
 The main story of the book is framed by a side-story of it being dictated by the hero to a character named ""Chronicler"". It feels like once the backstory has been finished in future books it will then continue from the ""present"" timeline that Chronicler is writing from. The side-story also serves as a device to avoid following the typical hero's journey. For example: when someone he knows is accused of heresy and arrested by the church (at this point you expect some form of heroic rescue because pretty much any other fantasy book with this plot would do that,) the hero just shrugs it off and does nothing, dismissing it as ""this is my story, not his. Besides, he said he had friends who could help him from the inside."" After several scenes like that, you begin to wonder just how much artistic license is being taken or just how much is being left out by the hero, who confesses to enjoy ""telling stories"".

They were Chanel, black-textured with a peep toe and a gold zipper up the back, really more of a booty than a stiletto. And not what you'd ever call ""Fuck me"" shoes-there was nothing about them that would make a guy want to bed you, unless he was the type who liked a razor-sharp heel at his throat.""Finally getting around to writing some reviews for books I read earlier this year, as you can see I read this back in June. Better late than never, right? 
 When I first read the synopsis I was definitely intrigued. But my first thoughts were, ""Wait. Kate White? Doesn't she write those self-help kind of books?"" Close but no. I had no idea that she wrote a variety of different books until I came across Eyes On You on Edelweiss. Once I started reading I just didn't want to put the book down! You know the board game Clue? Well I felt like my Clue senses were tingling! I kept trying to figure out who was after Robin. I was torn between two characters at around 35% but then by 70% I knew for sure who it was but that didn't deteriorate me. 
 What kept Eyes On You from getting 5 stars? 
 At times I found myself I little confused with Robin's narration. At certain points I couldn't tell if she was making a statement or questioning something, which often had me going back a page and re-reading trying to figuring it out. But I've chalked this all up to the fact that it's an advanced ebook copy and there will most likely be changes by time it was published. 
 Overall, Eyes On You was a great mysterious read that kept me on my toes. I was so eager to get to the end, even when I guessed who the culprit was. I look forward to read more by Kate White, I noticed that she has two books coming out next year.

 I wasn't expecting a vampire story to be honest, mostly because I've watched the movie first and both turned out to be completely different. But I really liked how the author ""reinvented"" the myth of the vampire by giving it a scientific explanation. The writing was really easy to get into, and the story was really plausible. Even though I felt a little more connected to the main character in the movie, Robert Neville felt much more human and his reactions were honest. I never got bored, even though we only follow one character. 
 Also, I loved the contrast between the film and the book. Most of the time when I watch a movie adaptation I want it to follow exactly what's going on in the book, but in this case what I liked the most was all the differences between the two of them. And while the ending of the movie (+ the meaning of the title) seems to be more optimistic for the future, it's not the same at all in the book...

She takes up at a boarding house run by an older Irish woman, starts a new job secured by Father Flood, and eventually begins evening classes. We follow Eilis as she navigates a strange city, battles extreme homesickness, learns the ropes of her new job, and eventually falls in love. In the hands of anyone else, the subject matter may be downright dull. But Toibin's writing is something special- no lofty exaltation or sappy emotional breakdowns, but acute observations of the life of one very practical main character. So when tragedy strikes and Eilis's new world is turned upside down, we as readers are turned upside down with her. The sparse and precise writing in itself gives us a portrait of Eilis and her reactions that no verbose descriptions could. 
  Having said all this, Brooklyn would have been a five star review for me easily if it had not been for the last 40 or so pages. After showing so much growth and so much strength at adversity emerge in Eilis, Toibin spends those last pages telling us that a young woman who dares to branch out, to be bold, to fall in love, will surely come to regret it. I'd love to speak to the author about whether or not that was the intended implication of Eilis's regret at marrying Tony, but it was certainly my takeaway. Eilis's quick involvement with Jim also shifted our main character from pragmatic and strong to indecisive and prone to infatuation.

 Despite having a degree in English and having always been a fan of classic modern literature, I have never been a fan of Hemingway. His literature- in my personal opinion- seethes with misogyny and insecurity (neither one excusing the other). 
 In McLain's fictional account of Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley Richardson, a new voice- one easily forgotten by history- is brought to light. The following of Hadley sheds new light on Hemingway's own struggles and anxieties, but more than that, it flushes out the character of a woman burdened by her own family history and fighting to save love. The author writes in her afterward that she began to fall for young Hemingway when researching the book. I felt just the opposite. Though I sympathized with his difficulties in trying to maintain the ever tenuous feeling of ""being alive,"" his selfishness overwhelmed me. And I developed a deep feeling and worry fro Hadley. Her experiences and reactions to those experiences expressed my own deep fears about how easily one can be lost in the needs of another when in a relationship. Hadley spends much of the marriage finding her own strength and voice, and though she loves Hemingway, she learns to love herself more. 
 When I finally put this book down- sadly and with longing for more of the story- I immediately took to the internet to learn more about the real-life Hadley. After seeing photos and reading about her life after finally leaving Paris behind her, I felt even more bound to her as an inspiration. And though I did not feel about the famed author as McLain did, I could feel nothing but admiration for McLain herself.

480,11309018,4,"""A collection of short stories set in the Ranger's Apprentice universe - one of my favorite series. 
 Overall comments: 
 I went in thinking the set was mostly filling in various gaps of the other stories, and there are a few stories that do that, but a lot of the stories took place after book 10, and I almost feel like Flanagan wanted to write another book but knew he'd said it was done, so went this route instead. It would be ironic if that was the case, since another book is coming out now. ^_^ 
 Like any short story collection, some are better than others. It started a bit slow, for me, but picked up with the fourth story, 'Purple Prose', and I was reminded why I love this series so much - mostly for the characters and their various interactions. 
 It was nice to see some stories that highlighted other characters - Gilan, Jenny, Alyss - though I noticed that poor George seemed to have been left out of the proceedings entirely. 
 Overall, I ended up really enjoying the set, and recommend it to any fan. 
 Individual stories: 
 Right from the start I was put into a bit of a funk because I found the foreword a little depressing. 
 Basically, the foreword opens with an archaeological dig in the future of the RA world, and they are at Castle Redmont and the find the cottage and the collection of stories that are in this book. That's the framing story. 
 But, the thing is, I like to think of the characters in books I read as sort of timeless and eternal. Sort of living forever within the worlds of their stories - kind of like in the Thursday Next books, but less depressing 'cause they're not forced to just repeat the same pages over and over again. 
 Silly, I know, and I know it's kind of gleaned in the blurb... but I was prepared for it, and it made me a bit sad. 
 And then I wasn't sure what to make of the first story, 'Death of a Hero', which was also a bit depressing and also a bit ret-conny, though that's explained in the story. (2.5) 
 'Inkwell and the Dagger' was pretty good, and I liked to see Gilan get his own story, but there was something off about it. (3) 
 And then came 'The Roamers' which, again, was pretty good but not great, and I felt that Ebony being stolen was a bit too reminiscent of Tug getting lost in one of the books, and I was also a bit uncomfortable with some of the stereotypes - though, in fairness, this series has always sort of skirted that line. I did like seeing Alyss kick some butt, though. (3) 
 But then came 'Purple Prose', which I loved. Halt and Will were front and center, and the camaraderie between the two, the humor and friendship, reminded me what I love so much about the series. (5) 
 'Dinner for Five' was good, too, and we see more of Gilan, this time pair with Jenny. (3) 
 'The Bridal Dance' was, I think, the second best story. Many friends from throughout the series are brought together for Horace and Evanlyn's wedding, and Will is also front and center with a mystery to solve. (4) 
 'The Hibernian' is a cool look into Halt and Crowley's first meeting, and the beginning of their revival of the Ranger's. (3) 
 'The Wolf' was bittersweet, and left me a bit teary-eyed. It dealt with an issue with the horses which I had been wondering about myself, and it was handled well - though I was so miffed at Will for being so careless! - but, still... (3.5) 
 Lastly, 'And About Time, Too...' was a nice ending to the set, with a lot of d'awww attached. (4) 
 Overall, I'm pleased with the collection and the happy jujubees it left me with. :>""",2011-10-03 06:11:19,"The Lost Stories (Ranger's Apprentice, #11)","young-adult,fantasy,paranormal,fiction,history,historical fiction,biography,children,romance"

 The pacing was a bit slow, and it was definitely not one where I couldn't wait to get back into it. I did like Shandy and Davies and Skank. I think my favorite part was watching Shandy turn into a pirate and accept his role, and to find that they were, despite their wicked ways, actually good guys. Honor amongst thieves and all that. And I liked the magic and how it was explained, again I liked Shandy's development in this area, and I liked how the different types of loas where described and understood. He seemed to do a fair bit of research in this regard. 
 But beyond that, the characters were mostly flat, the romantic plot-line, while a driving force, felt sort of tacked on - but perhaps that's because Beth was such a damsel in distress, and I would've preferred a bit more Elizabeth Swan.

Totally un-put-down-able, Left Drowning is an exceptional love story full of very messed up, but completely beautiful people. Blythe is the girl with issues at the start - barely surviving after a tragedy that broke her world apart, when a chance meeting drives her to start living again. 
 Sabin is the first of the Shepherds that Blythe meets. Sabin is theatre guy - outrageous and crazy and full of life, dropping into Blythe's world and waking her up more than the coffee he stole ever could. Christopher comes next - grounding Blythe right from the start more than he knows. Estelle & Eric soon follow, each worming their way into her life in their own inimitable way. Chris may be the one she lusts after, but all of the Shepherds play their own part in bringing Blythe back to life, and I love that. 
 So, Christopher Shepherd. Wow. Be warned - this book is seriously sexy in parts. Chris does things to Blythe that made me want to swoon. Things may not always be plain sailing with these two - in fact their relationship is questionable at the best of times - but when they do get it on, they are hot! 
 The Shepherds offered Blythe family when she needed it most, but we mustn't overlook her own family, small as it is. If we cast aside the cold-fish aunt, we're left with James, Blythe's younger brother. He doesn't have a huge part to play lines-wise, but he does feature heavily in Blythe's past map of guilt and distress. He is an important character, and he is a sweetie. I'd rather like to hear his story, is if you're looking for inspiration, Ms Parks, how about giving James a voice? 
 One of the things Blythe doesn't realise, as they put her back together, is the full extent of the Shepherds' own painful tangle of issues. They do so well at hiding it, always looking forward, never casting an eye back to the past. Bit it's there alright, and you can't choose to ignore the past forever. At some point you're going to have to face up to it and deal with it. Can Blythe help the Shepherds' in the way that they helped her? 
 One of the things I especially loved was the way Parks intertwined the fates of these two lovers. She does it so gently that we don't even realise it at first, and neither do they. Little by little though, more is revealed, and you realise that there is more to this story than meets the eye. This involvement of fate rises Left Drowning way above the tide of NA that is currently flooding our shelves. Because this is more than just another NA book. This is one that you don't want to put down ever. I want the characters to be my best friends forever. I felt so good at the end, knowing that it wasn't really the end of the story, but a whole bunch of new beginnings.

484,59980,4,"""Batman: Year One is so much more than the four arc comics series collected within. Yes, it is kind of thrilling to see Batman before he was so invulnerable. Yes, the story of Lieutenant Gordan's move to Gotham and his fight to be a good cop in a bad city is excellently done. And yes, the way that this particular arc has no Big Bad but the city of Gotham itself - drawn to darkly corrupt perfection - is a terrific way to pare Batman down to who he is without the rogue's gallery of super villain foes. But the greatest thing about Batman: Year One is the inclusion of all the extras once the comic is finished. 
 The line drawings and essay from artist David Mazzucchelli (including his insightful take on the why the Batman/Robin dynamic is not homerotic), the back page poetic reminiscences of Frank Miller on his first entrance into Gotham as a boy, and the recreation of how a lot of the panels originally looked in the newsprint comic palate are all fantastic inclusions, and worth the read entirely on their merits alone. It's a little behind the scenes tour of Batman's recent history, and its a perfect capstone to this carefully respectful update to the Year One mythology. 
 As for the comic itself, because Batman at this point in the story is still a work in progress - still a creation that has yet to be fully formed - a lot of this story falls to Bruce Wayne. This is interesting, because of course as Batman's story goes on, Batman becomes so much more his identity, and Bruce Wayne turns into nothing but a convenient disguise. The features of Bruce Wayne are also drawn here to be a bit blocky, a bit blank. That's a nice touch. 
 We also get glimpses of those who become important to the story later on, especially Harvey Dent and Selina Kyle (with a tongue in cheek Vicki Vale mention thrown in for good measure). While I love what this version does with the both Gordon and Dent (still, in these early days, unscarred and heroic), I was not so much a fan of the Selina Kyle bits. I understand that they are making the case that if it hadn't been for Batman, Catwoman as we know her would have also ceased to exist, but unfortunately in this story, she doesn't have much to do. I do, however, think that Frank Miller did a great job with the other female characters. Barbara Gordon (the wife, not the daughter destined to be Batgirl and Oracle) is especially well done, and the relationship between her and Jim Gordon is rendered more convincingly than most marriages in literature. I also loved the way Mazzucchelli deliberately draws certain panels to resemble Zorro, in a nod to ""The Mask of Zorro"" being the movie the Waynes were watching together immediately before Bruce's parents were killed. 
 This is a good looking version of a fine rewrite of a classic story. You can't ask for better than that in a Year One comic.""",2011-03-04 06:55:31,Batman: Year One,"comics,graphic,fiction,mystery,thriller,crime,fantasy,paranormal,young-adult"

Late in the memoir, when Noah is an adult, he pays for his mother's hospital treatment, and my reaction was, wait he's rich now? how/when did he get rich? Lil bit confusing. 
 Nitpicks aside, this is a rare book that's educational and entertaining in equal measure. Recommended.

 This was a certain 4 star book until the end. I was even toying with the idea of 4.5 because I really liked the world, the characters and, of course, the feminism. Unfortunately, this novel's beautiful story was spoiled for me by its pacing. I found it quite slow getting started at the beginning and that was originally going to be my reason for a deduction. Then, bizarrely, then ending seemed really rushed to me. Literally, Leck's  death scene was a sentence. I had to reread it a few times because I thought 'What? That's it?' It came out of nowhere and then it was over before I'd even registered what was going on. I understand that it was a split second reaction and I know that Katsa reacted to it, but it all seemed so sudden to me and I didn't like that. I like detail and that isn't what I got here. Then, of course, the book didn't end there. I won't go into detail about events because I'm trying to avoid spoilers here, but when Katsa went off on her little 'quest', I was expecting about 100 more pages or so and instead I got not even 50. I loved the twist that happened at the end, that isn't at all what I'm upset about, but everything seemed to happen way too quickly and then we were left with a lot of loose ends. Again, I kind of had to sit there for a moment thinking 'Is that it?' It was an ending that left me wanting more, and not in a good way. That seems really strange to me because the amount of pages was just right, there was just too much padding at the beginning and not enough at the end. It's a shame because that spoiled things for me. 
 Other than the bizarre structure, this is a mostly good novel. It's very well written with vivid descriptions and imagery, which made me even more confused about the abrupt ending, and it's main characters were excellent. If you are a young feminist, then this is a novel that I'd recommend for you. The feminist themes throughout are very easy to spot and I enjoyed the novel in that respect. Also, the romance was absolutely beautiful. I'm very particular when it comes to romance in books, but this was exactly the kind of love story that I like. It was very subtle and Po is so respectful of Katsa's wishes. The love they shared for each other was obvious, but it developed quietly and it didn't turn into one of those melodramatic 'I can't live without you' kind of romances that appear so often in YA. I couldn't have been happier with the love story and I don't say that very often. Furthermore, I also liked Po and Katsa very much as characters. They were both very complicated and I enjoyed that. However, I found a few of the other characters to be quite two-dimensional. Bitterblue and Raffin were both OK, but I was left wanting more from both of them. The other side characters, however, were very flat. Katsa kept talking about how much she loves Oll and Helda and every time she did so, I found myself wondering why. We were told why, but we were never shown why because their characters were so underused. The 'show, don't tell' rule is one of the most important in fiction and I think that it could have been obeyed more in here. 
 The other thing about this novel that I didn't like was the other hints of romance. As I've already gushed, I loved the main romance, but two other characters also seemed to have feelings for Katsa and both of those left me feeling a little nauseous. I couldn't tell whether Raffin and Katsa were supposed to be written as friends or more than that. To me, it seemed like romantic tension between them and I was half expecting him to become her main love interest, which creeped me out a little bit because he's her cousin. Maybe that's just me and I'm misinterpreting the dynamic between them, but it bothered me a little. Also, I've noticed that failed marriage proposals or marriage proposals for the purpose of power over love are becoming more common in YA. I think this is the fifth book I've read this year which has used that plotline and that bothers me because I don't like it in most contexts. In one of those five books that I mentioned, I understood the reasoning for it and therefore didn't mind it. In another, there was a romance between the two characters so I didn't mind that either. In all of the others I've found it rather silly. It doesn't appeal to me as a plotline and I'm sick of seeing it. Please authors, if you're going to add a marriage proposal of any sort to your YA novel, make sure there's a justified reason for it. I'm becoming rather sick of reading the words 'marry me'. 
 All in all, I enjoyed this. I like the way that Cashore writes, but I'm not sure about her structuring and characterisation in some places. By far the best part of this novel was the story itself, but I also commend it for the main characters, the feminist messages and the very interesting twist at the end. I'm interested to read more from the Graceling Realm because I feel like there's a lot of room for improvement and, with an excellent storyline, I think Cashore could provide that. This world is good even if the author's execution of it isn't stellar. Therefore, I will read more in the hope of an improvement because if it does improve then I think that a book from this series has the potential to go onto my favourites shelf. Overall - decent, but disappointing.""",2013-07-25 08:44:31,"Graceling (Graceling Realm, #1)","fantasy,paranormal,young-adult,romance,fiction,mystery,thriller,crime"
501,186074,3,"""First off, to the friend who recommended this book so highly and was so excited for me to read this: I'm so sorry. 
 (2.5) 
 The book begins as a scribe visits an inkeeper who, of course, is much more than your average inkeeper. He's this legendary Kvothe, who's done all this and that and who's all powerful, and the scribe has come to write down his story. So this book is the first part of Kvothe's story told in Kvothe's voice. 
 The writing is beautiful, and I'm easily absorbed into the story. I find myself thinking about the book when I'm not reading, which is great! But then there's so much I didn't like about it that overshadows what I liked about the book. 
 Kvothe is haughty as all hell and unbearable as an MC because of it. Most of the time, I can't stand him. The only character I began to like was Bast, one of the fae, who had a character that wasn't just limited to ""jovial supportive character talking about women"" or ""empathizing supportive character talking about women"". Sure he talks about women, but there was actual depth to him other characters lacked--their world was limited to their interactions with Kvothe. And yeah, yeah, it makes sense because this is Kvothe telling the story, but as a reader it wasn't such a fun experience, especially when the book is over 600 pages. 
 There's also a disgusting lack of women here--it's even pointed out by Bast at one point. If it's even pointed out by a character within your story, you should know you have a fundamental problem. Sure, there's the ""love interest"", Denna, who comes and goes because she's so independent, and Devi, a shady businesswoman, but one or two strong women in a story with, what? 25+ male characters does't make up for the difference. 
 Because for real, every girl or woman Kvothe meets is measured by how beautiful she is. When one girl sings beautifully while he plays, he naturally tries to find her afterward in the crowd. But the only girls he considers are the beautiful ones, because only pretty girls can have beautiful voices, right? Women are talked about like objects from the very beginning, and by every male character. God, it's wearying. 
 There's also a marked lack--and by that I mean absolutely zero--of nonwhite characters. How does this entire world exist but contain only white people? There's even people called the Ruh who have cultural identities based off nonwhite cultures in our world, but in Patrick Rothfuss's world . . . they're white. That's such a disgusting use of cultural appropriation. 
 So I'm sorry, friend, what I enjoyed didn't make up for what I didn't enjoy. :(""",2015-01-09 14:06:15,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)","fantasy,paranormal,fiction,young-adult,romance"
502,14975,3,"""(actually 3.5 rounded down) 
 To be honest, there was a lot more in this book that I liked than I disliked, but I think it's mostly the writing and organization that gives this novel a low rating. 
 Pacing was not consistent throughout the novel and it put me off. It starts off at a very slow, deliberate pace. Then three quarters the way through it picks up lighting-fast and becomes this great page-turner only to have it drop and describe the rest of the plot in a narrative between two characters. The first half goes into detail about the politics and relationships and the development of characters I assumed were vital to the story only to have the last third mention what happened to them and (in some cases) their deaths in passing. 
 Don't get me wrong, there was much I liked about this book, the way it combined past and present one of them. I had thought from the beginning that the past-present connection would be cheesy and was dreading the moment the connection happened, but it was actually pretty heartfelt and meaningful. I really enjoyed that part. 
 Some characters were not as fleshed out as others (even though they were the main characters) but others were gloriously three-dimensional and won my heart. Guilhem in particular is in my opinion the strongest character and what kept the book going near the end for me. 
 All in all, this book had great depth in politics and atmosphere and setting but lacked in development and organization. Still a good and interesting read, though.""",2012-02-23 07:43:04,"Labyrinth (Languedoc, #1)","fiction,history,historical fiction,biography,fantasy,paranormal,mystery,thriller,crime,romance"

 WOW....Hold on to your panties ladies because Alessandra Torre is about to take you on a sexy ride. And when i say sexy, i mean panty-melting hot, need a cold shower right now sexy. This, is my opinion, her hottest book yet. 
 One of the things I loved so much about MI was the added element of suspense and this book was no different. Right from the prologue you know there is danger lurking in the shadows. And every time it started to slip your mind,a little reminder was thrown in that kept you turning the pages. I just couldn't put this book down. But just as badly as I wanted to know what happened, I also didn't want Brad and Julia's story to end. 
 When we first met Brad DeLuca in Blindfolded Innocence he was the epitome of rich playboy. In Masked Innocence he changed his ways and fell hard for Julia. But it was in End of the Innocence that his love and dedication to Julia really shined through the pages. Is it sad to be jealous of Julia....maybe. But she has Brad and i want him for myself. 
 EOTI starts right where MI left off. Recently engaged, Julia has to deal with meeting Brad's family as well as the aftermath of telling the women of the law firm about her engagement, who were less than understanding. I love how her confidence as a person and with her sexuality really developed in this book. She stood tall and proud, proving that nothing and no one could come between her and Brad. 
 This is one of the best trilogies I have ever read. Alessandra left no stones unturned, no questions unanswered in the conclusion of this series. All while delivering one of the sexiest books i've ever read. The love shared between Brad and Julia is undeniable. Soul mates. The trust they have in each other is inspiring. Alessandra's writing is magic, leaving you so engrossed in the story that the world around you disappears.
