 Because the movie was so strange, and difficult to follow, I kept putting off reading the book. I was worried I'd run into more of the same, except dragged out over pages of boring opacity. 
 I was right and I was wrong. There was something good there, and it was not boring or opaque. The book had a great mix of philosophy, character development, world-building, dialogue, and inner monologue. I would read this again because I know I would stay entertained and I would probably pick something new up. 
 Easy recommendation.""",2014-01-31 13:47:44,Solaris: The Definitive Edition,fiction;fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime

105,186074,5,"""I love a good frame story. That's what this was. You had the outer story, with the Chronicler and the tavern, and the inner story, Kvothe's life story...from his point of view...and he's kind of a jerk. 
 How much can we trust what he tells us? Then there MORE stories that were scattered within the inner story, adding even more layers. 
 I really liked the stress on money in this book. The reader is constantly aware of how much of an issue it is and how poor Kvothe is. He's living from moment to moment...every decision could financially break him, which would lead to the end of his education and current life. Such a little thing...but part of daily life and a constant stress for many many people. It's interesting to find it here....I read a lot of fantasy. Characters tend to use magic and materials willy-nilly and finances are very seldom addressed at all. Kvothe's constant economic crisis is a very real worry and an interesting choice in a fantasy novel. Poverty shapes a person...with the way it is highlighted throughout this book, I would expect that it's an issue that continues to effect him in the future. 
 I wanted so much MORE though! I have so many questions! Why is he hiding in a tavern? Why doesn't he do magic or music?? What is Bast up to and how did the two end up together?? Kvothe promises a legendary story...but TNOTW only touches on his start, promising so much more to come. 
 and I hate Denna. That is all I have to say about her.""",2017-03-08 17:09:10,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",fantasy;paranormal;fiction;young-adult;romance
106,31549837,5,"""ARC provided by author in exchange for an honest review 
 So before I begin my review, I think it would be fitting to write a letter to the author since Kandi Steiner told us a story that was aptly titled: A Love Letter To Whiskey. 
 Dear Kandi Steiner, 
 It's 2:30 am and I just spend the last three hours getting lost or in this case drunk on your lyrical and poignant prose. How can this one story consume me? Have me strangely intoxicated? Addicted? It's simple. One taste of your raw words was all it took. It didn't take much because shot after shot of your literary brilliance, you left me feeling numb, high and sated. I wanted to drown in whiskey. I wanted to feel whiskey. I wanted to be vulnerable to whiskey. I wanted to love whiskey. I wanted to hate whiskey but I couldn't because whiskey didn't consume me. It was your words Kandi Steiner that I was addicted to. 
 ""It turned out a Whiskey stain was just as permanent as ink, and I wondered if I would ever truly wash myself clean. Or if I even wanted to."" 
 This story. These characters. These words. These emotions that you had coursing through my veins was the very essence of why I love to read. This was not a story of perfect characters but instead of flawed individuals who continued to make mistakes after mistakes. Individuals who hurt each other emotionally. So how could I be intoxicated on a story where cheating occurred multiple times? The answer to that is simple. Love is complicated. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is beauty. Love is truth. And the truth of the matter, love can be selfish. Love can be cruel. Love can be an addiction. Good and bad. It can be toxic. But love can make you feel. And the story of Jamie and B was a story that I will happily drown in over and over again. Why would I torture myself in such a complicated love story? Because love is meant to be consuming and a story that makes you feel every fiber of emotions coursing through your veins is a story worth remembering. And this is one love letter to whiskey where I will savor every last drop. 
 ""My first taste of Whiskey had been nothing. My first shot? Child's play. I'd been holding back, delicately balancing on the line, afraid of drinking too much --but this was it. I knew it. I felt every inch of the fall from tipsy to drunk. I was completely wasted, and all I wanted was to feel this way forever."" 
 Sincerely, 
 ~Michelle xo 
 Emotionally consuming. Intoxicating. Raw. Flawed. And breathtakingly poignant. These are the words that immediately comes to mind as I sit here in write my review for A Love Letter to Whiskey. Kandi Steiner honestly blew me away with this book. In the three hours that I was held hostage, I felt like I was on an emotional roller-coaster going through the motions and the unexpected twist and turns. In all honesty, I needed a drink after reading this book because my heart and emotions were scattered and beating wildly as I drank in every mistake, love, hurt, and loss the hero and heroine experienced. 
 ""Jamie was whiskey, that much I was sure of. I couldn't deny the way he burned, the way his taste lingered."" 
 That first taste. Once you had your first drop of love, it's a high and addiction that you can't forget. The buzz that you crave. For Breck, her addiction came in the form of a boy who knocked her world off its axis. The boy she knew who was top shelf material. Yeah he was that drink that was rich, smooth and left a good burn. And that drink was her very own whiskey named Jamie. 
 ""I was spinning, tipsy, teetering on the edge of being wasted on Whiskey. I'd dreamed of kissing Jamie so many times, but nothing could compare to how it really felt --his hands on me, so strong, his mouth skilled and passionate. My legs were weak and he felt it, taking the weight of me in his arms, kissing me like he'd waited his entire life to have the chance."" 
 Jamie and B's relationship was built on a friendship that was held by truth, love, and an indescribable connection. To sum it up, it was intense. But like any friendship when feelings are involved, lines would get blurred. And the timing of Jamie and B was never right.When she was single, he was in a relationship. When he was ready for her, she wasn't available. But as much as the timing was never right, their feelings were always there but miscommunication and timing was always their downfall. She wasn't ready to be fully consumed with whiskey even though she already knew she was drowning in it. 
 ""It turned out I was water, he was whiskey, and I couldn't dilute him --not now that I knew he loved me enough to let me. I needed to be stronger, to be ice the next time I melted with him."" 
 A Love Letter to Whiskey is an utterly raw gripping addictive read. This book was built on a symphony of raw emotions. Emotions that left you frazzled, confused, hurt, angry, sad, and wildly intoxicated. Steiner did not write an ordinary love story but instead a story that left you savoring every drop of her poetic and stunning prose. To the very last drop, you will want a taste of whiskey. You will want to know and experience a selfish kind of love. An addictive kind of love. And most importantly a love that is honest. Real. Raw. A love that leaves you vulnerable and breathless. And so if you are ready to take a sip and get your first taste of a literary masterpiece then I urge you to get drunk on this book. Take a sip, savor the taste, and enjoy the lasting aftertaste of whiskey or in this case Kandi Steiner's words. 
 ""Even if you must move on, please don't ever let us go.""

 The characters were hard to like. I wanted to like Charlie, I did, but I like my heroines a little more imperfect. I got to about 25% in and the whole time I was cringing at him trying again and again to corrupt her. Not a great feeling. 
 Didn't really like the storyline. The whole ""soul-collecting"" thing was beyond my comprehension. Meh.

230,17980013,5,"""5++++++ Faetastic Stars! 
 I discovered Fighting Destiny when I saw a few Goodreads friends reading it and thought, what the heck I will give it a try. I was hooked from the very first page and was dying to read the next book in the series. However, I used some self control since I had a ton of books waiting for me on my kindle to read and a bunch of ARC's to finish. However, while planning to leave on a vacation I thought what the heck now is a good time to treat myself and go ahead and read the next book in this series and see what happens to Syn. 
 So not disappointed. It is rare that a second book in a series is as good as the first especially when one has high expectations. This is one of those rare finds. I devoured this book, could not put it down. 
 Let me say I love Syn, she is a kick ass heroine, who is still very loving and very feminine. There is no resisting this woman. Syn has found herself a member of a world she was taught to hate, hunt, and kill. Now she is fighting turning into one of them. However, no matter how much she denies what she is there is not avoiding it. 
 Ryder is the man (Fae) she can't stay away from but she still doesn't fully trust him, yet he is the only one who can help her become who she is meant to be. I really don't want to go too much into the details of this book because it is filled with twists and turns, passion and surprises and I would hate to spoil any of them. 
 I will only say one thing..... YOU MUST READ THIS SERIES!! You will be so glad you did. It has everything, passion (lots and lots) romance, love, action, mystery. The supporting characters are almost as fantastic as the main ones. Trust me when I say you will be so glad you read this book. Prepare to enter a complete world of fiction and to leave believing every moment of it was real.""",2014-02-17 13:24:45,"Taunting Destiny (The Fae Chronicles, #2)",fantasy;paranormal;romance;mystery;thriller;crime;fiction
267,19057,2,"""I admit I got almost nowhere with this, the book might be great but I couldn't handle the tone of the protagonist. As in I couldn't handle both the voice and the use of the vernacular.

I make no judgement on the plot as I couldn't get far enough to have an opinion.""",2016-04-21 09:19:38,I Am the Messenger,young-adult;fiction;mystery;thriller;crime;romance;fantasy;paranormal

 It was the ending that got me. 
 Throughout the book, there was nothing, nothing, that made me like Scarlet, the main character. It's not that I didn't like her; I just don't have an opinion on her. I did like Jesse, the shy boy though. And I feel like Scarlet didn't deserve Jesse, this beautiful shy boy who gave her gifts and blushed into pomegranate colors when he saw her, while Scarlet only had eyes for her sister's husband, Hayden, noting Jesse's un-confidence and wavering, believing he was simply not good enough, or not as good as Hayden.

 (First review -- July 2011) I don't think that I would have done well in 1920's Paris because 1) I can't drink that much; and 2) I would have beat both Ernest and Pauline over their heads with a baseball bat, and if I couldn't find a baseball bat in Paris, I would at least have used a very stale batard. 
 I really did enjoy the views of the life the Hemingways led. They were terribly strapped for cash and lived in a dive, but had a maid/nanny, and took skiing vacations in Austria, summer vacations on the Riviera, and traveled yearly to Spain for the running of the bulls. A number of years ago I read The Hemingway Women by Bernice Kert and found it fascinating, and I think I will look at it again. Hemingway's life is so interesting to me, but I do not like his writing. Reading The Paris Wife, which covers the time Hemingway was writing The Sun Also Rises, makes me want to read that book.

The parts I loved were great, and the rest of the book was incredibly boring. This book was the same, but more hate than love. It's just... BORING. An incredibly interesting concept, in-depth writing (reminds me of Hobb), but somehow the author manages to make it boring. That's some skill, right there. 
 And OH GOD the commas! I hate with a burning passion the way this book used commas/tenses.
