037583687X,,False,3.98,"It's 1953 and 11-year-old Penny dreams of a summer of butter pecan ice cream, swimming, and baseball. But nothing's that easy in Penny's family. For starters, she can't go swimming because her mother's afraid she'll catch polio at the pool. To make matters worse, her favorite uncle is living in a car. Her Nonny cries every time her father's name is mentioned. And the two sides of her family aren't speaking to each other!
Inspired by Newbery Honor winner Jennifer Holm's own Italian American family, Penny from Heaven is a shining story about the everyday and the extraordinary, about a time in America's history, not all that long ago, when being Italian meant that you were the enemy. But most of all, it's a story about families--about the things that tear them apart and bring them together. And Holm tells it with all the richness and the layers, the love and the laughter of a Sunday dinner at Nonny's. So pull up a chair and enjoy the feast!

0609605224,,False,3.02,"A Boy in Wintertakes the stuff of newspaper headlines and explores, in a taut, deeply moving narrative, the human passions behind it.
After Nancy Horvath and her eleven-year-old son, Danny, move into their dream house, Danny becomes fast friends with ten-year-old Eddie Nova, the boy next door. Eddie is a hyperactive, difficult child, both boon companion and bane of Danny's existence. Meanwhile, Nancy's helpful, neighborly relationship with Eddie's father, Frank, becomes a passionate affair. Frank is the partner Nancy wishes she had, and the father Danny has always longed for. Then one day, Eddie brings over a hunting bow and playfully aims it at Danny and his dog. In a tragic mishap, Danny accidentally shoots and kills his friend.
The novel traces the repercussions of that accident--in Nancy's voice, in Danny's voice, and from Frank's point of view. Danny's extraordinary account of the events that led up to the action is a heartbreaking, pitch-perfect record of the complications of love, the weight of isolation, and the ultimate opacity of intention and motivation. How Nancy's fierce, enduring love for her son sustains a future for him and how Frank's devastating loss and guilt play into that future provide drama-tic counterpoint to Danny's painful dissection of what he has done.
With stunning imagination and an almost sculptural elegance of storytelling, Maxine Cher-noff balances the radical shock of tragedy with the hard-won optimism of survival. She brilliantly enacts how a child stunned by grief and the adults who love him reclaim their trust in the future. Ultimately, A Boy in Wintertestifies to the power of parental love and steadfast friendship to provide hope and faith in the face of tragedy.",Hardcover,Crown,256,9780609605226,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,977525,A Boy in Winter,1999-09-14,fiction;poetry;mystery;thriller;crime,Maxine Chernoff
